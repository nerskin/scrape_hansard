                  </a>  I think there was limited discretion that was available to the Speaker on that particular issue. I say, though, that, with the number of speakers who are on the list, I do believe we will need to do more than what is in this current resolution. I indicate to the government that the opposition is willing to work with any further additional hours. Anything that has an agreement that all speeches go for 10 minutes rather than 15—as long as it's all at 15, our members will use the time as well, but, if there's agreement to go to 10, we're very happy to facilitate that. I am concerned that, if we let the debate go too long, we'll end up with other members who want to move amendments feeling frustrated with the time available. There is goodwill across the chamber, and we want to make sure, particularly on a conscience vote issue, that no debate is gagged and everyone get the opportunity to make their speeches. In saying that, we support the resolution.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  On the debate itself, if I could just make a couple of remarks, as seems timely now: obviously, on a question like this there are strong views, and the House recognises that, despite anyone's views, it's a historic proposition before the House. We've seen members wearing badges, which I think is on the right side of the line. I notice the member for Leichhardt's got a tie, which he wore yesterday, which is completely within the standing orders. That's fine. I just want to say to members my preference is that we don't keep extending props on the subject. We do have rules on props, and they're well known. I do need to point that out. At the conclusion of a long debate, it is reasonable that more tolerance will be shown by the chair. I just want to make that point. It's probably easier if I make the point that way. To date, it's been perfectly proper. I commend the member for Leichhardt and those who have spoken so far. We like to be able to compare ourselves with the other place favourably.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CHRISTENSEN:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—This is the first inquiry report of the Publications Joint Committee in 10 years. The previous report of the committee was also into the printing standards of documents presented to parliament. This report provides a revision of those standards that were set in 2007. The Publications Joint Committee sets the printing standards for documents that are presented to this parliament. As you're aware, Mr Speaker, thousands of documents are presented to parliament each year. Most of these are required to be presented by law. That includes documents such as annual reports of Commonwealth entities, reports of royal commissions, reports of other government inquiries, parliamentary committee reports and other periodic reports with statutory requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of presenting documents to parliament is to keep the parliament and, through it, the Australian public informed of the government's activities. At the heart of the practice of presenting documents is maintaining government accountability. In the 10 years between the two reports of the committee, a number of developments have occurred which make this review of standards timely. They include the parliamentary paper series becoming a digital-only series, developments in printing capabilities and technology, and the continually growing expectation that documents are accessible through electronic mediums. In the past, the printing standards provided guidance to government entities, authorities and companies on issues such as format, the use of colour and illustrations, and the type and size of paper. A number of arguments were put to the committee that these standards should be relaxed to allow for greater flexibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite advances in technology, though, and an increasing preference for accessing such publications electronically, documents printed in hard-copy format are still very much pertinent. The committee, therefore, has agreed to relax the standards to allow flexibility while ensuring the ongoing integrity of parliamentary documents. In relation to electronic documents, the committee has made a number of recommendations, including that the Digital Transformation Agency, in consultation with the Department of Finance, develop a minimum set of standards for electronic documents and that the Department of Parliamentary Services develop a dedicated web interface with appropriate functionality for locating and accessing electronically tabled documents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area the committee explored is the possibility of presenting documents to parliament electronically. The committee endorses this idea and has made a recommendation that the parliamentary departments, together with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, develop a system that would facilitate the embargoed delivery of digital documents for the purpose of electronic tabling of these documents before parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the committee has made a recommendation to each house of parliament which, if agreed to, will streamline the procedural process for making tabled documents parliamentary papers. That's getting rid of process and red tape, which is a good thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the committee is keen to ensure that government and parliamentary information remains accessible in whatever form that information is made available. The committee is confident that the revised standards, the recommendations we have made today, will provide author bodies with sufficient flexibility for their evolving needs to satisfy public demand for digital dissemination of information and ensure the ongoing integrity of access to parliamentary records and maintain the accountability of the government of the day. I therefore recommend this report and the recommendations to the House.</span>

The Criminal Code enables the committee to review the listing of terrorist organisations and report its findings to the parliament within the 15-day disallowance period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Islamic State East Asia is comprised of a number of extremist organisations that publicly pledged allegiance to Islamic State in December 2015. Since merging, the group's members have conducted increasingly violent attacks in the Philippines, very similar to those conducted by Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. This includes a large-scale attack in Marawi City in May 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conducting its review, the committee held a private hearing with ASIO and the Attorney-General's Department. The committee carefully reviewed the procedures followed by the government and the merits of the listing themselves. The committee was satisfied that appropriate processes had been followed and that Islamic State East Asia meets the relevant thresholds to be listed as a terrorist organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee therefore supports the listing and finds no reason to disallow the legislative instrument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second report I am presenting today outlines the committee's activities for 2016-17.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national focus on counterterrorism measures continued throughout this year with further legislative reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee maintained its bipartisan approach to reviewing proposed changes to Australia's national security legislation and completed inquiries into four bills referred by the Attorney-General. These bills included continuing detention for high-risk terrorist offenders and telecommunications sector security reforms. The committee made 39 recommendations to strengthen the bills and ensure that they included appropriate safeguards and oversight mechanisms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the government accepted all of the committee's recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also continued to fulfil its key statutory oversight responsibilities, including its annual review of the administration and expenditure of the six Australian intelligence agencies as required by the Intelligence Services Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee completed its review for the 2014-15 year and commenced its review for 2015-16. As in previous years, the committee sought assurances that each agency continued to have the necessary resources to address Australia's national security priorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee concluded that agencies were overseeing their administration and expenditure appropriately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Briefly, I note that during this period the committee also conducted its third review of the AFP's performance of its functions under part 5.3 of the Criminal Code; and reviewed and supported the listing or re-listing of 10 terrorist organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first time this year, the committee reviewed the declaration of a terrorist organisation under the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 following the declaration of Islamic State on 4 May 2016. This means that a person aged 14 or older who is a national citizen of another country loses their Australian citizenship if they are a member of Islamic State or act on instruction of, or in cooperation with, Islamic State.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the committee commenced its statutory review of division 3 of part III of the Australian Security Intelligence Act 1979—ASIO's questioning and detention powers—which is due to sunset in September 2018. The outcomes of this review will be reported on in next year's annual report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was further expansion of the committee's oversight responsibilities during the year. The Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016 and Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016 were amended to include provisions requiring the committee to review the operation of the legislation within six years and three years respectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the committee recognises that the recommendations of the 2017 independent intelligence review will, if accepted, have significant implications for the committee's ongoing oversight remit. The committee will closely monitor implementation of these arrangements and will work to ensure they are as effective as possible. I commend the reports to the House.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I've had the privilege of serving the people of Fisher and, more broadly, the Australian people for only 18 months. It's been the greatest privilege of my life, but with every privilege comes responsibility, and it is now my responsibility as the member for Fisher to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 and to vote in accordance with my conscience. I thank the Prime Minister for affording me that opportunity. I think it is fair to surmise that few bills will generate as much controversy and consternation amongst the Australian people as the one which is the subject of this debate. As a barrister, I acted as counsel assisting the coroner in respect of a number of road deaths north of the Sunshine Coast. The coroner, Maxine Baldwin, would often remark that, in her role, she needed 'the patience of Job and the wisdom of Solomon'. I find myself wishing today, as I often do, that I, too, had Solomon's wisdom as I prosecute my responsibilities as a parliamentarian. I closed my maiden speech in this place with a prayer written by Reinhold Niebuhr, a prayer which I should like to open this speech with today:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue of same-sex marriage is a deeply personal one for many Australians and for many more Australian families. Many of us have a story to tell about same-sex marriage, and these stories illustrate and illuminate the complexity of the legislative challenge before us. Like many colleagues, in contributing to this debate I'd like to tell the House about my own experience and the experience of my family, which has brought me to my position today. This issue has perplexed me for a number of years. I'm a practising, committed Catholic. I do my best to go to church every Sunday. In fact, in my late teens, I joined a monastery, willing to give my life to God through the service of others. The teachings of the Catholic Church on the issue on marriage are very clear. The church teaches that marriage is between a man and a woman, to the exclusion of all others, for life. There is no ambiguity in that stance. It is a stance which I shared for most of my adult life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My daughter, Caroline, struggled through much of her teenage years with mental illness. She suffered from an insidious disease, an eating disorder, most notably anorexia and bulimia. My wife and I watched our beautiful daughter—our girls, their sister—fight her demons as she slowly became nothing more than skin and bone, in and out of hospital for long stretches of time over a number of years. She would wax and wane between sheer determination to regain her health and utter desperation, sinking into the abyss of feeling that there was no hope of an end to this internal conflict. As a dad, I'm very pleased and proud to say that my daughter is now in a much healthier and happier place. She has a terrific job and a wonderful partner who our family love very much.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this story have to do with same-sex marriage, you may ask? About three years ago, our daughter told my wife and me that she was attracted to women and that she had a girlfriend. My wife and I were shocked, probably more me than my wife. I didn't know what to say. Homosexuality went against what I had been taught to believe for many years. How could this be happening? How could this be happening to me and to our family? Whilst she'd had boyfriends, she has since told me that it never felt quite right, and that she felt that she couldn't tell us as we would not approve. She said she had always secretly been attracted to women, and I'm sure that this internal conflict would have, in some part at least, exacerbated her mental state. My daughter said something to me which was very prophetic in that initial discussion. She said, 'Dad, in the years to come, my generation will look back and judge your generation about how you deal with the issue of homosexuality in the same way that your generation considered your parents' generation in the way that they dealt with our Indigenous people.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this country, we do not discriminate against someone because of the colour of their skin, their religion or their place of birth. In law, we are all created equally, and so we ought not in law discriminate against a person by virtue of their sexual preference. In this lies the value of the distinction between church and state. It reminds us of our constitutional forefathers' foresight in ensuring that no faith should be recognised by the state as a sanctioned religion. The tenants of the Roman Catholic Church, or any church or religion for that matter, ought not and must never be permitted to override our civil laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I stood for preselection for the seat of Fisher in April 2016, it was Liberal Party policy that we would take the issue of same-sex marriage to the people by way of holding a plebiscite. That was a policy introduced by the then Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, and a policy which the current Prime Minister, the member for Wentworth, rightly continued. Nonetheless, the issue of same-sex marriage remained the subject of passionate debate within the rank and file of our party. I ran my preselection on the basis that I would support the will of the Australian people, as expressed in a plebiscite. I have maintained that position ever since. The plebiscite came in for a great deal of public ridicule from the left side of politics. Labor and the Greens sought to block it at every step of the way, including all the way to the High Court of Australia. In my view, from the beginning, they fought the plebiscite not because of some philanthropic motive; I believe that this was unfortunately yet another example of the Leader of the Opposition playing rank divisive politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, many Australians wanted the opportunity to have their say. The fact that almost 80 per cent of Australians took part in a voluntary survey is testament to that fact. We were warned that a plebiscite or a postal survey would lead to ugly scenes of vilification. We were warned that this would be a demonstration of Australians at their worst. I'm very pleased and proud to say that those opposite could not have been more wrong about Australians. Australians are a generous, tolerant, respectful and open-minded lot. We are egalitarian. We have no social class structures. We intrinsically know the difference between right and wrong. We are a decent, harmonious, multicultural society who believe in giving our mates a fair go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians supported marriage equality in strength and in numbers that surprised me. Over 61.6 per cent of Australians supported same-sex marriage nationwide and even more in my seat of Fisher, with 62.8 per cent support. I promised the Australian people that I would respect and support their decision and I intend to honour that commitment. However, I firmly believe that there are a number of amendments that should be made to the bill in order to protect religious freedoms. I will have more to say about those protections when I speak on those amendments later during the week. Suffice to say, I believe very strongly in the right to practice one's religion; the right of freedom of expression ought not be trampled by the majority. Almost five million Australians who voted no to same-sex marriage deserve to have a voice in this parliament and they deserve to have their rights enshrined in legislation. We need to put beyond doubt in this bill that their views are equally as important as those who supported this change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill recognises that there is a distinction between a religious or church wedding and a marriage recognised by the laws of the Commonwealth. Churches of all faiths and religious ministers of all faiths will be permitted to lawfully decline to marry same-sex couples and decline to provide services and facilities such as church halls for same-sex couples' ceremonies and receptions. This, in my view, is right and proper. But the bill should provide greater protections, and I look forward to speaking about those in the debates concerning those amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  I am honoured and proud to rise in this House today to support this Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, but I want to make it very clear I will not be supporting any amendments. This bill is about the definition of 'marriage'. Marriage equality is fundamentally about equality and human rights. This is a very emotional time for me personally, for my husband, our family and in particular for our youngest daughter, Louise, who is here in this place today. I want to pay my respects to the elders of the LGBTIQ community, the men and women who never gave up and who paved the way for this legislation, the men and women who suffered dreadful discrimination, hate and violence, simply because they belonged to LGBTIQ communities and believed in equality. I am not normally an openly emotional person but, when the results of the survey were announced, I was overcome with emotion because my youngest daughter could now get married like her siblings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am so proud to represent the electorate of Herbert. Thank you to 62.8 per cent of the Herbert electorate who delivered an emphatic yes in support of marriage equality. In Herbert, 48,110 people stood up and did what the Turnbull government did not have the guts to do in parliament. My community have stood up for the minority and I am honoured to deliver this speech supporting their resounding 'yes' vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">LGBTIQ communities around this nation have suffered through 22 amendments of the Marriage Act 1961, all of which did nothing to support their communities. And of those 22 amendments, the one moved on 16 August 2004 was the worst because this was when Prime Minister John Howard shamefully changed the definition of marriage to mean:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But today, we are here to right that wrong. Nothing will give me more pleasure and satisfaction than knowing that my grandchildren and future great grandchildren will know that I stood in this place on the right side of history supporting marriage equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My community and I did not want this $122 million of taxpayers' money spent on a divisive national survey. We knew the destruction it would cause and the distress and hurt that it would cause so many people. The LGBTIQ community were forced to have this survey and throughout this process they remained positive and determined and, as a result of their strong and committed campaigning efforts, they achieved a resounding 'yes' victory. There are so many faces, advocates and stories from the people of Herbert whose actions have collectively led to this momentous occasion, and I would like to share a few of these stories with the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to talk about Luke Cashion-Lozell. Luke and his partner, James, met over a decade ago. In that time, they have lived together, started businesses together and, short of starting a family together, the one thing that they wanted most was to be married in Australia, their birthplace and their home. They wanted their relationship validated in the eyes of the law and the community. Luke and James have campaigned fiercely to make marriage equality a reality since Australia was forced down the unfortunate, unnecessary and expensive route of a non-binding postal survey, and they were absolutely elated with the outcome. Luke said: 'If the marriage amendment bill passes through this place, it will mean that we can get married, we will be equal and our love will be recognised to be legitimate. In the event that the marriage amendment bill does not pass successfully through this place, our fight will not have been for nothing, because we will not stop fighting for equality, as those who have gone before us have done so strongly and bravely. We will continue to fight for what is right and what is just.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's Krys Fischer. In 2007, Krys met the woman who she knew she wanted to spend the rest of her life with. It saddened Krys to know that they did not have the choice to get married like heterosexual couples. When Krys had bad health concerns, her greatest fear was that, if something were to happen to her, her partner was not protected under the law. Krys was fearful that her parents could overturn her partner's decisions and remove her partner from her side. Her partner was the very woman who knew her every wish, and to have her replaced by people who had no idea of her wishes was very distressing. Krys said: 'The passing of this legislation is much more than one day, much more than the wedding itself. This legislation means that we are protected and have the same rights as my sister and her husband. This legislation means my love for the woman who I have loved for 10 years and continue to love will be seen as equal. I thank every person who has had the conversation and fought for equality.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's Jake Farrell. Jake always wanted to settle down in an old Queenslander, get married and have kids, but it always seemed like an impossible dream. In 2009, Jake was a year 9 student and knew he was gay. He spent most of his high school life afraid to accept who he was. He hid it from his family and friends because he feared rejection from those he cared about the most. He became an anxious and depressed young man because he was not like everyone else. However, when he went to university, he finally accepted who he was and began dating. Jake said: 'I did not feel it was wrong. I did not feel ashamed. I felt happy. I felt normal, like everyone else. My relationship felt like everyone else's. We laugh, fight, cry and love. It's about having someone who you love sharing the journey through the ups and downs.' The toughest thing that Jake had to do was come out to his mother. He struggled to tell her for months, unsure of how to bring it up, but, when he did tell her, she simply said, 'It does not change anything, as you are my son, and all I want is to see you happy.' Jake said: 'On the day that 61 per cent of Australians voted, I was proud, because I finally felt that being gay was okay and normal to the vast majority of Australians. Marriage equality means more than just marriage to me; it is acceptance and a feeling that I belong, just like when I first told my mum. It also means that my dream of having a family is one step closer, and one day I'll be able to marry my long-term partner.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I come to our beautiful daughter, Louise. Louise was quite young when she realised that she was gay, but she did not act on her feelings until her early twenties for fear of rejection. She did not talk about it. Like so many teenagers, she kept it to herself and struggled on. As a teenager, Louise suffered with bouts of anxiety and depression, but she masked it very well. I will never forget the day that Louise told me she was gay. It was late in the afternoon. I was in the kitchen tidying the bench and she was hovering around, making small talk—which she normally doesn't—and finally she said that she had something she wanted to tell me. I have a very bad habit of doing many things at once, so I kept working and said, 'Okay, what's up?' She simply said, 'I'm dating someone, and it's a girl.' Well, I certainly stopped what I was doing, and I think I said, 'Are you sure?' And as the words left my mouth, I thought, 'What a dumb thing to say!' But I remember giving her a big hug and saying: 'Louise, you are my daughter, and all I want is for you to be happy. You know that your father, brother, sister and I love you regardless of your sexuality, because it makes absolutely no difference to us at all.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She has always been a very determined, individual young woman, but I know that she has had her struggles and challenges on her journey. Louise has a wonderful partner, Kat, and they are engaged and were to have a commitment ceremony on 14 July next year. Now this can be a wedding. She will be surrounded by family and friends. As a mother, all I have ever wanted for all of my children is for them to be happy, to belong and to be accepted for who they are. Those who know me well know that the only way to really upset me is to attack my children or any member of my family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Louise also has told me that working in the health industry has made her very aware of the legal implications of her relationship not being seen as legally legitimate. Since the results of the survey, Louise said it has made a huge difference to be able to walk down the street holding Kat's hand, knowing that her relationship is seen as equal to that of her brother and sister, who are both married and have children. Louise and Kat feel as though their life has been on hold while they have been waiting and hoping for marriage equality to become a reality, like so many others in the LGBTIQ community. Louise and Kat have attended weddings of three of their friends in the last year, and each time watching each couple declare their love for each other, they had to listen to that one line, 'between a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others'. They found this to be a bittersweet moment each time, because they were so happy for their friends, but also could not help the sadness in their heart, knowing that they were excluded from the same celebration of love. Louise says that it has been difficult living in a loving relationship that has not been acknowledged as equal, because equality is a basic human right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of my family and the LGBTIQ community, I want to thank the people of Herbert for your support. We banded together and fought very hard to get this great result. I would particularly like to thank the tireless efforts of Peter and Steve, the owners of the Sovereign Hotel, a place that has been a refuge for the LGBTIQ community in Townsville for many years. I thank you both for creating a safe place for my daughter to socialise in Townsville when she was younger. I acknowledge the hard work done by Peter Black from Australian Marriage Equality. I thank Cliffo and Loggy from Hit FM, hosts of the morning breakfast show, whose efforts through the media really helped to get the message out to vote yes to support our LGBTI community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, and opposition leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, and all of my colleagues in this place who have supported this bill. I also thank Senator Dean Smith and Warren Entsch, the member for Leichhardt, and his colleagues, who supported this bill under what at times would have been very difficult circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the vote was announced on 15 October 2017, I thought of my friend, Peter Patterson, an incredibly talented man who was severely bashed in a vicious hate crime just because he was gay. The impact of that event sadly ended his life way too early. I thought of long-term friends like Robert and Bill, who have been together for decades, who experienced unjust vandalism on their home simply because they were gay. I remember the bombing of the HIV office in Townsville in the late nineties. But I could also say to myself that Herbert has voted yes. Queensland has voted yes. The nation has voted yes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stand here in this place, I call for unity to support this bill. Now is the time for the hatred to end. Now is the time for the division to end. Now is the time to put aside our differences and accept each other for who we are, because in reality there is much more that we have in common than we have that separates us. It is our differences that make us who we are, and it is the strength through diversity that makes Australia a truly great nation. It's time for this nation to come together to support human rights and equality. It's well overdue. It's time for marriage equality in Australia. It's time to stop treating minorities as second-class citizens. It's time to stop telling the LGBTIQ and gender-diverse community that they're not important and that their needs are less. It's time to legislate for marriage equality for all loving and consensual couples, and it's time for this to happen now. Equality is a fundamental human right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding, I would like to put the Turnbull government on notice because in my community, when we achieve marriage equality, we will put all of our passion and energy into the continued fight to achieve equality for our first-nations people.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  I rise to offer my words on the private member's bill to change the Marriage Act from marriage being defined as a union between a man and a woman to a union between two persons, basically to give legal and equal recognition to same-sex marriage. I represent the electorate of Mallee, a geographical third of the state of Victoria with a fantastic group of fair-minded, hardworking, compassionate Australians. Changing the Marriage Act is a significant question for Australia. It should not be done lightly, as families—indeed, strong families—are the pillar of a strong society. People are right to hold strong convictions, and representing truthfully the values of 100,000 people in the electorate of Mallee is difficult, as is interacting those values with my values, beliefs and considered judgement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My considered judgement is that the government of Australia should at most times stay out of the homes of Australians except in the interest of protecting from violence or offence against individual family members such as abuse of children or violence against a partner. But, apart from that, what happens in your home is your business. This is a fundamental freedom. I think most of the Wimmera Mallee would hold to the view 'live and let live'. It is for this reason that I held to the position that changing the Marriage Act is a society decision, not a government one. Australians elect representatives to parliament to manage the building of infrastructure, defence of our people, creation of an economy that rewards endeavour but cares for the downtrodden and poor, investment in our health system, looking after of our senior Australians and creation of opportunities for our children through education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition took to the 2 July 2016 election a party-room-determined decision that the only way there would be changes to the Marriage Act was if, first, the Australian people had been consulted. In contrast, the Australian Labor Party promised to introduce a bill to change the Marriage Act within the first hundred days of a Labor government. The coalition won the 2016 election, and I have defended vigorously both our obligation to honour our party-room-determined election commitment and the rights of Australian society to decide on the values of Australian society. I will always endeavour to be a man to honour my promise and listen to Australians. In contrast, the Australian Labor Party have tried everything to block Australians' rights to be heard and now try to take credit for a decision that Australians have determined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I gave an undertaking to the people of the Wimmera Mallee that I would uphold their decision on the Marriage Act as determined in the recent postal plebiscite. I feel a sense of duty to do so. The people of the Wimmera Mallee voted 35,795, which is 45.7 per cent 'no', and 42,495, which is 54.5 per cent 'yes'. And the voter turnout was 78,290, which is 78 per cent, which is a significant turnout. Therefore, I feel duty-bound to vote 'yes'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other members of parliament will act according to their own convictions as to their own personal beliefs in contrast to their electorate, and I do not offer advice about or judgement upon how they vote in this chamber. I will pay tribute to the people of the Wimmera Mallee and to the extremely decent manner in which they conducted themselves throughout the period of the postal survey. The Australian Labor Party had such little faith in Australians' ability to think through and discuss complex issues, but I know how decent country people in particular can be, and they have proved me right again. It is a pleasure to represent such people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout this debate I held steadfast to my personal belief that marriage is and should be between a man and a woman. As the people of the Wimmera Mallee have given direction, I shall fulfil my duty and vote 'yes' to changes to the Marriage Act. It is not a position I hold personally, and I shall explain the reasons for my belief here today. I ask for a level of respect for my position because it is held by many millions of Australians who deserve the right to have someone voice their view in this discussion while it takes place on the floor of the parliament. Love between a man and a woman, a woman and a woman, and a man and a man can be as equally real in feelings and emotions. Who you love is a decision for you, but my belief is in upholding the ideal of the family in a world full of people who make mistakes and in a world full of less than perfect people, of whom I am one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is still value in retaining marriage as the covenant for a bond between a man and a woman to raise children. Love is an essential ingredient to the raising of children and, as a foster parent, I am more aware than most that a traditional relationship does not of itself guarantee the loving raising of children. The breakdown of the family unit has caused more children to be exposed to hardship than any other factor in Australian society. Making the lives of families better improves our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not cast judgement upon same-sex couples who are currently raising children. I'm sure your love is deep and enduring, and I wish nothing but the best for you. But I believe there is an essential truth that cannot be replicated without the influence of both a man and a woman in a child's development. A young girl between the ages of zero and five craves the nurturing abilities and closeness of her mother, and between the ages of five and 10 the positive influence of her dad is essential: to tell her she is beautiful and that she is worthwhile and precious in his sight. Fathers, I say to you: the best way to prevent your daughter getting stuck in an abusive relationship later in life is to instil a sense of self-worth in her early. Between the ages of 10 and 14, as her body changes, she needs her mum. Frankly, that's a journey best walked with a woman. Between the ages of 14 and 18, the role of a dad is to take her on a date, open the door for her, teach her how a guy should treat her—with respect—and be a guard from guys who might come knocking, while ensuring that their intentions are pure. For too many, this has not been either their upbringing or their lived experience in their own relationships. I want to pay tribute to the many single parents who have raised amazing and well-balanced children under different circumstances to this; however, nothing is equal to, nothing replicates and nothing replaces the ideal of marriage between a man and a woman and the loving raising of children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, I believe changing the definition of marriage from a union of a man and a woman to the union of two people both weakens this ideal and weakens our society. I will personally find fulfilling my duty to the people of Mallee by voting yes difficult, as I believe this change will rob the future children of Australia for generations to come, but I will fulfil my duty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have publicly expressed my disappointment at the way this particular piece of legislation has been brought into the parliament. I believe the coalition would have been better to draft legislation at the declaration of the result of the postal plebiscite rather than give free passage to a private member's bill. It would have been legislation that gives effect to the Australian people's wishes to change the Marriage Act from a man and a woman to two persons, as well as hold true to the values that the coalition stands for, values such as: freedom to hold and express a view, freedom for parents to have the final oversight as to how their children are educated, freedom of religious belief and expression and discussion of religion, freedom to administer the assets that a religious organisation has, and the freedom to marry who you love.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I hear the argument that existing laws already uphold these freedoms and that this bill is quite specific in the wording of the Marriage Act, there is enough concern among many Australians, and anecdotal examples from other countries around the world that have legislated for same-sex marriage, that adding additional assurances would have been a unifying action. The role of government is to unite Australians, and enhancing the rights of some should always be embraced while giving assurance to the rights of others. The coalition should have been able to do this more effectively than they have, and I will be supporting amendments to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I must add that the Australian Labor Party do not believe in freedom of conscience and at all times in this public discussion have sought to take away the freedoms of Australians. The Labor Party tried to take away the freedom to be heard as determined in a plebiscite, even though plebiscites are a key part of our Constitution and democracy. The Labor Party have taken away the freedom of conscience, as the party machine has directed that there will be no conscience votes on any amendments that may be proposed to this bill in the House of Representatives. I am not a member of parliament who believes in always being critical of the Labor Party. However, history teaches us that a political party that fails to consult with the people and curtails the freedom of expression within its own ranks would be more likely to remove freedom from people, and Australians should be concerned by the conduct of the Australian Labor Party on this particular issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is here that I shall conclude my speech, for I have endeavoured to give voice to the people I represent, those who celebrate the 'yes' vote and look forward to the changes that this parliament will approve shortly and those who have voted 'no' and feel the parliament must hear their concerns. I have also attempted to give voice and be true to the values I hold, as ultimately we must all one day give account for the decisions we make in this place.</span>

                    <a href="8GH" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURNEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:51</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. I rise to speak in support of this bill on behalf of the many, many, many in the LGBTIQ community that have fought for over 40 years for such equality, and for the fellow travellers that have been there to support the community. We have watched and we have been with you for a very long time. This bill and the decision that we will make on this bill have been a long time coming. I really do pay my homage to all of you—for those of you in the parliament, for those of you that have lobbied and for those of you that are watching on television today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have long been a supporter of marriage equality. I have never had a second thought. It seemed to be so obvious to me. My track record in this space is a long one. When I was the Minister for Community Services in New South Wales, I supported gay adoption. Prior to that, a single gay person could adopt, but not a gay couple. I made sure, as Minister for Community Services, that that changed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support marriage equality as someone who has, and has had, loved ones who identify as LGBTIQ. To them, marriage equality would mean so much. I honour these people and, in particular, my late son, Binni. And I support marriage equality as someone who is a member of a community that has experienced great discrimination and injustice and understands what it means to be rejected, understands what intergenerational trauma feels like and what hurt and distress does to you. Just as the 1967 referendum fundamentally transformed the way we talked about, perceive, value and treat Aboriginal Australians, I truly believe that the passage of the marriage equality bill will make a similar positive transformation of our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have seen firsthand the confusion, anxiety and pain that many of our young people experience in dealing with their sexuality. The reality for LGBTIQ Australians should not have to be to hide your sexuality and your gender when accessing services at social community events and at work. That is wrong. They should not have to experience verbal homophobic abuse, and over a quarter report physical homophobic abuse and other types of homophobia, including cyberbullying, graffiti, social exclusion and humiliation. Homophobic bullying of LGBTIQ young people occurs in schools, and that has a profound effect on their wellbeing and their education and how their life continues. We heard so well about that from the member for Herbert.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What marriage equality says to our young people who are anxious about their sexuality is that, whatever you feel, you shouldn't be afraid anymore. You are equal. We embrace you and we love you as a nation. I say to the children of the LGBTIQ couples: be proud, and I'm so sorry that you've had to put up with the pain of the past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am mindful of the fact that there are a range of views in the electorate of Barton, which did return a 'no' vote on the postal survey. And I want to say to the electors of Barton: I respect those views. But you know, and I know, that it was very clear a long time ago, in the lead-up to my election, long before I was elected to the parliament, that I was always going to support marriage equality and that I would vote in favour in this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I did not like the postal survey. It was expensive, divisive and hurtful. But what I found most disgusting about it was that it forced LGBTIQ loved ones to beg for their own civil rights, a truly humiliating and shameful exercise. I think it was particularly hurtful, unethical and in complete contradiction to the principles of the Westminster parliamentary representative democracy to put the question of basic civil and human rights to a popular vote, or a survey, as if it were some kind of reality TV show. I see parallels in the 1967 referendum, and I've spoken about this in the past. But, of course, the 1967 referendum proposition to count Aboriginal people involved an amendment to the Constitution and required constitutional reform. Marriage equality did not require a referendum. It should have been straightforward, and it should have been done a long time ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the most disturbing, disgusting and misleading homophobic political material circulated in the seat of Barton and in several other electorates in the country. We knew this would happen. Medical experts warned us that this would happen. And that's why I was in no way surprised that many of our LGBTIQ Australians reported fear, anxiety and other mental health difficulties during this difficult time. This issue should have been resolved by this parliament. We should have just simply done our jobs as members of parliament. However, we are where we are now. And, by Friday, this country will have equality for our friends in the LGBTIQ community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that many opponents of marriage equality are tied to the notion of traditional marriage being between a man and a woman. To them I would say: I acknowledge that your concerns may feel real to you, but this is not the first time marriage has been redefined, and it will not impact you. It used to be that people of different races couldn't marry each other. Today, they can, and life goes on happily. I know that there are some elements within this parliament who may try to make issues of religious freedom amendments. I join with my colleagues who will support this bill, and we will not entertain those amendments. To that I will say to those elements who desperately try to employ tactics to delay and distract from this debate: you will not be successful. I have a large, diverse religious community in Barton and I love them. If they raise genuine concerns with me, of course, I'll consider those concerns. But what I won't do is engage in delaying tactics from extreme elements of the parliament who are essentially proposing to roll back antidiscrimination measures. I will not vote to remove one form of discrimination to be replaced by another. The world has come a long way since the days of signs saying, 'We will not serve this race or this community.' My vote for marriage equality will not be about popularity; it will be about what is right and what is wrong, what is fair and what is unfair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In political life, and I have been in it for 14 or 15 years now, there are very few opportunities where we vote with our conscience. They are precious moments. And my conscience is this: I have spent my entire life fighting for fairness. I have fought for the rights and welfare of first peoples. I have fought and will continue to fight to close the gap for recognition and for reconciliation. I have fought against government efforts to make it more difficult for residents from non-English-speaking backgrounds to attain Australian citizenship, a proposal which will impact many voters in the electorate of Barton. I have fought against unrelenting attacks on those that need income support and against robo-debt. I have fought about the 55 million unanswered calls and increased wait times in Centrelink. I have fought for the aged, I have fought for our students, I have fought for all Australians with a disability who are finding it difficult to claim support, get jobs and have a life that's valued. I have fought for fairness in education. I have fought for truth for my entire life. I have fought for fairness in health. I will fight for fairness by voting in favour of marriage equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I represent one of the most multicultural electorates in the nation. I note that some media reports suggest that the 'no' vote correlated with the ethnic enclave in suburban Sydney, but I would issue great caution against this interpretation or analysis of the postal survey results. Even if all the voters from non-English-speaking backgrounds in my electorate and in Australia voted no, it would still not account for the entirety of the 'no' vote. So, let's just get a little perspective on these results. I am proud of my electorate. I am proud of the fact that the electorate of Barton is one of the most multiculturally diverse in this country. And they are proud of me. It wasn't this diversity that was the cause for the 'no' vote in Barton. Voters want conviction from us as politicians; they want truth. My conviction, my life and what it stands for is equity, and that means yes to this proposition. It means yes in eloquence; it means yes, and it's heartfelt. It means yes because it is the decent and the right thing to do. It will help us grow up as a nation; it will broaden us as a nation. It would also say to a community that has experienced enormous hurt and enormous discrimination, including legal discrimination, that finally, 'We love you, we embrace you and you are as equal as anyone in Australia.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank all of those involved in finally bringing this to a vote, from both sides of the House, from the upper house and from the lower house, and also those people who have been mentioned in particular by the member for Herbert, who spoke just prior to me. I can't wait for February and March in Sydney; what a great Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras it's going to be in 2018! We will have the eyes of the world on us. The eyes of the world are watching what we are doing now. What we are doing now is making the right decision. We are providing equity, we are providing an embrace, we are providing love and we are righting a great wrong that has been perpetrated in this country for a very long time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are giving people who love each other the right to marry, just like other people do in this country. This is not only a legal right; marriage, of course, is much more than that. It is about how you feel in your heart. It is about a commitment to someone for reasons that are soaring reasons to want to marry. It is also, of course, something that this parliament will be able to hold its head up about from today onwards. And when we take this final vote, despite the ongoing amendments that will come, I know that this chamber and this House will finally do the right thing by the LGBTI community, and that is to say: 'You marry, just like everyone else. You are equal.' I cannot say just how proud I am to be able to be part of a parliament that will finally make the decision that should have been made, as I said, a long time ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reiterate that whilst the electorate of Barton may have voted one way—and, of course, that's been reported—they know what I stand for and I know what the electorate of Barton stands for. Above all, it is not about this issue; it is about the issue of equity and equal treatment, and those two thoughts are what will carry us through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, more than anything else, this debate is about love. It is about finally recognising that love is love, and love is the thing that makes this world go around. Finally, this world will go around properly for all people in Australia, no matter who you are, where you are or what you believe in. There could be no more joyous moment and no prouder moment than the moment that this House will experience when we finally pass this bill in the next 24 to 48 hours—certainly before the end of this week. I am a very proud member of the Labor Party and I am very proud to be able to give my thoughts in this debate. With enormous respect, it's about time.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  Following the recently concluded postal survey, I'm pleased to speak today on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. In keeping with the range of conversations I've had with people across Farrer over the last few months, I expected my electorate to vote yes on this issue. The local survey returned a 55 per cent 'yes' vote. This was very much average when compared to the rest of New South Wales, where 57.8 per cent voted yes, and the nation as a whole, where 61.6 per cent voted yes. The participation rate in Farrer was also similar to the national average, with 77.4 per cent in the electorate taking the opportunity to have their say compared to 79.5 per cent Australia-wide. So in my electorate there was a firm endorsement—not categorical but a reflection that this is an important cause whose time has come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as historic as this moment is as an important moment in time for this parliament, this was not always the case. For many, and for many years, same-sex marriage laws were not a critical issue. 'Get on with what is important,' people might have said. But for a proportion of the community, for those who felt they were being excluded by the current definition of marriage, this is a vital issue. I remember Georgia Henderson from Deniliquin, who asked to meet with me in 2011. Arguing her case passionately, talking about her feeling of feeling excluded within her own country community, Georgia said, 'I don't want to be forced to move somewhere in Sydney just so I can feel normal.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have met several times with Hume Phoenix, based in Albury-Wodonga and led by Toni Johnson. Toni has organised a number of local events, meetings and marches over recent years, and I want to acknowledge her heartfelt and personal efforts on behalf of her local LGBTI community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must also recognise the advocacy of Archdeacon Peter Macleod Miller from Albury's St Matthew's Anglican Church. Father Peter is certainly a man of the cloth, but, much more importantly, he is a campaigner for social justice and equal rights—the rights of the homeless, the rights of refugees and the rights of marginalised members of society who deserve our compassion. Father Peter came to this place in August 2015 to hold a prayer breakfast on this very issue. He was just one of 106 members of the clergy who presented a letter of support for marriage equality. As one of the organisers said that day:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are working to raise up the voices of Christian people and people of faith who believe that relationships ought to be strengthened and supported … And we believe this because of our faith, not in spite of our faith.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I am voting with my conscience and the sentiments of my community, the sentiments my community has endorsed, it is impossible for me to sum up in a few statements what the entire LGBTI community in Farrer must be feeling today. Perhaps the most appropriate reflection takes me to a small town in my electorate, Hay in the New South Wales Riverina, a town on the edge of the outback, home of the Shearer's Hall of Fame with, I think it's fair to say, an image that is blokey and rough and tumble. Next March, Hay will be host to the very first rural gay and lesbian Mardi Gras. This event, I'm told, is set to become the country alternative to the much higher profile Sydney event. The changing face and attitude of places like Hay is why we are here today. One of three local women who are organising the Hay Mardi Gras—which, by the way, would have gone ahead whether the vote result was yes or no—is Kerry Aldred. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I personally am so relieved that the result was in favour of the yes! I have many friends that this survey has affected in far too many ways, so having this win is awesome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stood at the Henty Machinery Field Days for three days in September, I learnt that people had mixed feelings about the postal survey plebiscite process. Some were annoyed that it had come to this, feeling that we as politicians had handballed the problem to the community to give us the answer. Many, however, were thankful to see us following our election commitment. They told me they looked forward to having their say and would be happy to abide by the result even if that result was not what they voted for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision the parliament will take this week is about the future. If there is one powerful reason to vote yes, it is that in every high school, in every university, in every venue where young people gather, whilst there are a range of different views on so many things, on the subject of marriage equality there is almost always only one view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have not yet fully resolved discrimination against the LGBTI community, but we have come a long way in this generation. In 1978, I was completing my ACT year 12 certificate at Dickson College in Canberra. The same year, police arrested 53 people at the first Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade. The Mardi Gras was a planned street festival calling for an end for discrimination against homosexuals in employment and housing, and an end to police harassment. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> published the names of those who were arrested. As a result, many of them lost their friends and lost their jobs. The Mardi Gras was seen by my contemporaries as somewhere between a confused celebration of immorality and an exotic curiosity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1982, I was working as a public servant in Canberra. I made friends with a co-worker who disclosed to me that he was gay. This was highly unusual. I was fortunate because his friendship gave me the gift of understanding the irrelevance of a person's sexual orientation to the intrinsic quality of who they are. That year, Australia saw its first case of AIDS, and gay people, gay men, were most unfairly targeted as being somehow responsible or, indeed, only having themselves to blame if they were stricken with this awful disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1984, I was an air traffic controller at Melbourne and Sydney airports. I would have confidently stated that none of my circle of colleagues or friends were LGBTI. In fact, several were. Tragically, the case of a couple who became sick and died meant that their final months were spent hidden and alone without friends. I wished I could have had the opportunity to reach out a non-judgmental hand of friendship. Society judged—that was the problem—even if as individuals we did not. In that year, my home state of New South Wales finally decriminalised homosexuality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1987, I was working as a shearers' cook in western Queensland when the grim reaper advertisements first hit our screens. The campaign was not meant to fuel negativity towards gay men, but it did. Young people became terrified of AIDS; stories circulated about how easy it was to catch and how rapidly it would spread. The rumour mill was out of control. In rural Australia, gay people went underground.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The unique circumstances of people growing up gay, lesbian and transgender in rural Australia have defined my approach to marriage equality. I have heard too many stories of loneliness, misunderstanding, rejection and, ultimately, tragedy not to know that this legislation will do much to heal the anguish. As every provider of mental health services and support will tell you, acceptance of you and who you are—and your sexuality is a huge part of this—does much to prevent adolescent anxiety and self-harm. As so many young people in regional Australia have described to me, it is just so hard to be LGBTI growing up in a small town where everyone knows everyone and there is no-one to turn to for understanding and support. In future, I know this angst and distress will be calmed by the sheer ordinariness of same-sex marriages in a person's community, in their extended family and in society at large.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has been very clear to me throughout this debate is that those of us who are heterosexual should listen to those of us who are not. Anders Furze is a journalist with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Citizen</span>. He comes from my home town of Albury. He expressed his feelings thus:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I'm privileged enough to move in social circles where overt homophobia is rare, although it does happen. But the thing about coming out in a heterosexual culture is that you don't just say "I'm gay", magically click your gay fingers and suddenly erase the overwhelming shame that comes from living in the closet. The effects of hiding an essential part of who you are can and do flow well into adulthood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When the High Court ruled that the same sex marriage survey could go ahead that shame, which I now realise I had displaced onto other aspects of my life, came rushing back. It's hard to avoid it when every time you turn on the TV or switch on the radio or log onto Twitter or check Facebook or walk past an outdoor billboard or stand on a tram or exist in the world people are debating your sexuality in the background.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Initially I played the game. I entertained semi-sober arguments made by straight acquaintances at the pub. I respectfully argued in Facebook threads for my right to be an equal citizen. I took a deep breath and earnestly braced myself for every conservative think-piece on the issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The realisation gnawed at me for days before I eventually let it come racing in: I'd been playing this game my whole life. I'd been deferring to others on the subject of who I was, respectfully segregating my sexuality in order to more easily navigate heterosexual spaces. Why? So I wouldn't offend people. So I wouldn't offend myself. It was a way of being, I realised, that was slowly eating away at me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the people in my electorate who identify as LGBTI, may I say that you have been heard. To the people in my electorate who voted no: I respect your vote. I appreciate that you have expressed deeply held, often religious, convictions that have nothing to do with the discrimination against or marginalising of same-sex couples. I note that the Prime Minister has appointed Philip Ruddock to examine whether Australian law adequately protects the human rights to religious freedom. This review will report in March next year. I assure all of my constituents who have voted no that I will continue to listen to your genuinely expressed concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, many Australians have had a personal journey when it comes to marriage equality and accepting same-sex marriage. I'm not sure that I would have voted yes 10 years ago. I probably wouldn't have. Five years ago, I might have been ambivalent. Today, for me, a 'yes' vote is the only possibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the many individuals across this country who have patiently, carefully worked so hard for so long to bring about this result. The generosity, acceptance and sense of a fair go that have always been at the heart of the Australian character have been and will continue to be well and truly on display.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  Seldom have so many eyes of the nation has been on this House, on our words and, most importantly, on our actions. I stand here to support the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 on behalf of the LGBTI community, for those who fought in the past, for those who fought today to see equality in the law, for those who suffered stigma and felt ashamed, for those who have passed and will, sadly, never see the sun rise on a day when they are treated equally in the eyes of the law, and for those who shed so many tears of shame and sadness alone and in the dark. Through this parliament, we have the power to turn those tears into joy by our actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also stand here today to support this bill for all the mums and dads, sisters and brothers, friends and extended families of same-sex couples. For many of these, it was not about placards on the street. It was about love and loved ones given a fair go. It was a defining moment in our society where people overwhelmingly voted yes for love, and it is important we acknowledge that, for many of these people, it was a leap of faith. It was a quiet determination to address an inequality that, for many, had seen a dinner table split down the middle. This generation of haves and have-nots was measured not by material success but by a right to marriage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I talked to people in my electorate, the mood was mixed. The majority of people I spoke to were in favour of marriage equality, but many resented the airing of such a personal issue in public. Many felt the glare and focus on something so inherently personal was unjust. While views were mixed on the subject, I struggled to come across anyone who thought it was $122 million well spent. But in the end, the LGBTI community again shone through with a conviction that was best summed up by Magda Szubanski, her passion only outmatched by her class. She was the articulate and dignified voice of the campaign. She spoke up on behalf of both the young queer country kids and the generation that had to suffer through the old laws that criminalised homosexuality. Her message and cause resonated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Corio, 84 per cent of electors decided to have their voice heard, and 68 per cent of those who voted in Corio voted yes. Such an overwhelmingly strong turnout for a voluntary survey showed that compassion, love and fairness runs stronger than fear. But, as Magda put it at the National Press Club, we can't turn our back on those who voted no. If we claim respect and fairness as our pillars, we owe it to our democracy and to the next generation to make people feel comfortable and welcome. After all, we in this House are elected to represent our entire electorate, not just the convenient parts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the course of talking with my community about marriage equality, I have come to appreciate how important it is that we make sure we talk about protecting religious freedoms. This bill is about marriage and is necessarily focused on that, but I'm glad that it does look to religious protections that those with concerns in our community will in turn be glad to see. If this survey sparks an in-depth look at our human rights framework and where religious freedoms fit, that can only be good. This bill is about making sure we extend freedoms, not remove them, and that is the worthy principle to which we should adhere. But ultimately our job now is to keep a clear focus on having this bill passed, for it will herald a transitional change for justice for those who will now be able to fully enjoy the institution of marriage for the first time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have received many happy messages from people about just what this change will mean for them, and I'd like to include just one, from Thomas Marshall, who said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To me, this means that we as a nation are able to put aside our differences and finally legislate on marriage equality and join so many other countries across the globe. It means that the love I have is legitimised and recognised by the state, and when the time comes, I'll be able and ready to marry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That message of unity is one we should carry close to our hearts as we pass this bill, for this is a moment when our country grows. When we embrace difference, we become a bigger society. While on the surface there may be a difference between relationships which are gay and relationships which are straight, their fundamental essence is the same; the value of their love is just as precious; the sincerity of commitment is just as deep; and the families built up around them are just as strong. What we are doing today embraces all of those in our lives that are in same-sex relationships on equal and dignified terms and allows parents and children, nephews and aunts, brothers and sisters to engage in the full familial embrace that so many of us as Australians deeply desire. And so today we celebrate all of those in our lives who are in same-sex relationships and who we love. I celebrate my brother-in-law, Jason, and his partner, Wayne. I celebrate my colleague Penny Wong and her partner, Sophie. I celebrate my dear friend Lidija Ivanovski, who helped me with this speech today, and her wife, Jane. I celebrate my sister Jen and her partner, Sue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we celebrate all these wonderful people in our lives, it is important that we remember that, while it is our words in this House to which people will look, it is ultimately our actions by our vote which they so critically await.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="125865" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr McVEIGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  I welcome this significant opportunity to represent the fine electorate of Groom in this debate on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. We are a very significant part of regional Australia and our voice, like those of other electorates, should be heard here in the national parliament. Our centre of Toowoomba is the second largest inland city in Australia behind this, our national capital, and we are the centre of a significant export-oriented agricultural production region and the centre for education, health and cultural services for southern inland Queensland and northern inland New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many members in this chamber, I have been engaging right across my electorate on this particular issue, not just in recent weeks since the survey result was released but since the federal election of last year, 18 months ago, in relation to the coalition's commitment to ensuring that all Australians would have the opportunity to have their say on the question of same-sex marriage. I have engaged on those issues in Toowoomba, in Pittsworth and Highfields, and in Oakey and various communities in between. Like many, if not all, electorates, we certainly have our share of passionate advocates for either case in relation to the survey. In the case of Groom, that has included a whole range of representatives of the LGBTIQ community that I've met with and spent time with. It also includes, for example, Lyle Shelton, the Managing Director of the Australian Christian Lobby, whose home town is Toowoomba, and also one of his campaign colleagues, Dr David van Gend, the President of the Australian Marriage Forum. Through those consultations, I've heard many personal stories. I've shared in many personal stories of people, of family members and of couples wishing to engage in both sides of this debate. All voices needed to be heard, and that's what the survey has enabled us to achieve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm on the record in my community as one who has supported the traditional definition of marriage. That's based wholly and solely on my own relationship. Thirty years ago this year, my wife, Anita, and I were blessed by the sacrament of marriage in the Catholic cathedral in Townsville, by her late uncle, then Father Michael Putney, later Bishop Michael Putney. In local media, requests right across the community, both publicly and, of course, privately on a number of occasions, about my beliefs—my own stance—have been met with my explanation of my personal story. It's very much my view that my relationship with my wife, Anita, is our business. It's no-one else's business. I recognise that such questions are certainly in the sphere for public debate for us politicians, but, just as my relationship is my business, so are other people's relationships. I don't proselytise about mine to others and I'm so pleased that those whom I've engaged with in discussions about same-sex marriage since my election last year have shown me respect for my relationship, just as I have shown respect for and heard the stories about their relationships, both gay and straight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I respect different views and I recognise that good Australian citizens—peaceful people, philanthropists, business owners, community organisation members and leaders—can be any one of us, in all of our communities across Australia, gay or otherwise. I also reflect that this particular issue has not been the most common issue raised with me as the member for Groom. The more common issues by far include the economy, local jobs, infrastructure, such as the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing, inland rail as it crosses New South Wales into our part of southern Queensland, as you're aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Coulton, telecommunications, Centrelink—and the list goes on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I am so proud of the coalition's commitment, as I said earlier, to ensuring that all Australians had the opportunity to have their say on the question of same-sex marriage. That's certainly been embodied in the comprehensive national survey result just completed, which, of course, returned an emphatic 'yes' result in Queensland.</span>

They had $18 billion in revenue but yet have paid no tax.</span>

These are just disgraceful CUB tactics that this company is forcing upon these workers: wage cuts of 30 to 46 per cent and more; cuts to annual leave; cuts to allowances; cuts to workers' shift loadings; and forced stand-down clauses. These are the kinds of tactics used by these big multinationals, and they're getting away with it in this country because of this Liberal government's failure to crack down on the loopholes that exist within the Fair Work Act.</span>

Stop these sham agreements; legislate to stop them here in this country. Enough is enough: these companies should be made to pay their fair share of tax, made to treat their workers with respect and made to stop using these sham agreements.</span>

Part of the tradition has been to report back to the parliament each year after each of the four contests. Unfortunately, the losing team has to report first and that's why you're hearing from me before you hear from the member for Moreton! I want to warmly and genuinely congratulate my mate, the member for Moreton, on a well-deserved and very convincing win. Well done to his whole team, but especially to the one or two players that Ali Kadri recruited who actually live in Graham's electorate! I also want to make a seriously special mention of the Rohingya players, given the circumstances in Myanmar and Bangladesh.</span>

I also want to thank James, the scorer, and Andrew from St Laurie's, the groundsman, for giving us a pristine field, despite the wet conditions. Both officers put together a really fun day with a much deeper meaning and a much deeper message about getting around with each other in the interests of unity, respect and understanding.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  On 30 October, a lion of the Australian music industry and the Northern Beaches community lost his long battle with illness. Ross Barlow was from the small New South Wales town of Braidwood, but became a citizen of much of the world. During World War II, the Air Force used Braidwood for training runs. On one such run, they flew so low over his house that his mother's prized crystal bowl fell from the shelf. Ross told me years later that her reaction was the scariest thing he got to see during the war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ross graduated from Canberra Grammar and later went into country radio, a profession well-suited to his deep and resonant voice. He became a legend in the Australian music scene, where he discovered and developed some of our most famous musicians, receiving an OAM for his services. His stories were legendary and included his attendance at Elton John's wedding. Later in life, he took on the role of mentoring many leaders on the Northern Beaches. My friend Ross demanded proper behaviour, most highly observed in the service to others. He retired more times than I can think of, but was always called back, leading to yet another tribute dinner. His contribution will be missed, and it is not likely that his shoes will soon or easily be filled.</span>

That cautionary warning is needed because, after the Moreton against Rankin community cricket cup—after Moreton was victorious in that match—I couldn't be prouder of the spirit in which the game was played and I couldn't be prouder of my teammates from the Rohingya community. I did miss Ali Kadri. I would note, for the member for Rankin's benefit, that the score of 105 was actually the first time that a three-figure score has ever been reached in the playing of this annual event. I could talk about the member for Rankin's outfielding—I hope that bruise on your hand heals soon; obviously we can work on your catching next year—but I do note I scored a four, and took a wicket as well. Member for Rankin, I can talk you through some of the finer points of the game down the track!</span>

I look forward to the game next year. I particularly want to thank my teammates: Nurul Mustafa, Shafi Mohammed, Salim Mohammed, Rafique Mohammed, Ismail Mohammed, Afser Nurul, Abdur Rahman, Shafiki Alam, Yousuf Mohammed, Osman Gani, Ribatul Islam, Rezwan Mohammed, Alam Mohammed and Hakim Nurul. Good on you and well done. I look forward to coming back and winning it two years in a row next year.</span>

The 53rd Annual Blackwood Christmas Parade and Fair was held on Friday night. The parade is the second biggest in South Australia and was coordinated by Sam Duluk MP and supported by the Blackwood Lions Club and the Rotary Club of Blackwood. More than 65 local organisations and businesses from across Boothby participated, including the Blackwood and Sturt football clubs, the Sturt and Upper Sturt CFS and SES, Kalyra aged care home, Coromandel Valley Ramblers Cricket Club, the Belair Community Centre, the Southern Hills Girl Guides, the 'Hills to Coast' Scouts, the Blackwood Business Network and the Friends of Shepherds Hill Recreation Park. Congratulations to all who participated in the parade by foot, float, vehicle and, of course, sleigh.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Saturday morning saw the launch of the Blackwood Action Group's Christmas Tree Festival. This is an amazing local event with Christmas trees decorated by local clubs, schools and businesses. There's a town crier to make sure the adults behave and that the children have easy access to Father Christmas. Importantly, all funds raised go to support the BEACON Emergency Relief Service, a local initiative that provides assistance to members of the community who are struggling to make ends meet, and AnglicareSA's Star Bear program, which helps children who have lost loved ones cope with their grief. My very sincere congratulations to the organiser, Pauline Dodd, and her husband, Geoff, the Blackwood Action Group and the 160 volunteers who have done a truly tremendous job for our local community and a great cause.</span>

They are ExxonMobil's workers, and they are absolutely in the fight of their lives. They are in a David and Goliath fight with Exxon—a huge multinational—that, as it has been noted, hasn't paid tax in this country in the last two years. They haven't paid tax, but they think workers can take a 46 per cent pay cut. This is an absolutely outrageous act. They are using sham contracts.</span>

These 200 workers are at the forefront of this fight for the whole of the Australian workforce. If they don't win this fight then this is go to roll out to lots of companies around this country. They are fighting for their families. They are fighting for their future. They're fighting for what is fair. I call on every member of this parliament to get behind these workers, to support them and to send a message across this chamber to those opposite: they need to act to get rid of the loopholes that allow for these sham contracts that are ripping off workers in this country. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  There is a chronic shortage of doctors in country Australia. This is well known and it has been a source of great concern to country communities everywhere. Access to medical professionals and the services they provide is something city people take for granted, but country people know all too well what it's like to go without them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Charles Sturt University aims to help solve this long-running problem by training doctors in the bush for practice in the bush through the Murray Darling Medical School. It plans to quarantine 80 per cent of the places for students from regional, rural and remote areas, because, as Charles Sturt University has shown with its many other courses, students from the country who are trained in the country are far more likely to work in regional Australia after they graduate. The course work at the Murray Darling Medical School would specifically prepare students for future practice in rural communities. It's a model that we know works. It has been successfully implemented by James Cook University in North Queensland. Charles Sturt University is already leading the way in training the next generation of country health professionals. As the lead partner in the Three Rivers University Department of Rural Health, it is training graduates in occupational therapy, radiation services, nursing, physiotherapy, pharmacy, podiatry, para-medicine and social work. In recent years, there has been much work to close the great divide in medical services between the city and country. But, until we solve this long-running problem of getting doctors to practice in the bush, equity in medical services between city and country will remain an elusive dream. The time for the Murray Darling Medical School and equity for rural patients has come.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Last week I was graced in my electorate with a visit by the Prime Minister and his Minister for the Environment and Energy. I thought perhaps they'd come to talk to the local community about the investments we need for jobs growth, or perhaps they'd come to talk about the importance of education and stopping their cuts to schools, TAFE and universities. But, no, they'd come to do a quick doorstop at BlueScope Steel and to use it as a visual background for more of their half-baked energy policy discussion. But the minister, whilst he was there, in an amazing act of cheek, decided to try and align himself with Jimmy Barnes and working-class people. I have to say, he was very promptly slapped down on Twitter by Jimmy Barnes, who made it very clear that his song, his music and his views were in no way to be aligned with the policies of this government. It's not surprising. </span>

They are people who are having their wages slashed and their pay and conditions attacked. They are people who pay more tax—not collectively, individually—than the employer that's trying to do this to them. This afternoon I'll meet with the Transport Workers Union and their workers, who are fighting for safety on the roads. This government will not come into my electorate again and claim to represent working-class people. It's a load of rubbish. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

To date, the process has been less than satisfactory in reaching a resolution. There are many witnesses yet to be interviewed and forensic evidence yet to be collected to establish the facts. I call upon the Electoral Commissioner, and the Australian Electoral Commission, to take the necessary action to thoroughly investigate the serious matter. Fraudulent electoral enrolments must not be condoned or tolerated, irrespective if the persons concerned hold senior office-bearer positions in political parties. I do not raise this very serious matter lightly. If appropriate action is not taken by the Australian Electoral Commission, what precedent does it set for the integrity of our democratic process?</span>

Indeed, Australia's response is grossly inadequate, and while signing up to the Paris Agreement was a good start, if we don't have a serious plan to tackle climate change, then it will be much too little much too late. The only solution is to move as soon as possible to zero net carbon emissions and zero reliance on fossil fuels. That's why I've called on the government and the opposition to commit to both by 2030. Yes, that is a very ambitious target. But now more than ever we need ambition, and now more than ever we need strong leadership. There is simply no alternative.</span>

That's why I have been working hard to improve job opportunities for people in Canning at all stages of their working lives. Last month, I was pleased to open the Mandurah Regional Trades Skills Centre at Coodanup Community College. This centre was made possible with a $3.3 million grant from the federal government. This centre is a vocational education hub where students prepare for trades in painting, plumbing, building and gas fitting. Ready access to vocational training is vital to help more young people secure good jobs. This centre is about backing the next generation of Mandurah tradies and small business owners.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those at a different stage in their careers, the Stronger Transitions Package is welcome news. This $10.3 million fund will assist Mandurah workers, who are facing retrenchment, find new jobs. I'm proud the government is backing workers in Canning, through what is a difficult time in anyone's working life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is also helping local businesses like Segnut, which received a federal government grant of $519,000 to commercialise their product. Segnut is a new nut designed by Mandurah innovator Brian Bradshaw that enables the removal of bolts in a fraction of the time. It's a game changer for heavy industrial maintenance that is safer for workers and more affordable for business. Smart inventions inject life into our economy. It's important to back local people having a go with new ideas. These announcements are good news for the working people of Canning, and I will continue to fight for their economic security.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Last Friday, St Christopher's Cathedral in Manuka was filled to overflowing as we farewelled a beloved member of the Canberra community, the late Steve Doszpot, who was accorded a state funeral from the ACT government. Steve Doszpot was a gentleman. He was a true gentleman who entered politics to serve, rather than be served. Steve had made a significant contribution to the Canberra community for more than 40 years. He often shared how the experience of escaping communism with his family in the 1950s helped shape his values and his philosophy for public service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His story of arriving as a son of refugees to become a successful businessman and politician is a tribute to the Australian ethos of a fair go. Steve loved sport and, prior to entering the ACT assembly as an MLA, his strong contribution and leadership as president of Soccer Canberra earned him great respect amongst the football community. He also spent time as president of the ACT Olympic Council during the Sydney Olympics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It shows the true mark of the man that he would spend his remaining time advocating for better awareness of liver cancer and better awareness of cancer generally. In his final speech in the assembly, he said: 'It is not for myself that I am asking. My cancer is inoperable. But, in the course of my journey so far, I've become very much aware of how early diagnosis of liver cancer could help save many lives.' Condolences to his wife and his family and friends. Vale, Steve Doszpot.</span>

Thirty years ago, Peter had a serious motorcycle accident which resulted in the loss of his lower leg, along with other serious injuries. This, however, has not stopped him from accomplishing many outstanding achievements. He has held several Australian weightlifting records and won several international medals in the sport. Peter also currently holds two Australian national sport-fishing records. In 1998, he caught a 53-kilo black marlin and, in 2001, a 73-kilo striped marlin. Both records are held in the handline tackle category. He has also recently become a black belt in karate. He's also a qualified marine boat rescue skipper and has qualifications in marine trimming and carpentry and is also a qualified coxswain. He is also a medallist in the sport of dragon boats, which he started as a family sport with his wife, Angela, and two children, Molly and Ben. His wife, Angela, nominated Peter to participate in the upcoming Queen's Baton Relay in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Games, and, Peter having been part of the 2000 Olympic Torch Relay, it is yet another milestone to celebrate for Peter. Peter pays tribute to Angela for her steadfast support. I congratulate Peter on all his achievements and wish him the best.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  A good bank story! I'd like to congratulate the Clovelly Community Bank on 15 years of operation. When the local Commonwealth Bank shut down and closed its doors in the late 1990s, members of the Clovelly community came together and decided to raise awareness and capital to establish the Clovelly Community Bank. They were led by Michael DeNavi, who's been the chairman of the bank for the last 15 years. They letterboxed and doorknocked the suburb to get enough interest from locals to establish the local bank branch. It was opened in 2002 with a manager and four staff. Over the last 15 years of operation, the bank has done nearly $200 million of business and has opened literally thousands of accounts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The branch also gives back to the local community through support for not-for-profit organisations. Over $1 million has been raised for minibuses, community gardens and educational spaces and for organisations like the Coogee Dolphins, the Purple Hearts, Waverley Action for Youth Services, the Junction Neighbourhood Centre, Windgap, and Weave youth services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bank continues to support over a hundred local not-for-profit organisations. Today the bank has eight employees, five full-time and three part-time, all of whom are locals living in our community. And customers often talk about how, when they go into the branch, the staff know you by name. Congratulations to the Clovelly community branch of the Bendigo Bank for 15 years of service to our community.</span>

BAE Systems' lead partner on the Land 400 project, Marand, is in advanced negotiations with Ford Australia to base its Land 400 operations at Ford's site in North Geelong. These include negotiations to acquire part of the historic Ford factory. If BAE wins the $5 billion Land 400 tender to supply and maintain 225 armed combat vehicles to the Australian Army, Marand will bring vehicle manufacturing back to Geelong, producing the turret shell as well as the hull of the AMV35. This is a very significant win for local jobs. I say thank you very much to Marand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast to local Labor MPs—including the member for Corio, who gave up on our city and did not fight for these Land 400 jobs, even when the Victorian government regretfully located its Land 400 bid at Fishermans Bend as a condition of financial support—I did not give up the fight. The member for Corio should really be ashamed that he could not put politics to one side and join me in this fight. I thank my Victorian coalition parliamentary colleagues, who have been such strong advocates for this important project to bring Land 400 to Victoria, Australia's premier manufacturing state.</span>

Amanda Young was an inspiring young woman, possessing many skills and passions, and a much-loved daughter of Barry and Lorraine. Amanda was talented and hardworking in sports, academics and music. She was only two years older than me. Throughout her life, Amanda excelled in competitive sports, and she had a desire to pursue her dream of a future of environmental science.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In October 1997, Amanda attended an intervarsity rowing regatta in Penrith, where she tragically contracted meningococcal disease and died at the tender age of 18. However, Amanda's legacy lives on through the Amanda Young Foundation, which her parents established in 1998 with the aim of reducing deaths in WA from meningococcal disease and supporting survivors of the disease. The foundation is also committed to supporting the development of young people in Western Australia as future leaders.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Presently, the W strain of meningococcal is particularly affecting many Indigenous communities in WA. The strain affects not just the very young but also the elderly. Too many lives have already been lost to the W strain this year in our community. It is very important to encourage vaccination and also to make sure that the vaccine, which has been in short supply and is expensive, is available.</span>

I was privileged to lead the White Ribbon Day March as hundreds of us walked along the pavement at the Redcliffe Peninsula, making a stand that violence against women is not to be tolerated. I am thankful to have secured the federal government's support of local services in my electorate and would like to thank two organisations for the great work they are doing in this area. I want to thank Encircle for standing up again this year and leading our community in support of White Ribbon Day. I also want to thank Zonta, based in Redcliffe, for their proactive approach in organising projects and activities that promote fellowship, networking and personal development for women.</span>

I want to say to every woman or child that has had to endure the devastating experience of domestic violence: I admire your courage, resilience and commitment to change the story. As you take each step, we walk alongside you and celebrate with you as you move forward into the life that you want and hope for. It's not just me saying this as a male politician, or the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition. In the Good Book, in Ephesians 5, it says:</span>

The Prime Minister has said he has done this as a necessary but regrettable action, but clearly he did not want to do it. He only did it because the banks said he could and gave him permission. Now he's said it will take too long, but if he had set it up two years ago, when Labor called for it, we would already be righting wrongs. We would already be redressing the rip-offs.</span>

Australia's compulsory super is the envy of our world. It is one of the great economic achievements and reforms of the Keating Labor government. Through the Prices and Incomes Accord and through the work of Bill Kelty and Simon Crean, workers were persuaded to give up immediate pay rises to provide for their own retirement. The money that is paid to super funds is deferred wages. This is the workers' money. It belongs to them.</span>

The Turnbull government will invest $4.62 million in seven Western Australian health research projects at Curtin University aimed at improving the lives of Australians. The projects to be undertaken include investigating lower back pain, examining vitamin D deficiency and addressing issues relating to binge drinking—probably well-known within this place.</span>

This funding will support Australia's talented researchers to find solutions to health challenges facing many Australians. The research, to be undertaken at Curtin University, will address public health issues that affect all Australians. Associate Professor Peter Kent will be provided with $1.21 million to lead a project that examines new and innovative treatments of lower back pain. Lower back pain is the leading cause of disability in Australia, with an enormous cost burden for society. Available treatments have resulted in only moderate improvements that typically do not last. This project will investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of two new treatments that have shown promising early results, including an individual movement and cognitive rehabilitation approach, and biofeedback from wireless movement sensors worn on the spine.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:01</span>):  I thank the honourable member for his question. I was pleased to be with him this morning at the launch of White Ribbon Day, where we both made the commitment, yet again, to bring an end to violence against women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not all disrespect of women leads to violence against women, but that is where all violence against women begins. Respect for women must be at the very heart of what it means to be an Australian, and that's why we are taking strong action right now to stop family and domestic violence at the start. Last week, we launched the National Domestic Violence Order Scheme, which ensures that those who breach domestic violence orders from the court will be in breach of the law. We're amending the Family Law Act to stop perpetrators directly cross-examining a victim in family violence matters. We're introducing the Family Law Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill this week to criminalise, as I noted, the breach of personal protection orders issued under the Family Law Act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to paid family and domestic violence leave, the Fair Work Commission recently rejected the ACTU's claim to introduce 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave into all modern awards, but it is still considering the role of unpaid family and domestic violence leave. We respect, as honourable members know, the independence of the commission. We await that decision and we'll consider it very carefully.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, regardless of what the commission decides, Australian men must think about what they can do to advance equality and call out violence whenever they see it. In our roles as fathers, sons, brothers, colleagues, mates and leaders, all of us are capable of saying that that behaviour and that language is not okay when we see someone showing disrespect.</span>

                  </a>  That objection, that point of order from the member from Watson shows how he fundamentally misunderstands the cause of domestic violence. It is disrespect for women. You have got members of the CFMEU threatening domestic violence, and does he condemn it? Oh, no. His leader goes to show his solidarity. Let me say this to you: it's about time the Leader of the Opposition stood up for something. He could stand up for respect for women. He could stand up for Australia. He could stand up for the security of our country. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The first responsibility of every government is to keep Australia safe. That is our job. That's our No. 1 priority. And there are many overt security threats: North Korea, Islamist terrorism, violent criminal gangs. But it also means countering the threat posed by foreign interference, by those people or foreign governments who seek to interfere with and influence our political processes and, in so doing, to corrupt our democracy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot allow the sovereignty of Australia to be compromised in this way. It is the responsibility of this government and this parliament. This should not be a partisan issue. This should be one where we all stand and say, 'We will together upgrade our laws to keep our democracy safe.' Surely that is the least we can ask of every member of this parliament.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have announced today and what we'll introduce into the parliament this week are changes to the law relating to foreign donations but above all relating to foreign interference. As I've described with the Attorney-General and the Minister for Finance, we do need changes to the law to ensure that those who seek to lobby and influence public opinion, parliamentary activities and government actions on behalf of foreign interests should be up-front about it. They should be on a register. And those who do so covertly, contrary to our national interest, should be paying a price under the criminal law for that criminal action.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently we have seen Senator Dastyari put at risk the security of our nation. The Labor Party think it's a big joke. They do; they think it's a big joke. They think that it's okay for a Labor senator to take money for himself and then go and change policy—and then go and read out talking points that could have been written in Beijing on the subject of the South China Sea. And then, when he had reason to believe his benefactor, Mr Huang, may have been under surveillance from Australian security services, he rushed to Mr Huang's side to tip him off and make sure that, when they had a chat, it was without any of the phones being nearby.</span>

                  </a>  The Treasurer is a compassionate man, and he knew we should have stopped the member for Watson from going down this line. Yesterday, a photograph was produced of a street scene in Sydney with me and many other people, including Mr Huang. I think it was a Chinese New Year function. Thousands of people were there. And guess who else was there? The Leader of the Opposition! Fair enough. I make no criticism of him being there. Half of Sydney was there. But what I do criticise the Leader of the Opposition for is this: he has belittled and betrayed Australia by leaving Senator Dastyari in the Senate. I'll tell you this: Senator Dastyari sold out Australia. The Labor Party have made themselves the subject of contempt everywhere, and nowhere more so than in China.</span>

I'll tell you what: Senator Dastyari's integrity, and the Labor Party's foreign policy, was pretty cheap; it was pretty easy to acquire—and that is exactly what happened. Labor will be held in contempt. China respects strength. They respect honesty. They expect the Australian government to stand up for Australia's interests and to be frank and honest. And when we differ they expect us to do so honestly, not sell out Australia for a few thousand dollars.</span>

'Oh dear, Senator Dastyari won't get any more chances other than the three or four he's had already,' says the Leader of the Opposition. And what do they do? Nothing. Zero. Senator Dastyari has sold Australia's security interests out. And this man who wants to be Prime Minister of Australia will not move. I'll you why: it's because Senator Dastyari put the Leader of the Opposition in his job, and he's worried that, without him, he won't— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As representatives of Australia and our people, it is our solemn duty to act in the interest of Australia and the Australian people at all times, whether at home or abroad. We should never advocate the interest of a foreign government at the expense of Australia and its people.

According to an article in the Fairfax press, in 2015 Senator Dastyari gave an interview to China Economic Net. He adopted specific terms that, according to two academic Chinese experts, were provided 'from people well-versed in the political ideology of the Chinese Communist Party'. Also, 'He must be speaking from dot points drafted by someone with close links to the Chinese communist party or government', and further, 'If Senator Dastyari used that term, then he is toeing the Chinese Communist Party line.'</span>

I refer to Labor introducing a bill to parliament to ban foreign political donations over a year ago, and I also refer to former Liberal trade minister, Andrew Robb, saying this about Mr Huang: 'He's a man of many dimensions … He's a very thoughtful, cerebral fellow … He's a man who thinks about life and how we can improve it. He's a visionary.' Is this one of the reasons the Prime Minister has delayed banning foreign political donations for over a year? Is Mr Robb's glowing praise of Mr Huang why the Liberal Party is still taking his money? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Prime Minister, what would it take for this parliament to establish a National Integrity Commission? Over the past fortnight, the opposition and the government have been arguing about integrity, transparency and accountability. Will the Prime Minister commit to a National Integrity Commission to investigate and expose corruption and misconduct, particularly in Australia, and would it happen in this term?</span>

Integrity and transparency, as we have been discussing, are absolutely vital to ensure that we maintain and enhance trust in our democratic system. That is exactly why we have announced the reforms in respect of foreign interference and foreign political donations today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is consistently ranked by Transparency International as one of the least corrupt countries in the world, because we have—and I'm sure I speak for all honourable members—zero tolerance of corruption. But what we need to do, of course, is to live up to that, and the test now is with the Labor Party in respect of Senator Dastyari. You don't need an Integrity Commission to tell you that what Senator Dastyari did was wrong. You don't need an Integrity Commission—and I'm not contesting the merits of what the honourable member is saying—to tell you that every day the Leader of the Opposition leaves Senator Dastyari in the Labor caucus is a day the Labor Party demonstrates its unfitness to lead.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of a National Integrity Commission would not necessarily better guarantee protection against corruption. A National Integrity Commission, depending on how it was designed, could add some benefits, but it is something that would need to be considered with great care. Over the years I have been very sceptical about some of these commissions. As we all know, some of them have done better than others. It's been a pretty patchy performance. We have a very robust multi-agency approach, and what we have, of course, is: the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security that has the powers of a royal commission, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity for particular importance, and the AFP's own Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre. We are very focused on ensuring that government governance, whether it's the Public Service, agencies or politicians, is absolutely held to account and there is zero tolerance for corruption.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has recently been a Senate Select Committee on a National Integrity Commission. I notice that it didn't recommend the establishment of one but, nonetheless, its recommendations are being very carefully considered by the government. We absolutely have the same objective: zero corruption and zero tolerance for corruption. We have many agencies that are working on it, and I will always look forward to working with and speaking with the honourable member to see how we can ensure that our zero tolerance for corruption is all better and better carried out into action.</span>

Every member and senator is expected to act in Australia's national interests at all times. The member for Corio, as the shadow minister for defence, obviously gets this. Not long ago on Neil Mitchell's program, on Thursday, 30 November, when being asked about Senator Dastyari's behaviour over the South China Sea, he said, 'There's essentially a bipartisan position in relation to the South China Sea, so obviously I do think a contrary position to that is against the national interest.' So the member for Corio gets it—as he buries his head in his papers!—but not necessarily so much Labor's candidate for Bennelong.</span>

                  </a>  When Senator Dastyari was discovered to have had his personal expenses paid by TOP Education Institute—$1,600, in fact, of his personal expenses paid—the advice of Labor's candidate for Bennelong, Kristina Keneally, to Senator Dastyari was to 'fudge it'. She was asked about it on <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Story</span>. She said: 'I remember asking him, why did you do this? Like, how are you going to explain this? Why did you do this?' And he said, 'Because I didn't want to pay the bill,' to which she said: 'Well, you can't say that. Don't say that.' What did she expect Senator Dastyari to actually say—that the dog ate his homework or that the tram got a flat tyre? She was advising him to do what exactly? Not to tell the truth. That is what Kristina Keneally was advising Senator Dastyari to do. She was advising him to fudge the issue, to come up with some other kind of excuse. She didn't realise the gravity of the situation that Senator Dastyari found himself in. Having had his personal expenses paid, being compromised by a company with links to the Chinese government, he then changed Labor's policy, for which he suffered a sanction, and then he warned another Chinese donor about how to avoid being surveyed by ASIO or any other government agencies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is it about New South Wales Labor that they don't get how to behave, don't get what the boundaries are for members of parliament and putative ministers? Eddie Obeid crowned Kristina Keneally as the Premier of New South Wales. Senator Dastyari anointed the Leader of the Opposition as the leader of the Labor Party. Why couldn't the Leader of the Opposition win a clean fight? Why did he have to have Senator Dastyari rorting the ballot for the ALP leadership? Why were those 50 votes sent from private homes to Senator Dastyari's office? Who voted for those people? There needs to be an investigation into this, and we will not rest until the Leader of the Opposition orders New South Wales Labor to have an investigation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Is the acceptance of $880,000 a year for a part-time job by a former Liberal minister action that would be caught by the Prime Minister's proposed legislation on foreign interference?</span>

As a fellow New South Welshman and Blue, he would understand that we cannot underestimate the importance of the New South Wales economy to the national economy. Under the coalition, half of our economic growth last year was from New South Wales, under the strong leadership of the coalition government in New South Wales and the Turnbull government leadership at a national level. Some 372,000 jobs have been created under the coalition government in New South Wales and, as we know, under this government here, at a national level, we have around 1,000 jobs being created every day. Unemployment in New South Wales is lower than the national average, at just 4.6 per cent. In New South Wales, we have the longest construction boom going in New South Wales history and some $5.6 billion of work happening on New South Wales roads. The New South Wales budget is back in surplus and debt was erased last year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't always that way in New South Wales. This wasn't always the story in New South Wales, because under the Labor government previously it fell to the bottom of the pack as an economy. Across the country, unemployment was above the national average and debt and deficit reigned in New South Wales under successive Labor premiers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition leader thinks that one of the architects of the economic vandalism in New South Wales, Kristina Keneally, should now join the Labor Party ranks here in Canberra as the member for Bennelong. It's bad enough that the Leader of the Opposition's first draft pick in the Senate for New South Wales is Senator Dastyari, who remains his first draft pick for the Senate for New South Wales. It's bad enough someone like that has been caught cheating on his country—metaphorically, between the sheets—and what should happen to Senator Dastyari is he should pack his bags and he should get out of the house and he should never come back. That's what a real Leader of the Opposition would do, with that level of betrayal being shown by Senator Dastyari. It's bad enough, if that's the case, but he has chosen as his first pick in Bennelong someone Eddie Obeid chose to be the Premier of New South Wales. Eddie Obeid, by the way, is now setting up the Berrima prison branch of the Labor Party, along with Ian Macdonald, who is establishing another prison branch of the Labor Party. And I suspect all of those have visiting rights, not only to see them in prison but to go to Eddie Obeid's lodge down there in Thredbo—as the member for Watson will remember. Who they have chosen in Bennelong goes to the heart of why they are such a risk to this country and why the people of Bennelong should reject Kristina Keneally and Labor.</span>

I thank him very much not only for the strong stance that he takes in relation to border protection but also for the very compassionate approach he has towards welcoming people into our country that are deserving of a new start in life. One of the great achievements of this government has been that not only have we been able to stop boats but we have been able to get every child out of detention. Labor put 8,000 children into detention. We have closed 17 detention centres. Labor put 50,000 people on 800 boats, and 1,200 people drowned at sea. Now we've changed all of that policy, and we still have the threat. We know that we've turned back 31 boats over the course of the last couple of years. And the people smugglers just treat these human beings like any other commodity—that is, they trade in drugs, in prostitutes, in tobacco; they take money from innocent men, women and children to go on the boats. The people smugglers couldn't care less whether they make it to our shores or they go to the bottom of the ocean. This side of the parliament will never ever allow the Labor Party again to undo the success that we have had in securing our borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is concerning, when you look at some of the comments made by some of those opposite and some people who would seek to come into this place to represent the Labor Party which are directly designed for that very outcome. If you look at the comments of people like Kristina Keneally in New South Wales at the moment, who wants to be the member for Bennelong and be an influential voice within the Labor Party, she has, on many occasions, spoken out against the success of the government's policies and wants to wind back the policies, which would see the boats recommence.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the people of Bennelong want a government that has control of our borders, that wants to put national security first, that wants to keep our community safe in this country. And we need to call out people like Kristina Keneally because they are dangerous in trying to undo the border protection policies.</span>

                  </a>  Indeed, Mr Speaker. Let me just say this: if you have a look at the words Kristina Keneally has tweeted or that she's said on Sky over a long period of time, it is clear that she is wanting to undo regional processing. She's wanting to undo the turning back of boats where it's safe to do so. It is clear that this Leader of the Opposition barely has control of this policy within the Labor Party. The fact is that Kristina Keneally would be a disaster as the member for Bennelong, just as she was a disaster as the Premier of New South Wales. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

But, having said that, not everybody on the Labor benches is as weak as the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to protecting Australia's security. I saw in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span> on 4 December a quote from an unnamed Labor MP. They must be sitting here today. I wonder who it is. I think I know who it is. I do!

And he's right to say that the Turnbull government is delivering infrastructure all around the country and certainly working closely with the Berejiklian government in New South Wales. For example, there is $412 million going into NorthConnex, $1.5 billion into WestConnex plus a $2 billion concessional loan, and $1.7 billion going into Sydney Metro City &amp; Southwest. And, of course, all of these will benefit the electorate of North Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They'll also benefit the electorate of Bennelong. For example, people travelling along the M2 through the electorate of Bennelong will then have better access using NorthConnex. Of course, as Metro-style services—four minutes, turn up and go—come to stations like Macquarie Park, Macquarie University and North Ryde, that will deliver enormous benefits to the people of Bennelong.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So too will the commitment by the Turnbull government jointly with the Berejiklian government to spend $100 million on a new bus interchange at the Macquarie University station. John Alexander, as the Liberal candidate for Bennelong, has been a very strong champion for that project and for addressing the needs of his electorate, including a reduction in congestion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are some others who are putting their names forward, meekly, to serve the people in Bennelong. One of them, it must be acknowledged, does have a big transport project on her CV—the Sydney Metro—where she spent almost $500 million. That's quite impressive. But, unfortunately, the $500 million was spent to cancel the project. That is the track record of Kristina Keneally, the Labor member—the Labor candidate—and, of course, the former Labor Premier of New South Wales whose distinguished track record when it comes to public transport was to cancel the Sydney Metro.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who said that? That was the Labor candidate, Maxine McKew, the failed Labor candidate for Bennelong, telling the truth in 2010 about the failure of Labor's rail. You cannot trust Labor. You cannot trust Kristina Keneally. But I'll tell you who you can trust: you can trust John Alexander. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Last year, after the government became the first majority government in more than 50 years to lose control of the House, the Prime Minister told Neil Mitchell, 'It won't happen again'. He went on to say, 'It will not happen again'. Since then, it's happened again and again. After losing yet another vote yesterday, can the Prime Minister confirm that his working majority is not a majority and doesn't work?</span>

                  </a>  On 6 September, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'Trust me'. 'Trust me', he said. Who would do that? 'Trust me, Senator Dastyari has learnt that lesson very clearly.' And then, squaring his shoulders, with the determination of a great patriot, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'I've made it crystal clear. I don't expect to see this happen again. He knows he's made a mistake.' Grinding his teeth, with anger and determination: 'On balance, I'm prepared to give him a second chance.' He said, 'I'm prepared, however, to give him a second chance, because I think he can make a contribution to this country'. But the problem was, it wasn't our country! It was somebody else's country. The character test is very simple: can the Leader of the Opposition say that Senator Dastyari has put Australia first? He cannot. And unless he can make the case for Senator Dastyari—which he refuses to make—then Senator Dastyari must go. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The anonymous commentator to Nick McKenzie and James Massola—I quoted a moment ago—is dead right. He should not be in the Senate and he should not be in the Labor Party, and the Leader of the Opposition has got to decide whether he is prepared to stand up for Australia. Everybody else in this place does. Everybody else is, except for him; he is hanging by a thread connected to Senator Dastyari. That is no way to lead and no way to present yourself as the alternative Prime Minister.</span>

                  </a>  The people of Australia who want lower energy prices don't want the juvenile policies put forward by those opposite. They don't want the juveniles in charge; they want the adults in charge. They want the adults in charge who are driving lower prices and a more reliable system by entering into agreements with the LNG suppliers to get gas supplied to Australians before it is exported overseas; passing legislation through this parliament to stop the ability of the networks to game the system—the poles-and-wire companies; getting an agreement with the energy retailers to offer a better deal to millions of Australians, who are saving hundreds of dollars on their power bills; and taking the decisions to invest in major storage projects, like Snowy 2.0 and projects in Queensland and South Australia, which will see us create a more stable system. And, for the first time, the Turnbull government is undertaking the difficult challenge of integrating energy and climate policy through the National Energy Guarantee. It has taken the advice of the experts from the Energy Security Board. It has had modelling undertaken which will show the Australian average household will save about $120 a year and the wholesale electricity price will come down by about 23 per cent. So if you are a big paper manufacturer, you could save some $10 million a year. If you own a large supermarket, you could save more than $400,000 a year. If you are a chemical factory, you could save more than $1.4 million a year. And that is why this policy has been well received, right across the board.</span>

When she was a powerbroker in New South Wales Labor, energy prices went up by 60 per cent between 2006 and 2011. That's not good news for the people of Epping. That's not good news for the people of Eastwood. And we know that the Leader of the Opposition, with his policy of an emissions intensity scheme, will see Australian average households more than $300 worse off. That is the policy being put forward by the Labor Party.</span>

It does take an extraordinary lack of historical knowledge to be suggesting that this government has anything to apologise for when it comes to the rollout of the NBN. When you look at the numbers, the numbers are quite instructive. The numbers are quite instructive. Let's look at the NBN's corporate plan, published in December 2010. In December 2010, when the Prime Minister was either Mr Rudd or Ms Gillard—one or the other—the number of premises that were supposed to be covered by 30 June 2011 was 223,000. What they actually delivered was 10,575. On 30 June 2012, what did these rollout geniuses from Labor deliver when they had promised 496,000? They delivered 95,799. What did they deliver on 30 June 2013, when they had promised 1.7 million? They promised 1.7 million. This wasn't off the cuff, by the way; this was in their business plan. They promised 1.7 million by 30 June 2013, and they delivered 280,000. Now, that is not a high distinction.</span>

What is their plan? We've got no idea what their plan is. Their plan at the last election was that they were going to deliver two million more premises with fibre and not spend an extra dollar. They were going to reinvent the rules of economics. It's a miracle! Magic pudding economics comes to the NBN. You have zero credibility on the NBN.

Last year, my department processed 399 million Medicare claims, totalling $22 billion, which is $4 billion more than when we first came to office. In Bennelong, 88 per cent of those claims are bulk-billed, which is up from 82 per cent when Labor was in office, and 99 per cent of the time they are processed digitally, which means that very rarely does a person ever need to go into a Medicare or Centrelink office. So in Bennelong people are accessing more services, they're getting more bulk-billing and they're doing it more conveniently.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked about alternatives. We all know that the Labor Party cannot be trusted in relation to saying anything about Medicare truthfully. The Labor candidate for Bennelong, Kristina Keneally, is cut from exactly the same cloth, because from day one of her campaign she has been misleading the people of Bennelong about Medicare. First, for example, she condemned the merger of the Eastwood Medicare office with the Ryde service centre. Little did she tell the people of Bennelong that the Labor Party actually started this program. They merged 128 Medicare offices and had plans to merge every single one. The member for Sydney herself stated this in 2010, when she was the human services minister, and I can quote from her press release. She said:</span>

She also claimed that in the last week of September 2017 she was going to have to wait more than an hour at the Ryde service centre. However, little does Kristina Keneally know that we keep very detailed records of the wait times at the service centres, and the average wait time for the particular week in question was only 12 minutes. But I went through every single day. On the first day of the week, on the Monday, there were 307 people who went to that service centre. How many waited for 60 minutes, for an hour? Zero. On Tuesday there were 278 people and zero waited for an hour; on Wednesday, 304 people and zero waited for an hour; on Thursday, 208 people and zero waited for an hour. And on Friday, the last day, 274 people went through the Ryde service centre, and guess how many waited for an hour?</span>

The company have advised me that around 20 per cent of them are not getting a satisfactory performance and that is why they've put the rollout on hold, so the technical issues can be addressed. I can explain to honourable members precisely what is going on. They are going to improve the experience by upgrading physical infrastructure, such as replacing the taps that connect the network to individual premises. Once that has been done for existing customers in areas that are ready for service, NBN will upgrade all remaining rollout areas. They expect that this will delay the further HFC rollout by about six months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What you've got to remember about HFC is that the people on the Telstra HFC network, which is what the NBN is taking over, already have very good broadband; in fact, prior to the NBN's rollout they would have had some of the best fixed-line broadband in the country. So they're not waiting for broadband. They've got good broadband, and the important point the NBN is seeking to ensure is that, as their parts of the network get connected to the NBN, their broadband experience improves. That is what is going on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The savings, obviously, of using the existing HFC network are enormous. That's one of the reasons why. As the minister said a moment ago, the project can be completed six to eight years sooner and about $30 billion more cheaply. HFC is a technology that is used by hundreds of millions of people around the world for high-speed broadband, particularly in North America. There are some technical issues. The NBN is dealing with them and will address them. As I said, the company has said it will delay the connection of HFC customers to NBN by about six months. This is putting customers first. This is not going to prevent the company meeting their completion date by 2020, so they assure us.</span>

She was a great advocate for medical services before she came to parliament—she helped raise funds, through Soroptimist, for medical services in her area—and since coming to parliament she's been a great advocate and champion for the Shoalhaven hospital. Interestingly, every year she's been in parliament she's helped deliver record funding for hospital services in New South Wales and record funding for the Shoalhaven Hospital in New South Wales. Another thing about her, though, is not just her commitment to hospitals in her electorate and in New South Wales but the fact that she has character, honesty and integrity of the highest order.</span>

We also know that that same person has issued another patent lie—a claim that there have been cuts to hospital funding in Bennelong. Each and every year under the coalition government, hospital funding hasn't just gone up in New South Wales; through that process, it has gone up from $220 million to $390 million for the local hospital district in that area. Each year, every year, hospital funding has gone up. Yesterday we heard Kristina Keneally flat-out lie about her own Medicare wait. Today we know that she has flat-out lied about hospital funding in New South Wales and in her own local hospital district. So the lesson at the end of the day is that we are Medi-friends, Labor are Medi-frauds and you cannot trust Kristina Keneally. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  The government has not been advised about what additional cost will be consequent on the delay in the connection of premises to the NBN for customers that are on HFC. The honourable member should be very clear about this: the NBN is currently available to around 6½ million premises across Australia. The 350,000 that it's available to on HFC is, therefore, a little bit more than five per cent of the total. So the rollout is proceeding at the rate of around 40,000, or thereabouts, active connections a week. It is the fastest deployment of a telecommunications network in the country's history.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the NBN Co is doing is moving at this extraordinary pace. It's connecting more people every 10 days than Labor did in six years. It is an outstanding effort. What they're doing with HFC is making sure that customers get a great service. They have identified some technical difficulties, and so they're going to get them right. That's the difference—Labor promised the world, as the minister described, and delivered nothing. Labor promised the world and delivered billions of dollars of wasted investment. We're getting on with the job and connecting and delivering. That's the difference between our government and the failures of the six years of Labor government that preceded us.</span>

He's a hard worker. I'll tell you why he needs to be: his electorate is 731,297 square kilometres. It's a big electorate. If the member for Maranoa's electorate was a country, it would be the 39th-largest country in the world. It is three times the size of your home state of Victoria, Mr Speaker. It's a big electorate. It needs a big member to look after the 23,966 small businesses in Maranoa, and the member gets around. He understands those small businesses' needs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was recently in Maranoa and I visited Dalby, Stanthorpe, Warwick and Roma. They're great towns. They've got great small businesses, like Nicole's Beauty and John Dee Meatworks. They are all fantastic businesses taking advantage of the instant asset write-off and the lowest tax rate since 1940—</span>

                  </a>  1940, member for McMahon! It is 27½ per cent—the lowest the tax rate's been for 77 years. They are taking advantage of the red-tape reduction that the Turnbull government has introduced and taking advantage of Single Touch Payroll. Just last week the Treasurer announced the Small Business Digital Taskforce, headed by Mark Bouris. That's going to be a wonderful task force which is going to provide great outcomes for small businesses right around the country, including in Maranoa.</span>

                  </a>  Labor likes double-faulters. We are entering a wonderful season of tennis and cricket. Certainly when it comes to tennis, Labor is right behind double-faulters. It has got Senator Sam Dastyari. He's certainly a double-faulter—he's faulted a couple of times. He's still over there in the upper house. The member for Maribyrnong should show a bit of fortitude and tell Senator Dastyari he's no longer wanted. But there's another double-faulter that we can't put up with in the economy, certainly the small businesses of Bennelong can't put up with another double-faulter, and that is Kristina Keneally. What we need in Bennelong is somebody who supports tax cuts. What we need in Bennelong is somebody who supports the instant asset write-off, who supports the red-tape reduction, who supports the digital task force—</span>

                </a>  Today, in question time, I asked the Prime Minister if he would support Labor's policy for 10 days of domestic and family violence leave. He used the second half of his answer to deliver an angry rant about the CFMEU and make allegations about my visit to the Oaky mine. As I have already said in this House about that very issue, I do not condone unlawful or disrespectful behaviour, no matter who does it. I was shocked to read those reports and the language is disgusting. But I think it is a sign of how low this Prime Minister has sunk that he uses a question about helping survivors of family violence as a smokescreen for a personal attack and a political attack on me and the unions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  Paul Keating nailed it when it comes this Prime Minister. He nailed it in two words: no judgement. This Prime Minister has not only declared in this place what the High Court would decide on citizenship only a short time ago, which didn't turn out too well, but we saw his repeated refusals to instigate a royal commission into the banks, and then we saw his backflip. Australians feel the impact of this Prime Minister's lack of judgement every day when it comes to his second-rate NBN. Australian consumers and businesses are bearing the brunt of his lack of judgement. They are bearing the brunt of its impact on their everyday lives, its impact on their ability to conduct their businesses and its impact on their children's ability to get an education and their ability to actually participate in the digital economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whenever you hear this Prime Minister bang on about engineering and economics, I have one bit of advice: evacuate the scene—just run. You know that the poor judgement of this Prime Minister has led to the situation we have today of Australia dropping even further in the international rankings for digital capability. You only had to see this Prime Minister's performance, only minutes ago, where he tried to weasel out of the very real fact that he has failed to deliver on his 2013 election promise to give every Australian access to minimum speeds on the NBN by the end of 2016. We're nearly through 2017. We're nearing the first year anniversary of that broken promise. He promised faster and more affordable NBN sooner under his tenure. He has broken every one of those promises. He promised it would be delivered for $29 billion; that's blown out to $50 billion. Complaints have increased 159 per cent under this Prime Minister and his second-rate NBN. And I tell you what, the Prime Minister tried to tell us in some of his answers here today that NBN users are satisfied. They repeatedly say 85 per cent of NBN users are satisfied. I've got news for him: that would fail every pub test in this country. You would not get that past a single pub in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen is the combination of broken promises and bad judgement of this Prime Minister, but few instances encapsulate it more neatly than the debacle of HFC in the multi-technology mess he has created. You just have to look at yesterday's question. Yesterday he answered a question about HFC and he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There are obviously always issues with these technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not what he said before. Just have a look. In March 2015, the Prime Minister said this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">What our approach will enable us to do is deliver on our word, which is to deliver very fast broadband, in this case at extraordinary speeds, fibre equivalent speeds, much sooner, much cheaper and at much lower cost to customers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what he said HFC would do. He also said on 24 August 2015:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… there are massive savings in time and money to be made by incorporating the HFC networks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wrong! He said on 13 March 2015:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">…</span> the use of HFC networks—could save the company four years to complete the project and around $30 billion in costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wrong on every count! Even after he broke his 2013 election promise—the Prime Minister promised that 2.6 million premises would have access to the NBN over HFC by the end of 2016, but only 160,000 premises had access by that time, just seven per cent. That was just seven per cent of his target. The cost of the HFC technology has blown out by 45 per cent. The Prime Minister still won't release HFC cost estimates from his original NBN policy document and, in October this year, the communications minister said the government's second-rate NBN would be, 'The envy of the world.' I don't know what parallel universe that world is in, but it certainly isn't the one that Australians are living in today. And on 27 November—just last week—the NBN announced they'd be delaying the HFC rollout by six to nine months because the network was not delivering a reliable service. Two million homes and businesses across Australia are impacted by this latest delay, including more than 40,000 premises in Bennelong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the Australian taxpayer who is being punished for these latest failures. The government says it doesn't know how much this will cost taxpayers. But previous analysis signed off by the NBN Co board indicates it could be anywhere between $420 million and $790 million if there's a six- to nine-month delay. Just imagine that: half a billion dollars just thrown down the drain because this Prime Minister couldn't be bothered to take the time to make sure the HFC network was fit-for-purpose before it was rolled out. That was bad judgement, and it's costing taxpayers, for this instance alone, half a billion dollars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To add insult to injury, this Prime Minister promised a new level of transparency in the NBN, but have a look at this spin. This spin would put Shane Warne to shame. This is the media release from NBN Co announcing that six- to nine-month delay. I kid you not, this is the heading: 'NBN Co takes customer experience improvement program to new levels'. I don't know what new level that is when the NBN Co boss, Bill Morrow, actually broke the bad news saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Effective immediately we will delay new activations over the HFC network and delay the rollout until we can adjust a number of issues on the network.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So a six- to nine-month delay is apparently 'a new level of customer experience'. It sure is! It's just not a high one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can see that the government are pretty worried about this Bennelong by-election, and they should be. They should be worried. Their candidate, John Alexander, is a nice bloke. I don't mind him. He's a good tennis player; we got elected at the same time. I've got nothing personally against him, but the sad reality is this. He's been in parliament—or he was in parliament—for seven years, and guess how many times he mentioned the NBN in parliament? Just have a guess at a rough number. Eight times. Even then, there was not a single piece of advocacy for his electorate; he was simply mentioning the word. There was not a single piece of advocacy on this issue. But, to be fair, he hasn't had a lot to work with. The message is quite clear from the government that they simply do not care about the customer. This was supposed to be the year of the customer, according to the Minister for Communications. The year's only got a few days left, and customers have been completely and utterly forgotten by the government when it comes to the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's quite clear. If the good residents of Bennelong are satisfied that half a billion dollars of taxpayers' money is set to be lost because of the poor judgement of this Prime Minister, then by all means, please, vote for the Turnbull government. If they're satisfied and not bothered by the fact that this government has broken every single promise it has made on the NBN, by all means, vote Liberal. But, if you live in Bennelong and actually aspire to have broadband treated as an essential public utility—as something that is as integral as sewerage, as electricity and as water—then, please, consider the fact that this government has failed to deliver on its promise to you. It has failed in every single aspect when it comes to its promises and this project. If you want to be able to watch Netflix without the buffering, if you want a first-rate NBN, if you consider that Australia's place in the global digital economy relies on the highest quality connectivity or if you consider that the internet is important for your small business, important for your children and important for your family, then there is only one way that you can vote in this by-election in Bennelong, and that's for Labor.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Urban Infrastructure</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:27</span>):  The shadow minister has told us that she is concerned about the risk to expenditure of the consequence of the recent HFC decision by NBN. She is about as credible a fiscal hawk as the member for Sydney, who claimed to be concerned about the cost of the same-sex marriage survey. The member for Sydney, of course, has spent her entire parliamentary career carefully and diligently watching taxpayers' money like a hawk. She doesn't want a cent spent that doesn't need to be spent. So, too, apparently, the member for Greenway has suddenly become a fiscal hawk, determined to not see one taxpayer cent spent which doesn't need to be spent. She did gloss over the inconvenient fact that the Turnbull government's NBN strategy is motivated by a range of factors, including rolling out the network more quickly, which it is demonstrably doing, and also saving $30 billion compared to the cost of the hopeless and incoherent plan that we inherited from the disorganised rabble on the other side of this House when they skulked out of office in 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at the record of delivery we have seen on the National Broadband Network from the coalition. Let's look at what was in the business plan that was released after we came to government and what was delivered. The business plan said that, by 30 June 2015, there'd be 1,093,000 premises passed by the NBN. The actual number was 1,165,000, so we beat the target of 30 June 2015. By 30 June 2016, the business plan said that the network would pass 2,632,000 premises. The actual number passed was 2,893,000, so in 2016 we again beat the target. By 30 June 2017, the business plan said that there'd be 5,442,000 premises passed. In fact, the actual number was 5,713,000. For three years in a row, we beat the target, which is a stark contrast to what happened when Labor were in charge of this project, when, year after year after year, they missed the target, not just by a bit but dismally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, the coalition has been delivering. You can see the incredulity of Labor. They are just puzzled. They just don't understand why it would be that NBN would say, 'We are concerned about service levels on the HFC, so we are going to pause activations while we fix it.' You could not find something that was more diametrically opposed to Labor's values than saying: 'There is an issue. We want to make sure customers are getting the service we have committed to, so we are going to pause and fix it. We are going to stop and be totally transparent about what we do.' That is because Labor's values are all about the spin, the promise. They don't care about delivery, they have no experience in delivery and they have no capability in delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is instructive to go and look at service class 0. These are premises which are planned to be serviced by fibre but which are not yet serviceable. There are a number that are at service class 0 right now, as there have been for quite a period of time. That's inevitable as you roll out a network. It is instructive to look at the numbers because, at the end of 2016, that number was 2.8 per cent. At the end of 2014, it was 4.2 per cent. We have been bringing it down. It has gone up a little bit recently because of HFC. We will work on it and we will get it down. But it is instructive to look at the percentage that was service class 0 in 2013 because it wasn't 2.8 per cent; it wasn't 17 per cent; it was 31 per cent. Why did that happen? It happened because Labor were desperately trying to present the best story they could, given their abjectly poor performance, and they were determined to roll out as many premises as possible without caring whether they could actually deliver the customer experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side are focused on the customer experience, so focused that when there is an issue which is absolutely capable of resolution, as the company has made perfectly plain, then we pause and we make sure we fix the issue so people get the service standards that they expect. You could not think of an approach which is more puzzling to Labor, which is more at odds with Labor, who just love the press release, love the announcement. They just don't care about the detailed work of delivery and, frankly, they haven't got the skills and capability. The proof of that is not in the rhetoric; the proof of that is in the numbers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me remind the House of what I was pleased to share with the House during question time, when we compared Labor's actual delivery versus planned delivery. In 2011, actual delivery was 10,500 versus a plan where they claimed they were going to do 223,000. It didn't improve by the time they got to 30 June 2013. Labor's plan, developed by Labor under a Labor government, told the world in 2010 what they were going to do in 2013. They said they would have the network passing 1,700,000 premises. They actually passed 283,000. That was a hopeless, hopeless performance. It's no surprise that even objective sources or sources that are not necessarily barrackers for the coalition, such as ABC Fact Check, present an interesting description here. What was it that ABC News had to say in 2016 in an item headed, 'Federal election: NBN promises past and present explained'? In 2009, Mr Rudd promised the NBN would be finished in eight years. Instead, just 154,000 people could access the service when he left office in 2013. The ABC—not consistently, it must be said, barrackers for the coalition—said: 'When Labor was removed from office, the NBN was running well behind its original schedule and was struggling to meet targets.' That's Labor's track record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister has the temerity to talk about broken promises on the NBN. She needs to look in the mirror because the broken promises have come from the Labor Party on the NBN. It is quite instructive if you look at some of the entirely inaccurate things the shadow minister has said publicly. For example, in an interview on ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span> on 24 October this year, she was admittedly under a bit of pressure, under a bit of questioning. In answer to what was actually a very good question, she said, when she was talking about the amount of funding that Labor had committed, 'We always had peak funding of $45 billion.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was her claim. It was totally at odds with the facts. In Labor's NBN corporate plan they committed to $35.9 billion in capital expenditure and peak government equity at $28 billion. When the shadow minister says publicly, 'We always had peak funding of $45 billion,' that is just factually wrong. It is not surprising that she is making factually incorrect statements when you look at how dismal their record is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It brings me to a question—a question which is one of those abiding mysteries. You could search for the answer to this question for a long time. What is Labor's plan for the NBN? What is Labor actually going to do? We have heard the shadow minister telling us indignantly how much she disagrees with what we are doing with the HFC. The shadow minister works hard to give the impression that, if it were up to her, you wouldn't be using the HFC. That's quite interesting when you look at Labor's 2016 election policy document on NBN, which says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Under Labor, the rollout of HFC (PayTV) will continue …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems that the shadow minister has forgotten about that particular election promise in 2016 as she furiously gives the impression that Labor would do something different.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that same interview in October she was asked by ABC interviewer Emma Alberici:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So, if Labor wins the next election what's your intention? Do you go back to an all fibre network?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say the shadow minister's obfuscation, backsliding and general evasion were world class. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's always been our preference for fibre, and to have fibre as deep as possible into the network, Emma.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, after being pressed for a little while, she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is nothing we would want more than to have as much fibre as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But then, finally, she essentially admitted that they're making no commitments—no promises—at all:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Well, our commitment is that we want to see fibre expanded as far as possible. But Emma, the reality is this: we need to be informed by the state of the network as it is, in the event that we are elected at the next election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Bill Shorten has made it very clear that we are not in the business of ripping up copper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the indignation from the shadow minister, there is no plan from Labor. They have got no alternative. But they do have a record track. And so, when the people of Bennelong and the people of Australia look at the choice before them when it comes to the NBN, it is a very stark choice. The coalition has a consistent record of delivery and rollout. Look at what Labor achieved when they were in government. They achieved very little. They have a dismal record and they certainly don't have any plan at all. The choice is very clear. The coalition is delivering the NBN.</span>

He talks about the track record of delivery of the coalition government on the NBN. There has been no delivery that is worth speaking of other than wrecking a national infrastructure project that was visionary in its concept and that was well on its way to servicing this country in the way this country needed for the future. It started from nothing. You build nothing. All you can do is wreck. All you do is wreck. Labor builds; Liberals wreck.</span>

                  </a>  In October 2016 the Prime Minister hailed the coalition's NBN as 'one of the greatest corporate turnarounds in Australia's history'. What an absolute joke. It was one of the greatest infrastructure betrayals that this country has ever seen. It was a great infrastructure project that would have delivered fibre to the premises to 93 per cent of Australians, and he absolutely wrecked it with his multitechnology mix. It was a visionary Labor project that would have looked after the future of economics in this country, education in this country, health care in this country and even the lifestyles of people in the home to watch things like Netflix and streaming services and enjoy modern services in the home. All of it has been put at risk by a coalition second-rate NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the vision of the original NBN to be realised, it requires speed and it requires bandwidth. These are not things that this government can deliver with its second-rate NBN. Nothing illustrates better the way this government has treated the NBN than the fact that it actually bought 15 million metres of copper wire. In the 21st century, with the rest of the world going to fibre to the premises using superfast optic fibre, this government allowed the NBN to go out and purchase 15 million metres of 20th century copper, which is a fraction of the speed for data upload and download. It's an absolute joke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk of what the experts have to say. The minister stands there and says, 'The NBN, under the coalition, is working so well.' Let's look at what the experts have to say. Professor Rodney Tucker, of the University of Melbourne, calls the coalition's NBN an extremely costly disaster. In his paper 'The tragedy of Australia's National Broadband Network', he concludes, 'This situation is nothing short of a national tragedy.' Associate Professor Mark Gregory, of RMIT, says the economic case for the coalition's second-rate NBN 'was nonsense from the outset' and is 'the largest single waste of public funds in Australia's history'. Internet Australia CEO Annie Hurley says:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Lyons, I did a little bit of research on what the constituents have to say. I was flooded with comments from people wanting to have their say in this speech today. In Westbury in my electorate, 25 jobs were in jeopardy at an engineering company. They'd bought land to build a new workshop and they informed Telstra and the NBN of their intention well ahead of time. They built their workshop. NBN Co said after the workshop was built that connection could take between one and two years, as it is a greenfield site. So 25 jobs were at risk. Luckily, Margaret in my office is an absolute gun. She swung into gear and she convinced NBN of the importance of prioritising this connection. That is only one of scores of examples I have got here of people in my electorate and businesses in my electorate who are suffering under this second-rate NBN. This country deserves better.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  The NBN is perhaps the single greatest failure of the previous Labor government in economic policy. The way this project was proposed was an extraordinary act of economic vandalism. To understand that, we have to go back to the genesis of the NBN, Deputy Speaker, because you will recall that back in 2009 the NBN was conceived on a napkin. The project to build a National Broadband Network was conceived without any financial analysis and with brief conversations between the then Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, and the communications minister, Senator Conroy, flying between different cities. They decided to build a National Broadband Network.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Initially, they said that the government investment would be $4.7 billion. There is a problem with that. The problem is that the actual cost of the NBN, as proposed by Labor, is at least $73 billion.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr COLEMAN:</span>
                  </a>  Indeed, the most recent analysis, conducted in 2015, said that the cost of the full rollout of Labor's plan would actually be $74 billion to $84 billion. So $73 billion is actually the low end of Labor's cost of doing this project. It's just an extraordinary thing to say, 'We are going to build an NBN and it's going to cost $4.7 billion,' when it's actually going to cost at least $73 billion. Think about what that means for the absolute economic vandalism of those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They also lack operational skills, as the minister stated before. They are people without experience of running operations or of actually doing things and, as a consequence, when they left government in 2013, 97 per cent of households didn't have access to the NBN, and three per cent did. That's a very small percentage: 97 per cent didn't and three per cent did. They'd spent about $6 billion by that stage—and bear in mind that the whole investment initially was going to be $4.7 billion, because the private sector was supposed to come along and make this huge investment in this wonderful investment opportunity. Those opposite didn't do the maths. They didn't do the numbers. They don't understand these sorts of calculations. And they said: '$4.7 billion. That'll be it. The private sector will come along and look after the rest.' That didn't happen. And the actual cost of this project, as they concede, was well over $70 billion. So this is a really important point that must never be lost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw so many examples, as they set out to build under the Labor NBN model. A Tasmanian bowls club cost more than $86,000 to connect to the NBN—one bowls club, not a whole fleet of them. And four homes and businesses in Ballarat—four; not 400; not 4,000—cost $150,000. That works out at about $37½ thousand each, which is kind of a lot. So they have a complete lack of understanding of how to do things operationally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a better country than that. We need governments that actually plan things properly and do the homework, do the hard yards and invest for the country. That is what we are doing, with 6.8 million premises already crossed by the NBN and 3.2 million active. The project will be completed within a few more years, but at a much lower cost to taxpayers. And those opposite just kind of wave that away, as if it doesn't matter. Well, it actually does matter that, if you are going to spend tens of billions of dollars, you (a) say, 'Is it necessary?' or (b) say that you are not going to spend when in fact you know and the Australian people know that that is absolutely the case. It's not something that can ever be forgotten.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the failure on infrastructure by Labor is something that we see a lot of. We're seeing a lot of it in Sydney. I'm from Sydney. There's a lot of failure in infrastructure from the Labor government in that great state. The Parramatta to Chatswood rail link—so important to the voters in Bennelong—was promised by Labor in 1998. It was going to be delivered by 2006; it wasn't. The North West Rail Link was promised in 1998. It was supposed to be delivered by 2010; it wasn't. The west metro was promised in 2009; it was supposed to be delivered, and it wasn't. The North West Rail Link was supposed to be completed by 2017; it didn't, of course, happen as envisaged. So there is failure by those opposite in the NBN and in infrastructure more generally. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:47</span>):  Those in the electorate of Werriwa in suburbs like West Hoxton, Middleton Grange, Long Point, Prestons and Casula have been waiting for a decent internet connection for over a decade. First, residents in Werriwa were told, 'You can't have ADSL because you live too far from the exchange', or, 'There aren't any ports left'. Then they were told that Telstra was holding off on upgrades to the local area because of the impending rollout of the NBN. Then they were told that the NBN was finally coming soon to their homes. But, now, in December 2017, they discover that they will be waiting at least another six to nine months. I'm beginning to wonder if those opposite just assume that slow commutes and lousy internet speeds in south-western Sydney makes us really patient people. If that is the case, I'm more than happy to dispel that illusion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of my constituents in Hinchinbrook have recently been moved over to the HFC. They have not reported a positive experience at all. A forum I held earlier this year in nearby Greenway Park was over capacity, primarily as a result of people wanting to voice their issues with their new connections. The complaints ranged from poor internet speeds to a lack of information and clear instructions for back-to-base alarms, medical alarms and landline-only services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One constituent in particular, Mr Johnny Multari, has been trying for five months to have the issues with his HFC connection rectified. Mr Multari had an internet connection over the existing Telstra cable network—the same network that the NBN uses for its HFC—and he was advised that his service quality would improve after switching over. He was disappointed, to say the least, when he discovered that his speeds were substantially slower, particularly in the peak, after switching to HFC. He reported the issue and was paid many visits by NBN technicians, who, each time, would examine the line in his premises and confirm that it was a network issue caused by upstream congestion. The technicians also confirmed to him that he wasn't the only household affected in the area and that they would make NBN aware of the issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each time after Mr Multari's issues were reported to the NBN nothing else would happen, as the NBN would mark the issue as resolved and state that the issue was with his service provider and not the network. His sheer frustration with the whole situation was so great that he said he'd rather be reconnected to the older Telstra cable connection until that network switchover date because he would at least have time to find somewhere else to live that had a decent internet connection! That is not a reasonable decision for anyone in Australia to have to make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it isn't just technicians who have been acknowledging the issues with the HFC network for some time. Even providers are aware of the issues. Another of my constituents in Hinchinbrook was recently advised that he was now able to switch over to the new HFC connection. When he asked his service provider, Telstra, about service quality and what he could expect, he was told that his current internet speeds were the best he would get and that when he went over to the HFC it would be a slower connection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How has it taken so long for anyone to acknowledge that the HFC network was a disaster for most households from the start? I would have thought that it was common sense that before inflicting such technology you would check that it actually delivers and improves service quality. The reality is that we are seeing yet again the Liberals' NBN for what it is: a cheap second-rate combination of old technologies cobbled together in a way that not only fails to improve speeds for households but makes the speeds slower.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those other constituents who have waited for any internet, they must now wait longer. I've spoken about residents of Long Point in this place before. They probably feel that they've already served their time, having originally been promised HFC connections back in February. But they continue to wait for any connection and now will wait for another nine months. The minister said in October that the NBN would be the envy of the world. Unfortunately, the corner of that world that my electorate occupies would not agree with that statement, and it seems that the 160 per cent rise in complainants to the Telecommunication Industry Ombudsman in the last financial year shares their frustration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The experience of Werriwa residents is simply not good enough; they deserve much better. Small business can't function; students can't do schoolwork; and pensioners are confused and concerned. The NBN rollout must be improved. Not to do so relegates my constituents to third-rate or fourth-rate services. I'm continuing to push for a better deal for residents in Werriwa.</span>

Just 51,000 people were connected Australia-wide after six years of Labor government. And remember that the NBN was an electoral commitment from Kevin Rudd in 2007. So, in six years: 51,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, by comparison, the NBN connects over 40,000 a week. In Grey—and I'd like to talk about Grey, the electorate I represent, quite a bit here—54,000 have been passed by either the fibre-to-the-premises or the fibre-to-the-node technology; 20,000 are connected; 14,000 have wireless available; 3,800 are connected; and 250 are connected—that's not correct. I have a wrong number there, Mr Deputy Speaker. But the satellite is available to 14,000 and 2,200 have been connected. In fact, 99 per cent of Grey has the NBN available now, as of this day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That underlines the commitment that the Prime Minister made when he was the Minister for Communications when we came to government in 2013. He said: 'We will concentrate on those areas of Australia that have the worst service first. We will connect them first, because they need the help the most.' Grey was certainly in that boat, because we had no NBN connection across the whole electorate, and most of it was served by reasonably poor technology. To come to the satellite service, in September we lifted the data limits for peak times by 50 per cent. We lifted the data available in off-peak periods by 100 per cent; we doubled it. These figures underline just how much we have improved connectivity for those who live within rural Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Normally, federal members' offices attract complaints about things like communications. People, quite rightly, know that these are federal issues. My office is receiving, on average, four complaints a week now, and they are almost always concerning providers, not concerning the network at all. 'People haven't rolled up on time to do their connection' or 'I made an appointment and no-one arrived' or 'They said they'd come back next week and didn't'—those types of complaints. About the technology itself, after an initial flurry, things have settled down very well, so I'm very pleased with our performance. I'm very pleased with the performance of the technologies that have been rolled out in Grey. That includes all of those technologies. Those people are accessing wireless. I'm not on wireless. In fact, my service is satellite. I'm one of those 12,000 who haven't got around to connecting to it yet. I can't get myself home long enough to ring up and tell someone I'm there to be connected. At this stage, I'm still running on a mobile phone signal—something I need to address. One of my staff members, though, is connected to satellite and says she is quite able to watch movies during the week, quite able to access Netflix and very, very happy with the service. Those people who are on wireless are telling me they have a very, very good service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a few towns left to connect up—including the one from which I come, Kimba, which was a late inclusion to the wireless network; they'll be connected in 2018—but 99 per cent of Grey have the NBN available. That is a wonderful endorsement of those comments by the Prime Minister, when he was the communications minister, saying, 'We will address those parts of Australia that have the worst service first.' I thank him and I thank this government for delivering on that commitment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  It's becoming a bit of a habit in this place for us to rise on this side, with great disappointment, to talk about something that is not working again or is a broken promise or a backflip. Here we are talking about the NBN and yet another delay in rollouts of the NBN. The government rose to power promising a cheaper and better NBN. We can go back to the 2013 election, when we remember the now Prime Minister, the then opposition spokesman on communications, on Sky with all the holograms and all the spin, because that's exactly what it was: nothing but spin that was promising a better and cheaper NBN. Both of those promises have not come to fruition. We've seen an absolute blowout in costs and an inferior system and network where it's actually slower than what people had previously. These are the reports that I'm getting in my electorate. There are delays in getting the NBN rolled out in their suburbs and, when it does get rolled out, it is actually slower and not as good as what they used to have. This is a real problem if you're working from home or if you're a student who wants to download your homework or if you are at university. This is a very big problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure my colleagues next to me and behind me—the member for Herbert, the member for Dobell and the member for Macquarie—will have stories to tell about their electorates as well. I get regular complaints from suburbs in my electorate such as Underdale, Flinders Park, Fulham Gardens, Mile End and Marleston, where bits and pieces of the NBN are being rolled out. There are massive delays when it comes to ensuring that appointments are kept, to being able to adjust to the new system and to ensure, for example, that pensioners who have alarms for their own safety do not have them knocked out with nothing in place to ensure that, when they're in an emergency, they are able to be connected. These are things affecting not just my electorate but those all around the country, from what I hear from my colleagues. As I said, we have seen delays and an inferior NBN than what was proposed by the Labor government in 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we fast forward to today, as I said, we have a second-rate copper NBN that drops out, can't keep up with the demands and performs worse than many, many other countries around the world. And it's only a Turnbull government that could waste billions of dollars and make the internet worse. If they'd just listened to us in 2013 when we spoke about fibre to the node to ensure we would have the latest technology, the best technology and the best communication system, an absolute infrastructure benefit to this nation, we wouldn't be in this position today. And it's one thing to talk about the rollouts and how many houses are being done, but what's the point if they don't work? What's the point if we don't have fast downloads? What's the point if a kid can't download the information to put in his homework? What's the point if a university student can't download things from his university to be able to answer the questions? What is the point of having a fast rollout and of getting it done, which we don't anyway?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, Labor's plan for a majority fibre network rollout was a great opportunity for this nation. It was a nation-building moment where we could be right up there with the latest technology. It's great to hear the Prime Minister talking about internet connections and being the super nation when it comes to technologies et cetera, but you've got to invest your money. You've got to be able to look at the latest technology and run with it, not go to an inferior technology. It was an ideological spite back in 2013 and 2016, nothing else. The government knew the Labor plan and what we were proposing was a far better system but, because of politics and spite, they decided to go against it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You always have to look at the backbench over there on the other side while the leaders of those opposite try to sell Australia the dud system that is the NBN. The complaints I get in my electorate every single day via emails or phone calls, the government side would be getting as well. You can see it when they're talking about the NBN. We have slower speeds, we have dropouts, poor connections and a complete service failure, and it has left many pensioners in my electorate without phones.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs WICKS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  I am pleased to speak on this matter of public importance because, while members opposite claim the government hasn't delivered on its commitment to the NBN, the story of my electorate of Robertson on the Central Coast tells a very different story. I want to look at a real-world example of how we can deliver for people and businesses and how that delivery is done by a government such as happened in my electorate. It is clear, when you look at that, that the only broken promises in my electorate were those made by Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are some of the facts. Under the coalition, the NBN, formerly known as NBN Co, has hit every rollout target we have set since coming to government. Compare this to the previous Labor government's record. Three years after the first premise was connected in 2010, the rollout was more than two years behind—so much so that by late 2013, only 51,000 premises were connected, barely 10 per cent more than the original 2010 target. So how can Labor be trusted?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, under this government, we've got a network which is now available to six million premises and will be available to 11 million premises by 2020. When Labor left government, in contrast, barely 50,000 premises around the country were able to connect. In contrast again, the coalition is connecting 35,000 premises a week— that is, 35,000 a week versus 50,000 in six long years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Central Coast, the record is even more stark. In my electorate of Robertson, the latest report shows around 96 per cent of the rollout is complete, of which two-thirds of premises have taken up an NBN service. That is more than 79,000 premises that are ready for service and more than 53,000 connected. In some areas like East Gosford, Green Point, Kincumber, Yattalunga, Koolewong, Point Clare and Tascott, the take-up rate is more than 80 per cent, which is outstanding. Yet, under Labor's last mismanaged rollout, just under 200 premises in the Robertson electorate were connected to the NBN, despite promises that more than 7,300 homes and businesses could connect to it. Who could forget the sight of the former member for Robertson, Deborah O'Neill, pushing a great big button on the Gosford waterfront and claiming that our region was 'open for business' thanks to the NBN? Yet, despite those claims, 90 per cent of the homes and premises in and around Gosford were actually classified service class zero or service class 1, meaning that, despite all of the fanfare and the press release, people couldn't actually connect. It took months and months of frustration and complaints to overcome the multiple challenges for thousands of homes and businesses that were unable to connect despite the promises made by Labor representatives on the Central Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor created this mess and it's taken the coalition government to clean it up and get on with the job. We've recently announced the activation of a fixed wireless tower in Mangrove Mountain which will connect residents to fast, affordable broadband. Fixed wireless serves five per cent of Australians in rural areas, generally outside major towns. It also has the highest satisfaction rating on the NBN and offers speeds of up to 50 megabits per second download and 20 megabits per second upload. The Mangrove Mountain tower will cover more than 170 premises and I'm advised that nearly 20 per cent of premises in central Mangrove and Peats Ridge have already connected in the few months that it's been active. NBN have advised that the Mangrove Mountain tower will provide links to a second site at Kulnura east, then on to a site at Bumble Hill. This will provide the transmission link to other towers, including a site to the south-west at Mangrove Mountain, and also to Wendoree Park and Spencer, which I'm assured are currently in the planning stages. This is great news, in particular for the communities of Spencer and Wendoree Park.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During a public hearing on the Central Coast in August of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, we heard from local community advocates Belinda Repton and Robyn Downham, who have been tireless campaigners on the issue of broadband and improving mobile phone connectivity and reliability. Robyn described Spencer and the lower Hawkesbury River region as 'one of the last frontiers' and pointed out that it's one hour's drive north of Sydney but still they often feel isolated and neglected. Belinda said that, of the 30 families, 21 are business owners who live in the valley and they rely on the internet to conduct their business. The community expressed frustration at some of the uncertainty around the rollout of the NBN, and they had legitimate concerns about the satellite rollout locally. NBN took this on board and assured residents that the fixed wireless solution would be put in place for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This proves that, in contrast to what members opposite are claiming, the coalition government is not only delivering but also listening very carefully and meeting the needs of communities like Spencer. It's very clear that the only broken promises in my electorate are those made by Labor during their last six long years in government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  I rise in this place to say what an absolute mess the former Minister for Communications and now Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has made of the National Broadband Network. The Abbott-Turnbull government has made promise after promise to deliver a faster broadband network to all households, but, as we are now coming to the end of 2017, with households still buffering and an endless string of broken promises, the Australian people have lost all faith in the Turnbull government and their NBN assurances. We heard Malcolm Turnbull promise that everyone would have access—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms O'TOOLE:</span>
                  </a>  Sorry. We heard the Prime Minister promise that everyone would have access to the NBN by the end of 2016. By the end of 2016, over seven million premises were still waiting for access to the NBN. We heard the Prime Minister promise his NBN would be faster and cheaper, yet the reality is he is delivering a second-rate NBN that is slower and more expensive. We heard the Prime Minister promise he would deliver the NBN for $29.5 billion. His multi-technology mess now costs nearly $50 billion. That is a blowout of $20 billion. On 11 October 2016, the Prime Minister hailed the coalition's NBN as one of the greatest corporate turnarounds in Australia's history. If by 'great turnaround' the Prime Minister means backflipping on every NBN promise made to the Australian people, falling short of every target, overseeing soaring complaints and halting the HFC rollout because it doesn't work, then, yes, it truly is one of the most outstanding turnarounds in Australian history. But it clearly isn't something to be proud of.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Friday, 1 December 2017, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Townsville Bulletin</span> reported that the Vietnam Veterans' Federation Townsville Inc. had no internet to communicate with clients or the Department of Veterans' Affairs for over a week. Both their phone and their internet lines were cut off without warning and they were not able to provide services to their clients. The Vietnam Veterans' Federation Townsville Inc's secretary-treasurer, Chris Mills, stated, 'We can't function; we are doing things manually but we cannot finalise anything.' You can only imagine the increased stress this would have placed on the association itself and on its volunteers, not to mention on our veterans. The electorate of Herbert has the largest garrison city in the nation. It is simply unacceptable to have one of our prominent associations cut off without warning.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My office receives reports from constituents regarding NBN issues on a daily basis. Recently I was contacted by a local small business that runs software development. The director of the business stated that they were in a building where 80 per cent of the tenants could connect to the NBN but the other 20 were left in the wind. This building, I might add, had been serviceable since March 2014. As a software development business, you can imagine the significant financial impact this would have on their business, Mr Deputy Speaker. Small businesses in my community are under enough pressure as it is at present. The failings of this government's NBN should not be an additional burden.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is simply not good enough for households and businesses in 2017. Our nation has become a laughing stock on this issue and we are falling behind the rest of the world when we should be leading the world and the nation. Complaints data released by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman for the 2016-17 year reported a 160 per cent surge in NBN complaints. For the first time, the TIO complaints were outpacing the growth in the number of NBN services. Internet complaints are now also the highest source of complaints, surpassing mobile and landline. Australians are frustrated and deeply disappointed with their experience of the NBN. Under this government, it has become the norm to receive slow speeds, dropouts and unreliable services. Issues and complaints are being buck-passed without accountability. Appointments with technicians are being made only to find that no-one turns up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government needs a complete reality check when it comes to the NBN. This appalling record is an incoherent mess. In 2013, the Prime Minister had no HFC in his NBN rollout plan. In 2014, he had 3.2 million HFC premises. In 2015 this increased to four million premises. In 2016 this decreased to 2.8 million premises. In 2017 this increased to 3.1 million. It begs the question: what will it be in 2018? Despite all of this, the government claims that 85 per cent of NBN users are satisfied. This only shows the complete disconnect that this government has with the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the Turnbull government to stop sitting on their hands and to take action. Labor never planned on this second-rate form of NBN, so it is time to stop the blame game. They are responsible for this abysmal disaster that is called the NBN, and it's the responsibility of the current government— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs SUDMALIS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  When a 24-hour period in politics is seen to be a long time, you can understand how five years has fogged the memories of the Labor Party. The NBN was a cardboard-drinks-coaster plan developed in transit between two cities to establish a digital communication initiative for our nation. Talk about a tale of two cities! The NBN was begun without a proper business plan, without proper planning for infrastructure locations and without a rollout schedule.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was begun in pilot locations. Let me explain: one of these was Kiama. In the grandiose vision, the idea was to have underground fibre cable connected to every premise. What a joke! Labor today talks about slight delays to make sure the HFC is properly connected. The initial connection issues in Kiama—and these were legacy issues from the outgoing Labor Party—included the following: a change from underground connection because too much cost was incurred, due to location complications. Whoops! Kiama is built on basalt, one of the hardest rocks to drill. Secondly, there was no planning to negotiate the use of existing power poles, so a second pole was put in place. Whoops—lack of planning! Thirdly, finally—although not the total end—the fibre reached the premises, but if there was more than one phone in a house there was no connection device, let alone if it were a duplex. Then there was complete confusion in connecting aged-care facilities, where hundreds of connections were needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me remind those who sit in opposition: technology glitches are not new. It seems to me that if you have 40,000 premises able to connect per week, there is likely to be a level of hassle that is a great deal more than when you're only connecting 50,000 premises per year. Labor promised the world to Australians connecting to the NBN, insisting that 100 megabits per second was the need for every household. But did they tell you about the cost? Did that ever get mentioned? No; as usual, Labor told us only part of the story. To me, that is dishonesty by deceit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Gilmore it is proposed that 92 per cent of homes will be able to connect to the NBN by the end of next year. My region, due to its complex geography, has a complete mix of technology: fibre to the premises, fibre to the node, fixed wireless towers and satellite connections. The NBN has had to develop another form for regional areas where homes in small clusters are too far from the node and there is an insufficient number of homes to economically build another node. So we'll have fibre to the curb, as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, the minister said that the multi-mix technology is going to be the absolute best one, and I agree. As a result of taking that approach, the NBN will be completed by 2020, six to eight years sooner than would have been the case under the predecessors—that means the Labor Party—and it will also be completed for $30 billion less. I think that's a major asset.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor promised 250,000 Australians they'd be eligible for interim satellite service, but only purchased enough capacity to service 48,000. Woops—bit of a problem there. They criticised the rollout but they can't get their numbers right. The result was a debacle. Consumers experienced severe congestion at peak times, with speeds similar to or worse than dial-up. It was typical Labor overpromising and underdelivering. We also had to fix this situation. Now, more than 81,000 customers across regional and remote Australia receive faster, more affordable and more reliable broadband. Labor claims the NBN would and should have been delivered. The rate of connection delivery under Labor was dismal with only 20 per cent of their estimated connections for their target by June 2013. We've taken a tortoise-shell speed of rollout up to the speed of the rabbit, with more than 6.5 million homes now able to connect. Cheaper, fairer and affordable is the aim, and we're delivering.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—I am pleased to present the Standing Committee on Procedure's report on the provisions related to disorder in the House of Representatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry was sparked by conversations about the general order of the House and some concern regarding the increase in recent parliaments of the number of members ordered to withdraw for one hour for disorderly behaviour. The committee felt that it was timely to reflect on the adequacy of the current disorder provisions and to consider whether alternative or additional sanctions might be warranted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since Federation, the main sanction available to the chair to manage disorderly behaviour has been to 'name' a member, after which the member is suspended from service of the House for a period of time. In practice, however, this sanction is used very occasionally and only in cases of serious misconduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1994, on the recommendation of the former Procedure Committee, the House amended standing orders to enable the Speaker to direct a disorderly member to leave the chamber for one hour. This procedure, provided by standing order 94(a), has proven to be an effective way for the chair to remove a disorderly member on occasions when formal naming and suspension might be inappropriate, excessive or disruptive to the business of the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the adoption of this procedure there has been a decline in the number of members named and suspended in this place. There has also been, over time, a significant increase in the use of standing order 94(a), especially, I should note, during question time. In the current parliament, members have been directed to leave the chamber for one hour on over 260 occasions. On average, that's around three each sitting day. These figures suggest that while standing order 94(a) remains an effective mechanism for quickly removing a source of disorder, it is less effective as a deterrent for disorderly conduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the course of the inquiry, the committee sought to explore whether there might be other options for managing disorder in the House and canvassed a number of similar parliaments to this end. The committee also held a private roundtable to seek the views of members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee found that while a number of alternative mechanisms exist elsewhere, the view of the members was that the current provisions, and an effective Speaker, sufficiently provide for the maintenance of order in the House. Members are concerned that the expansion of sanctions against disorderly behaviour could have serious and unintended consequences, such as impacting on the decisions of the House, or threatening the robust nature of debate in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee feels that this area warrants continued monitoring, to ensure that the House stays informed about trends of disorderly behaviour and whether they may require alternative or additional sanctions in the future. However, at this stage, the committee feels there is neither the need, nor the desire, to change the provisions for managing disorder in the House of Representatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the committee members for their frank and honest participation during the inquiry, as well as the interested members who either tendered submissions or participated in our private roundtable discussion.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  I rise also to speak on the findings of the inquiry into the provisions relating to disorder by the Standing Committee on Procedure. I note the chair's comments and thank him and members of the committee, Ms Butler, Mr Gee, Mr Goodenough, Mr Irons and Ms Ryan. The committee resolved earlier this year, on 30 March, to identify, as we heard, whether the current provisions of the standing orders are adequate or appropriate to maintain the dignity and decorum of the House in which we serve, and also, importantly, to analyse any relevant examples of international or domestic parliaments that may have alternative mechanisms to those currently exercised under standing orders 88 to 96.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this may not be front-page news, how we operate in this chamber does set the tone for the national debate and politics in Australia. The current two-tiered sanction system within the House of Representatives has been in operation, as we heard from the chair, for over two decades, with standing order 94(a) coming into enforcement in 1994 as recommended by the 1986 procedures committee. The principles embodied within the standing orders enable the Speaker to maintain order within the chamber with the implied discretion of the House that comes from the authority of the standing orders themselves. The relatively stable nature of the disorder provisions reflects the intention of the House to maintain order through the Speaker. However, the inclusion of the one-hour exclusion under standing order 94(a), which I have not received—touch wood—reflects the House's desire for a mechanism that could maintain order and minimise disruption without escalating to the more serious sanction of naming the member.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To expand the powers, as we heard, could potentially allow for more effective control of behaviour within the chamber or more flexibility in minimising disruption. However, it could also impinge on the ability of the House to legislate and vote effectively in circumstance where a member may be excluded under any new powers. So the question of whether the standing orders needed clarifying, expanding or supplementing was tested against similar Westminster style parliaments and with members directly. When the committee looked abroad to other Westminster style parliaments, we saw a variety of ways in which parliaments manage disorder. For example, the United Kingdom's House of Commons has diverged into multiple forms of tiered sanctions but still with the common naming for more serious offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, this House has set its own sanctions, and the current two-tiered sanction structure is as a result of that evolution. Having been 23 years now since the introduction of the current standing order 94(a) provision, statistics suggest that its use has either aided in removing the disorder that would have led to a naming or that speakers have potentially controlled disorderly behaviour in a more efficient manner. As we heard, with little support from current members to support a change, the committee recommended and suggested that the current provisions remain unchanged. This is something I support and I know the members of the committee support. I thank the members of the secretariat and once again place on record the work of the chair to make sure we have an effective report this parliament can deal with.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Yet almost five million Australians voted no in the recent plebiscite and their voices should be heard in this chamber …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, above all else, he said that the vote of the people has happened and that this is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the best way because it resolves this matter beyond doubt or quibble.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the simple question of whether the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry, the national result, as we know, was 61.6 per cent yes. The Queensland result, as we know, was 60.7 per cent yes. I want to emphasise to the chamber that the Groom result was 50.8 per cent no and, therefore, 49.2 per cent yes, with an overall participation rate of 80 per cent, or 82,713 persons. As per the results in other electorates, we did see a higher percentage of females responding. The highest percentage participants across the age groups were those aged 65 years and above. All states and territories recorded a majority 'yes' response. One hundred and thirty-three of the 150 federal electorate divisions recorded a majority 'yes' response. Of the 17 that recorded a majority 'no', two are in Victoria, three are in Queensland and 12, predominantly Labor electorates, are in New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not a gambler by nature, nor do I have a crystal ball, but I am someone who knows my electorate. I'm on the record as predicting over recent months that the Groom result would be roughly fifty-fifty, and that's exactly what has happened. I think it's important to focus, in order to put this into context, on other electorates that returned very marginal results. The marginal 'no' electorates included Bennelong in New South Wales and the Liberal seat of Mitchell in New South Wales. The marginal 'yes' electorates included the National seats of Flynn and Hinkler in Queensland and, of course, the Labor seat of Holt in Victoria—a very broad cross-section of regions and parties represented in those regions, indeed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My consultation in Groom since the result of the survey has been quite extensive so as to decipher what is essentially a fifty-fifty result in my electorate—that very small margin of 50.8 per cent no. I've caught up a number of times with Mr Thomas Coyne, a representative of the LGBTIQ community in Toowoomba and the leader of a peaceful march supporting the 'yes' case through our city many weeks ago, and I have met with other LGBTIQ community members and supporters. I have also met with our mayor, Paul Antonio; my own bishop, Bishop Robert McGuckin of the Catholic Diocese of Toowoomba; and other Christian leaders, such as Pastor Casey Wolverton from the Toowoomba Seventh-day Adventist church, Pastor Ken Wootton from the Christian Outreach College, Pastor Andrew Hoey from the Rangeville Community Church, and Pastor Ian Shelton from the Toowoomba Christian Leaders Network, the father of Lyle Shelton.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been clear, throughout all of those consultations with people supporting obviously both the 'yes' and the 'no' cases in the survey, that respect has shone through in our community above all else. I share with the chamber in particular the gracious and insightful comments of Thomas Coyne, when he shared with me his concerns about mental health in the LGBTIQ community, and, at the end of our conversation, shared with me—no prompting whatsoever—that, equally, that may be a concern for people for the 'no' case disaffected by the result. But his important point about the mental welfare of people affected by this survey, particularly in the LGBTIQ community, was well made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The conclusions from all these consultations in my electorate of Groom over these last few weeks I can summarise as follows. All of those that I've consulted—'yes' and 'no' supporters, as I've said—first of all believe that this bill is going to go through. Secondly, we've had feedback that is basically encouraging the House to categorically vote no, in line with those people's personal views or their electorate results. Thirdly, obviously there are some categorical 'yes' supporters who want a 'yes' vote out of this chamber, in line with their personal views and/or the national or Queensland result, in our case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But far greater than anything else has been the feedback in my community in recent weeks regarding an overall desire to ensure the protection of religious freedoms. Pastor Andrew Hoey from the Rangeville Community Church said to me that, sure, in his view, a gate has been opened here with the survey result that he didn't want to see opened, but he wants this House, and representatives such as me, to step in and look at the protections, now that that gate has been opened, for those concerned about religious freedoms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding my contribution here, I stress to those observing from outside the chamber, particularly in my electorate of Groom, that this is just the debate on the second reading of this bill. Many have suggested that the bill as presented includes sufficient religious freedoms. In the next day or two, we will be in a position to consider in detail suggested amendments that are likely to be in line with what many in my electorate want me to consider. They are foreshadowed to be in terms of religious freedoms, freedom of speech and parental choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the national and the Queensland result, and the very close result in Groom—I call it a 50-50 result—and particularly given my discussions across the region in recent weeks with those who have led the charge in the 'yes' and 'no' cases in Groom, I certainly do not wish to frustrate the progress of this bill. But I do state that, whilst not all of the religious freedoms that have been raised with me will be potentially covered in these amendments to be considered to the marriage bill, and while some of them may not even find a home in this bill, I am committed to supporting such amendments, pending their detail when finally discussed in this chamber. I also recognise the specific Ruddock review, early next year, on whether Australian law adequately protects the human right to religious freedom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, whilst we all work through the detail, both in this bill and of course in the outcomes of the Ruddock review in the early months of next year, I support very strongly, above all else, the view that respect for differing positions on the result of the survey on the question of same-sex marriage must be maintained, and that such an approach will ultimately ensure that this is, indeed, a unifying moment for our country.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  This is a big day for love. Despite the years of bigotry and hate, despite the years of violence and lies, despite the ignorance and the fear, love has won. Today we are on the brink of an extraordinary moment in Australian history. In the tale of our nation this will be remembered as the day love won. The resounding 'yes' vote for marriage equality was a moment of which we can all be proud. Australians opened up our arms and embraced our sisters, our brothers and our families. In the face of bigotry and hatred, we reflected back love. To the young boy in the country town who is working out who he is attracted to, or to the young girl who wants to take her girlfriend to the high-school formal, this is for you. This is a message from the nation's highest body that you are equal, you are loved and you are respected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Melbourne, people campaigned for the 'yes' vote with gusto. Hundreds of volunteers knocked on thousands of doors. Greens offices were full of volunteers and supporters making phone calls. Union organisers at the Victorian Trades Hall Council were active everywhere, and thousands of people turned out for massive rallies. In that respect, I particularly want to acknowledge the years of advocacy from Aly Hog, Anthony Wallace and all those at Equal Love, who have been tireless in Melbourne and throughout Victoria in their pursuit of equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And there were countless local actions. In Kensington, around the corner from me, the Kensington Good Karma Network, a Facebook group that covers Kensington and Flemington, got together of their own volition to place a bulk order of rainbow bunting. As a result, as you walk around streets in Kensington, you will find in many places that every second or third house is festooned with decorations of pride and a call for the 'yes' vote. Racecourse Road, Bridge Road, Swan Street, Gertrude Street, Smith Street and Brunswick Street were a sea of rainbow—and many houses, I am proud to say, had posters that my office had sent to everyone in the electorate. Many churches showed their support. The cities of Melbourne, Yarra and Moonee Valley also displayed a strong message of equality. And so did many big businesses, major organisations and big footy clubs like North Melbourne, Collingwood and Richmond. The result of this enormous effort from thousands of people was that the electorate of Melbourne recorded the highest 'yes' vote in the country. I am so proud of the people I am lucky enough to represent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And so, after decades of prejudice and pain, today we take a crucial step in the healing of our nation. Today a wrong will be made right. Finally, our parliament will change our laws to reflect a universal truth: we are all equal. But we wouldn't be here without the collective effort of everyone who has fought for progress. And we must remember that every step towards equality for LGBTIQ Australians has been paid for with pain and sometimes blood—the blood of queer Australians and their allies who took to the streets to stand up for their rights, only to be batted down by batons and fists; the blood of people who were callously murdered for daring to be who they are; and the blood of people tragically spilled by their own hand when the barrage of messages telling them they weren't loved, that they were wrong, became too much for them to bear. It is a tragedy that their innocent blood was spilt. It is an unspeakable tragedy. In their memory, I wish to pause now for a moment's silence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">LGBTIQ Australians have always been part of our community. In a world that so often told them they should not, or do not, exist, their mere existence has required a courage and resilience many of us can only imagine. Perhaps this truth is embodied by the postal plebiscite—the aberration of democracy that this country put the LGBTIQ community through to get here. As if hundreds of years of persecution weren't enough, the LGBTIQ community was forced to tolerate one final humiliation before they and their love could be recognised as equal. In a cruel twist from a weak Prime Minister, the fundamental rights of a minority were decided by the very majority that oppressed them for so long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, thankfully, the people of Australia proved they are better than the obstructionists who have succeeded for far too long in strangling progress in this country. The victory was sweet and it was emphatic, but it came at a price that should never have been paid. I cannot imagine how the last three months have impacted on LGBTIQ people. Our government pinned you down under a microscope to examine your soul, to determine whether or not your love and your relationships were worthy of equality. You were used as a paddle for the Prime Minister to wade through political waters that were too treacherous for him to wade through alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also reflect on how this important step forward for LGBTIQ people cannot be the last step that we take. True equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer people eludes us now, and the unfortunate reality is that it will continue to elude us well after this bill is enshrined in law. So this watershed moment is not the end and it's not the beginning. It is a step on a long, winding path towards justice. In removing discrimination from marriage we must remember that we are only dismantling one part of a system that bombards LGBTIQ people from every angle with a message that they are different and that they are not normal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, on this day, as we look behind us at the journey that we took to arrive at this moment, we should, in part, be ashamed. But, as we look forward, we have an opportunity. We have an opportunity to use the momentum that has been generated in 2017 to fuel the march towards full equality. Today, as parliament finally catches up with the wishes of the people, we have a reason to be optimistic and hopeful about the future. With this hope comes responsibility: the responsibility to get this right—to get this right here in this chamber, because the nation is watching us closely and sizing up whether this place is up to the task they have set for us: whether or not we will finally vanquish the hard-right conservatives who have waged a holy war of bigotry on the LGBTIQ community for so long. They are holy warriors, led by the member for Warringah, insidiously spreading their hate and their fear for far too long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My message to you, the watchful nation, is that the Greens up are to the task you have set for us. We have always been up to that task. Since we entered this place, we have led the charge to remove discrimination from marriage in this country. I am proud that former Greens leader Bob Brown first introduced a bill for marriage equality into the Senate in 2004. I'm proud that one of my first acts as a parliamentarian was to successfully move and have pass through this chamber a motion requiring MPs to consult with their electorates about marriage equality, to understand just how much people had moved on. And I'm also very proud to have introduced the first-ever marriage equality bill into the House of Representatives in 2012.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I must make clear now is that, while the current bill before the House will remove discrimination from marriage, it is still a compromise. This is not the bill the Australian Greens would have introduced if it were just up to us, but it is apparent that this bill, the product of a cross-party process, is one that is capable of winning the support of parliament. I will move several important amendments on behalf of the Greens that reflect those that were moved in the Senate and which seek to ensure that this bill more closely satisfies the promise that this bill claims to fulfil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments, which I will deal with more closely in the consideration in detail stage, make changes to the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 to, amongst other things, retitle it to reflect what this bill is actually about. They will also ensure that religious and other exemptions don't open the door to further discrimination. The amendments will do a number of things, but amongst those things they will remove the section of the bill that restates the section 37 exemptions in the Sex Discrimination Act, which already give religious organisations right of refusal in the provision of goods and services according to their religious beliefs. This is an unnecessary duplication in the bill, as religious organisations already have this right. What we are also concerned about is that by putting those provisions in this bill it might open up the door to a whole stream of new litigation from the very people who have fought this bill coming to fruition in the first place. I hope that I am rendered wrong in due course, but it is important to point out now that we still have some work ahead of us to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will also seek to amend the bill to ensure that we don't exclude or limit the operation of the states and territories in dealing with antidiscrimination laws, to the extent that any law is capable of operating concurrently with this act. If there are states who have taken a more enlightened approach than the Commonwealth, then we should lift up those provisions rather than push them down. But, of course, I say proudly that, in any event, whether or not those amendments get up, this bill will be supported because it is a bill whose time has come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We stand on the shoulders of giants. Every right and every freedom that we enjoy has been won by the struggle and the sacrifice of those who have come before us: the hundreds of thousands who fought and died in the struggle against slavery; the strength and tenacity of working people who won the right to form unions and the eight-hour day; and the bravery and courage of the suffragettes, who gained women the right to vote. But, here in our time, we also have our own heroes. Thank you, Rodney Croome, Ivan Hinton-Teoh, Alex Greenwich, Anna Brown, Felicity Marlowe and countless others who have fought for marriage equality. Thank you also to Shelley Argent, from PFLAG; Peter Furness, founding convenor of Australian Marriage Equality; Dr Sharon Dane, marriage equality researcher; and John Kloprogge, AME volunteer and just.equal board member. I hope that they're in the gallery today. I don't know whether they've made it, but I hope they are. Thank you also to Jason and Adrian Tuazon-McCheyne and to Jac Tomlins and Sarah Nicols—the couples who first filed to have their overseas same-sex marriages recognised in 2003, prompting John Howard to amend the Marriage Act in 2004. It is so fantastic that you are able to join us as we right a wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say thank you to Bob Brown, who first fought in Tasmania and then in this parliament for equality. I want to thank my Senate colleagues for coming here to the chamber to witness this crucial step towards equality and, in particular, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who has fought for marriage equality since the day that she was elected into this parliament a decade ago and worked to make sure we got some real progress during those good days of a power-sharing parliament. Thank you to Senator Janet Rice for being such a powerful leader for change and being willing to share your own story in the cause of that change. Thank you for your humility and your love and your care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Love is universal. Everyone is capable of giving and receiving love. Every culture and language has a word for love. The Chinese philosopher Laozi said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Arabic word for love is Ishq. This is a profound or divine love for a God or for another person. In the ancient poetry of the Sufi, one cannot often distinguish between the love of another person or of God. The Apostle Paul said in the Corinthians:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Love has persevered and, as marriage equality becomes law in Australia and around the world, a new chapter in the story of love is being written, a chapter that will mean that the love of two people will be recognised in law regardless of their gender or sexuality. Love will become truly universal. Many years ago, when first speaking of marriage equality in this place, I said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Love knows no boundaries. It knows no limits. And love knows when it has found its partner. There have been many attempts throughout history to limit love, and all have failed. As we move further into the 21st century, I am confident that attempts to limit love will fail yet again and that full marriage equality will become a reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said that a few years ago. I am so happy now that time has come. Let the bells ring! Let the people sing, 'Love has won!'</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  I thank the member for Moore for allowing me to speak outside of the order that was previously agreed—I do appreciate that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There would be no greater contrast than me speaking immediately after the member for Melbourne. While his electorate had the highest 'yes' vote in the country, mine had the second highest 'no' vote in the country. A few things have astonished me since then—first of all, the number of people who were surprised that that was the case. I have always had the understanding that, in my electorate, the opinion polls are roughly the reverse of what they are nationally. Secondly, I was astonished by the number of people who have said, as a democratic principle, I was obliged to break an election commitment as a result of the postal ballot. It's the first time I've ever heard the breaking of an election commitment being described as a democratic principle, but that's how a number of people have sought to put it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last time this issue was raised in the parliament, I did vote no. Last time this issue was raised in the parliament, I did not speak. In fact, in the many hours of debate we've had on marriage equality, this is the first time I've come to the dispatch box. When we first dealt with a marriage equality bill, there had been a resolution, which the member for Melbourne just referred to in his speech, where we were told, and it was resolved, that we should consult with our electorates and, having consulted, we should vote accordingly. That meant a very different thing in my part of Sydney to what it meant in many parts of Australia. But, after that vote had taken place, we had a discussion within the cabinet room about marriage equality, and different people were putting their views as to why they'd voted particular ways. I've checked with Senator Wong that she's okay with me saying this. I would never give up something that was said in the cabinet room, but, only yesterday, she let me know that she is okay with it being repeated. At the end of that discussion in the cabinet room, where different people had put different views, the discussion was over and we were about to move to the next item on the agenda. In a very soft, gentle but clearly audible voice, Penny just uttered the words, 'Say "black" instead of "gay", and hear how it sounds'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't think of a single sentence that has had a deeper effect on me than the words that Penny Wong said in the cabinet room—'Say "black" instead of "gay", and hear how it sounds'—not only because of the emotion of hearing those words but also because, when you think about my electorate, my part of Sydney does know discrimination. The people in my part of Sydney don't know terribly well the discrimination that this legislation seeks to fix, but they know discrimination. When discrimination on the basis of race is happening, including from some prominent people at the other end of this building, my electorate gets targeted full-on. When there's discrimination against people on the basis of their faith, my electorate gets targeted absolutely. They need someone who will fight discrimination and will win. They don't need someone who will run some sort of argument that some forms of discrimination are okay and others aren't. If I'm going to be true to the needs of my electorate, of my part of Sydney, of my neighbours and of that little three-kilometre circle that I've lived inside all my life, when most of the rest of the people have travelled around the world to be there, they need someone who will fight discrimination fearlessly because, on national polls, the people in my part of Sydney who get discriminated against are never in the majority. So, if I'm willing to defend them as minorities, I can't pick and choose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within my part of Sydney, there are census figures which can't be true. In my suburb of Punchbowl, there are something like 4,000 coupled households and yet only eight identify as same-sex. You look at the statistics around the rest of the country and you think, 'What could that mean?' It means a whole lot of people move out, it means a whole lot of people just don't identify and it also means a lot of people, no doubt, find themselves in terribly unhappy heterosexual relationships. It would manifest itself in a number of ways. But, ultimately, it also means that there are young people in my part of Sydney who, on top of the religious discrimination and on top of the discrimination on the basis of their race and ethnic origin, cop this one too. For heaven's sake, I'm not going to leave them on their own. We can't have a situation where there is a credible argument that says, 'Because you represent a multicultural community, there is a form of discrimination that you must endorse.' I can't be party to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the amendments that have been put forward and that have been flagged: I indicated before any amendments were proposed in any way that I would be opposing them. That includes amendments that the member for Melbourne will put, which will come from one direction, and the amendments that the member for Warringah will put, which come from another. I indicated that I would oppose them for a very simple principle: if this House approves marriage equality in a different form to the Senate we run a very real likelihood that we will get a dispute between the houses, and where we are dealing with conscience votes we have no way of resolving that. If we go through the entire process that the postal ballot was about and we get to the end of this year—after the public have been forced through what they've been forced through and after the affected community have gone through what they've gone through—and we still don't get it done, the Australian people will have every right to be deeply frustrated and sick to death of this place. There will be some amendments that will have a level of merit, I have no doubt, from one side or the other, but to contemplate this not getting done I think is truly unthinkable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also the case that some of the amendments that have been put to me by some people locally, who I deeply respect, are amendments that defend principles which I agree with. They are principles which I do not believe are in the slightest way put at risk by this legislation. This legislation is not the first time that the Marriage Act has presented different definitions to those of the Christian faith, or the Buddhist faith or the Muslim faith. In fact, for the entire history of this act, it has never been an exact match to any form of religious marriage. Therefore, I don't for the life of me see how people will suddenly be able to stop observing their religious beliefs. I don't see how charities will suddenly have a problem when they already have a view of marriage that doesn't match the Marriage Act. I can't for the life of me see how these problems will arise and, therefore, I can only form the view that there are some people, whether they are inside the parliament or without it and have been part of the 'no' lobby, are simply trying to play a game of messaging. I don't see why the parliament should be part of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, if we ended up with a clear question and I thought there was a threat to people being able to preach their religion in their temples, in their synagogues, in their prayer rooms or in their mosques—if I thought that was going to be at threat—then I would support legislation that dealt with that. If there is ever legislation that puts that at threat, I'll be speaking pretty loudly against it. This legislation doesn't; it absolutely doesn't. It is disingenuous for people in this House, who deal with legislation as the core business of what we do, to pretend for a minute that those issues are at threat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have always been conscious of the fact that the forms of discrimination and hate speech that I have dedicated most of my political career to opposing are forms of discrimination I will never experience. I'll never know what it's like to travel on the train and be abused by a stranger for what I wear. I'll never know what it's like to be in the playground and to be pushed around by other kids because of the colour of my skin. Nor will I know in my life what it's like to be considered different from other people, and less than other people, because of who I love. How can I defend the person who gets abused on the train and defend the child in the school playground, and not also defend the person who is discriminated against on the basis of who they love?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate, my part of Sydney, needs someone who can. My part of Sydney needs someone who can fight discrimination fearlessly and win. I'll be voting yes. There will be plenty of people in my electorate who are disappointed by that, but no-one will be surprised and no-one will see it as anything other than me being completely consistent with the person who presented to them and who they chose to elect.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOODENOUGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  As I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, I wish to say that despite my own personal beliefs, respecting the principles of democracy, I will represent the will of the electors in my constituency in respect of the proposition that the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry. However, I have concerns that the proposed legislation does not contain adequate safeguards to protect the freedoms and liberties of a large section of our community. In recent weeks I have received a volume of correspondence from my constituents expressing concerns about their freedoms. This legislation introduces arguably the most significant and radical social change in our nation's history, both in custom and practice, to the traditions of our country, even dating back prior to European settlement, when Indigenous people shared many Western norms relating to gender roles and family structure. The long-established binary nature of marriage is now being challenged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of background, in 2016 I was part of the Liberal-National coalition team which went to the federal election on the platform of giving the Australian people the right to vote on the issue of same-sex marriage via a nationwide compulsory plebiscite intended to ensure maximum participation. However, as events unfolded, the plebiscite enabling legislation was blocked in the Senate on a number of occasions. As events unfolded, members of the coalition party room collectively decided that the Australian marriage law postal survey, conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, was the appropriate course of action. The question posed in the survey was, 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time of the survey, some 16,006,180 Australians were registered on the electoral roll and eligible to vote. The national participation rate was 79.5 per cent, with 12,727,920 responses received. Of these, 7,817,247, representing 61.6 per cent of respondents, voted yes, whilst 4,873, 987, representing 38.4 per cent of respondents, voted no. In my electorate of Moore, there were 100,491 eligible electors on the electoral roll, 83,575 of whom made the effort to vote, representing a participation rate of 83.2 per cent. A total of 56,690 electors voted yes, representing 68 per cent of respondents, whilst 26,690 voted no, representing 32 per cent of responses. It appears there were 195 informal votes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I made a commitment to the electors of Moore that I would carefully consider the survey results in arriving at my decision in parliament. Accordingly, I wish to explain my reasoning. Firstly, the participation rate of 83.2 per cent is relatively high—only slightly lower than the attendance typically recorded at a compulsory federal election. This is a significant contributing factor in my decision to abide by the result. Secondly, the 56,690 electors who voted yes represented more than 50 per cent of eligible electors by 6,444 votes, representing 56 per cent of all eligible electors—a clear, absolute majority. Therefore, respecting the principles of democracy, I am inclined to reflect the will of the electors in my constituency by voting in favour of the proposition that the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry. In doing so, it is contrary to my own personal beliefs, which I have expressed during the debate. Out of respect for the electors of my constituency, I propose to explain the reasons for my beliefs so that they may consider and better understand my reasoning as their elected representative, irrespective of whether we agree or not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that the institution of marriage is predominantly for the purpose of the having and raising of children in a supportive environment by their biological parents. Of course I acknowledge that, in reality, marriage does not always result in children, and that, due to circumstances, children are not always raised by their biological parents nor in a supportive family environment. Traditional marriage is by no means perfect, but I believe, as many Australians do, that it is the best system which our society has, in the vast majority of cases, for raising children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every child is conceived and born of a father and a mother. Every child should have the basic right to be raised by his or her parents, unless there are extenuating circumstances which prevent this. This is a social norm which the government ought to protect. Parents of opposite genders bring unique characteristics and traits, which enrich a child's life with diversity. Where a child is separated from his or her biological father or mother due to unfortunate circumstances, then it is my belief that it is best that the child has access to a father figure and a mother figure to guide him or her to develop into a well-adjusted young adult. What I am saying may be controversial in today's politically correct world. It may be called 'old fashioned'. It may be called 'conservative'. But it represents the family values which a significant proportion of the Australian population believes in, and I have every right to express this point of view without fear of persecution or prosecution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is biologically impossible for a same-sex couple to produce children without the involvement of a third party, a gamete donor or surrogate, using reproductive technology. This arrangement introduces the element of a third person into a marriage relationship and is one of the fundamental reasons for my objection to same-sex marriage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consenting adults have a choice when deciding to enter into a relationship. I believe that the rights of the child in relation to his or her biological father and mother must also be taken into consideration. Is it ethical for government to normalise the separation of a child from his or her biological father or mother, merely by adult choice, without good reason? Children did not get a vote on this issue, yet future generations of children will be among the citizens most heavily impacted by this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Passing this legislation will almost certainly result in consequential amendments to other acts, which will have to be amended in the future by parliament. It is not known how many statutes will require amendment. The budgetary impact of this legislation has not been fully assessed and will almost certainly have consequences for future budgets. In my view, there has not been sufficient debate about the consequential costs to society of making this change. Ultimately, it's the taxpayers of Australia who will bear the cost of this change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having made a commitment to reflect the will of the electors in my constituency, in favour of the proposition that the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry, the question is: what form will the legislation take? The current bill before the House is inadequate without amendments to protect freedom of speech, freedom of religion, parental rights and faith-based charities and organisations from detriment. Celebrants should be afforded religious and conscientious objection protections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members should be mindful that some 4,873,978 Australians, representing 34.8 per cent of respondents, voted no. These Australians deserve the right to hold their views and beliefs and refrain from involvement in same-sex marriage. Reasonable amendments to protect freedom of speech, freedom of religion, parental rights and faith based charities and organisations from detriment are entirely justifiable. The definition of marriage should separately recognise both man-woman marriage and two-person marriage as valid marriages in Australian law. We must maintain our hard-won freedoms to assemble and to speak freely about traditional marriage and family values in our homes and schools. Individuals should have the freedom from being required to express, associate with or endorse a statement of opinion about marriage which is inconsistent with a person's or organisation's genuine religious or conscientious convictions about marriage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Faith based organisations such as charities must not be forced to become politically correct to avoid fines and a loss of charitable status. They should not be the subject of complaints to the Human Rights Commission or other tribunals. The legal action taken against Archbishop Porteous and the Australian Catholic bishops in relation to the booklet about traditional Catholic Church teaching on marriage is an example. Other examples include professionals being denied their registration because of their views. Experiences in Canada, Ireland and Sweden have seen governments restrict freedoms. The Australian Greens have called for an end to the exemption of religious bodies from the operation of antidiscrimination laws. Holding and expressing a traditional view of marriage as being between a man and a woman must not be deemed to be homophobic bigotry. We must prevent government from taking adverse action against people who have a belief in traditional marriage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our multicultural society we must be respectful of the ethnic communities which voted very strongly to retain the existing definition of marriage. The Australian parliament should respect the freedoms of all religions, including the Christian foundation of our nation, and ministers of religion should be free to preach a traditional view of marriage to congregants of their faith. The legislation ought to maintain specific exemptions for religious, educational and medical institutions which allow them to maintain the religious ethos of their respective foundations. Parents should have the right to remove their children from classes where the teaching is inconsistent with their beliefs about marriage, gender or family values.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian censorship system classifies media content according to age-appropriate categories of G, representing suitable for general exhibition; PG for parental guidance recommended; M for mature audiences; MA 15+ for mature audiences, where children under 15 must be accompanied by an adult; and R 18+ for restricted to adults only. If parents are to supervise the content which their children are watching, then it is not unreasonable that they maintain discretion over the content which their children are exposed to in our schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians who voted yes expressed the view that they were happy to let same-sex couples marry as long as it didn't interfere with their lives or impinge on their beliefs, families or rights. Most of these people would be supportive of reasonable and fair-minded amendments to protect these rights. Article 18(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights gives everyone the right to freedom of conscience and religion. The bill in its current form contains inadequate protections for religious freedoms, freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, parental rights and the right to protest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the consideration in detail phase of this bill I will support a series of amendments which seek to protect the freedoms of speech, religion, parental rights and faith based charities and organisations from detriment, which I have just outlined. It is important to include antidetriment provisions to protect individuals and organisations with a genuine traditional marriage belief from being subjected to unfavourable treatment by public authorities because they hold, express or lawfully act on that point of view. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, despite my own personal beliefs, I will respect the principles of democracy and represent the will of the electors of my constituency on the proposition that the legislation should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry, and I will be supporting amendments to this bill which seek to safeguard the rights of Australians who hold a dissenting view.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Cyber Security and Minister for Defence Personnel</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:20</span>):  There are some issues so important to the fabric of society that they should not be decided in this parliament alone. The  issue of marriage, whose origins are first and foremost a religious rite, is fundamental to our society. I remain eternally grateful to my parents for the strong family unit I was brought up in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Marriage is a tradition that recognises the union between two people. On this issue, it was only right for each Australian who wanted to be heard to be given a chance to speak. This was our commitment to Australians at the last election, and it is a commitment that we have fulfilled despite the fact that this process was continually frustrated. The coalition believed we should allow all Australians to have a say on whether the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry. Australians embraced the opportunity to have their say as part of this process. We saw a record number of people update their details on the electoral roll, and nearly 80 per cent of all eligible Australians participated in the survey. In my electorate of Wannon, 81.4 per cent of all eligible voters returned their survey forms to the ABS. Nearly eight million Australians, and around 50,000 of my own constituents, voted yes in the survey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have previously stated, I will be voting in favour of amending the law to allow same-sex couples to marry, in line with the national and local result. I wish all same-sex couples who decide to marry the best of love and happiness. Can I also commend the member for Leichhardt for his steadfast commitment to this issue. He has been a consistent advocate since 2005, when I first came to know him. I would like to thank all the constituents who came to see me during the survey process to advocate for a 'yes' vote and to explain their personal circumstances and why this outcome was important to them. I am not going to single out anyone in particular, but a broad cross-section of the community made representations, including young farmers, parents, students and the local business community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This process has been an affirming experiencing for Australian democracy and the Australian public, who peacefully and respectfully participated in the public debate. Australians can be assured that the process and outcome of the survey was transparent, fair and, most importantly, allowed all Australians to have a say on this important matter of conscience. As Liberals, we understand that these issues are nuanced and that individuals hold a wide range of views for various reasons. As parliamentarians, it is now our responsibility to enact legislation that legalises marriage for same-sex couples but also acknowledges the concerns of the nearly five million people who voted no. Every coalition member and senator has a free vote to give effect to their decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I support the traditional definition of marriage, I gave a commitment before the last election that I would vote in line with the result of the survey and I will honour that commitment. In saying that, I also believe it is incumbent on the parliament to determine the appropriate levels of religious protections as part of implementing this reform to our marriage laws. The survey period and result demonstrated that a majority of Australians supported the legalisation of same-sex marriage. However, the sensible discussion that accompanied the survey also showed a very high level of support for protecting religious freedoms. While it is important to ensure the will of the majority of Australians is respected and same-sex marriage is legalised in a timely fashion, it is equally essential to reassure Australians that their right to their own religious beliefs will be protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As with the 'yes' case, locally, many of my constituents made their views known against same-sex marriage. I thank them for the respectful and courteous way they did this. Australians recognise that the essential liberties of freedom of conscience, freedom of religion and freedom of speech must be protected. I am of the view that any reforms to protect religious freedoms at large should be undertaken carefully, and I welcome the recent appointment of the Hon. Philip Ruddock to lead a review into the legal protections for religious freedom in this country. I also welcome the fact that Mr Ruddock will be assisted by an expert panel, including Emeritus Professor Rosalind Croucher, AM; the Hon. Annabelle Bennett, AO SC; and Father Frank Brennan, SJ AO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Either in this bill before parliament or as appropriate in other federal legislation, it is essential that religious freedoms continue to be protected in Australia. Right now I would urge each member to consider the potential impact of this bill on the millions of Australians who chose to vote no. Their views are not diminished by their loss, and their freedom to hold their views should not be constrained by any law that we may now seek to pass. I urge all parliamentarians in the House to consider the substance and intent of the Paterson-Fawcett amendments. These amendments should be considered on a conscientious basis, rather than from behind parliamentary lines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must ensure that as we provide freedom to one, we do not take it from another. Conscience and the freedom of conscience in our society are sacred. This freedom is fundamental to the freedom of speech, freedom of action and freedom of political expression. For those without faith, it does not mean that freedom of religion is any less a freedom. Our system has established these freedoms on the suffering and sacrifice of many of those who have gone before us. Many Australians have died for these freedoms and we should ensure that as we extend a new freedom, their sacrifices are not forgotten.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a young boy growing up in country Victoria, my grandfather had a portrait of St Thomas More hanging over the desk in the office. It was through my grandfather that I came to learn of his deeds. St Thomas More was a parliamentarian, a lawyer, a loyal servant to his king and a deeply religious, conscientious man. The story of his sacrifice and quiet spiritual devotion is a lesson in morality that we can all benefit from. In reflecting on his faith and his example in public service, we must recognise the need for a robust legal framework that allows people of faith with conscientious objections to same-sex marriage the freedom to thoughtfully and peacefully honour their own faith. Indeed, it is appropriate to reflect on the words of St Thomas More who said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">No man shall be blamed in the maintenance of his own religion</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, while St Thomas More's stance against Henry VIII on the grounds of his religious principles did not prevent the passage of change, he refused to endorse a position contrary to his own beliefs, which ultimately led to his execution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centuries later, no Australian should be persecuted for maintaining their just and conscientious beliefs, as long as they are consistent with our political and civil rights. Those Australians who do not endorse this change should not risk being punished or forced to endorse it. Their beliefs and faiths should be respected in the same way we will expect them to respect this new freedom when it is passed. Protecting religious freedoms do not discount the freedoms of same-sex couples wishing to be married. They enhance the tapestry of Australian society and ensure that institutions, such as churches, charities and individuals feel free to practise their views in an open and tolerant society.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMMOND</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:29</span>):  Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not intend to come close to using my allotted time for the purposes of this debate. For the avoidance of any doubt, I will be voting yes in relation to passing the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two reasons why I won't be using my allotted time. The first is that any contribution that I could make to this debate will not come close to matching the impassioned eloquence of my colleagues whose speeches I have been most privileged to hear: the member for Watson, just before me; the member for Barton, who moved all of us to tears; and the member for Griffith, who I will speak about in a little more detail shortly. Those speeches had such passion and such eloquence that I could not hope to contribute to or enhance that debate. The other reason is that, quite frankly, every minute that I use standing here is a minute longer it will take for this bill to become law, and I do not intend for that to occur on my watch.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to use this opportunity to acknowledge those campaigners who have fought so hard and for so long to simply achieve a just outcome, and that is marriage equality. Firstly, I acknowledge those parliamentarians who were fighting for equality long before I ever contemplated coming to this place. I would like to apply a uniquely Western Australian gloss in relation to that acknowledgement. The first is Brian Greig, a former Australian Democrats senator who stood up in the other place as an openly gay man in his first speech, in 1999, and foreshadowed the long and bitter fight ahead simply in the name of equality and to recognise the equality of the value of relationships, not only in relation to marriage but in many other areas of unfair and unjust sexual discrimination and discrimination based upon gender or sexuality. Brian Greig, we salute you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A former state member for Perth, John Hyde, was one of the first openly gay men in our state parliament. He made his maiden speech in 2001. John, this moment is for you and for all like you and Brian, who fought so hard, for so long, so long ago. That is what we're here for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the current local activists in Perth and in Western Australia, including the WA says YES! team of Emma Gibbens, Paul Benson and all of your tireless volunteers, we salute you. The local PFLAG group were instrumental in securing such a significant vote in Western Australia and, indeed, in my federal electorate of Perth—and I see the federal PFLAG team here in the gallery. We salute you, Shelley Argent, Rodney Croome and the host of other tireless activists working behind the scenes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the parliamentarians both state and federal who fought so hard so for long: it has been an absolute privilege to watch the tireless advocacy of the member for Maribyrnong, our leader; Senator Penny Wong; our deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek; and the member for Griffith, who has fought this fight so many times. It has been a privilege to watch you fiercely and tireless advocate simply in the name of equality. To those on the other side: Senator Dean Smith, we salute you, and we salute the member for Leichhardt. In one of those moments that I will never forget in this place, the member for Griffith being dwarfed by the hug of the member of Leichhardt was unforgettable—horrific perhaps but, nonetheless, an absolutely beautiful thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the campaign itself—I will not use this time to re-prosecute the arguments for or against. Let's just reflect on the result. There was a 63.7 per cent 'yes' vote in Western Australia, over and above the national average of 61.6 per cent who voted yes. In my seat of Perth, I am very proud to say that 71.5 per cent of those who voted proudly voted yes. I would like to take this opportunity to also acknowledge our wonderful local Rainbow Labor branch, who fought tirelessly. To Sonia Gurrin, to Ashley Buck, to Andy Skinner and to all of those members of Rainbow Labor who fought so hard and for so long, this moment, where I stand right now, is for you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, fundamentally, when we come to this place, we cannot separate the personal from the political. I take this opportunity to also reflect on a dearly beloved sister-in-law now passed. Her name was Sharon. She was 42. She fundamentally formed my views in relation to why this should simply be a 'yes' vote. Sharon was gay and she had a partner for 16 years. I could never possibly look Sharon in the eye and tell her that she didn't have the same right to get married to her partner as I did to her sister. It was as simple as that. I don't know what Sharon would have done knowing that she could actually make her marriage a reality subsequent to the passing of this legislation. We will never know—she died some years ago, very young—but it's not the point; the point is that she would have had the choice. That's all this legislation seeks to achieve: the freedom of choice to ensure that Sharon's relationship with her partner, as she then was, is held on equal footing with the relationship that I have with her sister. It's as simple as that. I heartily endorse those who have spoken before me on this. The answer is simple: no amendments, no excuses and no more delays. Let's just get on with it. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="138932" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  The Australian people have spoken, and what they've said in an overwhelming majority is that they want this parliament to legislate for same-sex marriage. Sixty-one point six per cent of Australians who participated in the postal plebiscite—or postal vote, if you like—voted yes to same-sex marriage. In my seat of Fairfax, 64.3 per cent of people voted yes. With nearly 80 per cent of all eligible voters participating in the process, I think we can all be sure that this result is indeed fair and is indeed conclusive. Now it falls to this parliament to honour the will of the Australian people and to legislate for same-sex marriage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Changing the definition of marriage is more than a legal issue; it's a social issue—a social issue that holds great cultural significance. This is why I have been, from the get-go, so supportive of a plebiscite as the best process to resolve the matter. I want to acknowledge the leadership of both former Prime Minister Abbott and Prime Minister Turnbull for instigating and delivering on a commitment to empower the Australian people to have their say. The reasons I have supported the plebiscite process so strongly are: firstly, it meant the conscience, the view, of each Australian on the issue of same-sex marriage could be treated equally; secondly, by reflecting the will of the people, the ultimate outcome would have the greatest legitimacy; and, thirdly, experience around the world told us that a public vote on this matter creates greater social cohesion compared to a parliamentary vote alone. With the knowledge that same-sex marriage is a social and cultural issue as much as it is a legal one, it was essential that we, as the government, ensured maximum public engagement so the issue could be truly resolved not just here in this parliament but in our homes and our communities. And that is precisely what we have done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's only appropriate for me to also congratulate my colleagues in this House who prosecuted the case for 'yes' and also those who prosecuted the case for 'no'. They did so with honour, dignity and respect. They did so in the spirit of the very rich, deliberative democracy that Australia is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that the people have spoken, this issue comes to this House, and we have a bill before us, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. I intend to honour the will of the Australian people and support legislation for same-sex marriage. However, I believe this bill can be improved by providing greater protections for freedom of religion and freedom of conscientious belief.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me also point out a deficiency of the bill that I don't believe has been adequately aired, and that is: the bill accords priority to religion over conscience. It assumes religious beliefs are more important than conscientious beliefs. For example, in clause 47 it provides, for religious marriage celebrants, more rights, with respect to solemnising marriage, than for non-religious celebrants. I have a problem with this because I don't believe religious beliefs are more important than conscientious beliefs. In fact, I believe conscience trumps religion. Indeed, the primacy of one's conscience should be sacrosanct. This isn't just a matter of Liberal Party philosophy, although it is our philosophy. It is also a matter of Christian theology. It was once said by a 19th century theologian, John Henry Newman, who also happened to be a cardinal of the Catholic Church at the time: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… I shall drink, — to the Pope, if you please, — still, to Conscience first, and to the Pope afterwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that any amendments to this bill reflect at least parity for conscience and religion so far as the solemnisation of marriage is concerned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If amendments that offer further protections for freedom and freedom of conscientious belief fail to be passed, then I will take comfort in the Prime Minister's announcement of a review into legal protections for religious freedoms in Australia, to be led by Philip Ruddock. Any government review into our freedoms is of the utmost importance, and I can't emphasise that enough. Any review that looks at our freedoms as a nation is critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my maiden speech to this House I said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The foundation upon which I hope our future is built is a common set of values—values that bind all Australians regardless of race, religion or creed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I believe there is no greater value than that of freedom, for nothing else guarantees happiness and fulfilment like freedom, freedom realised through independence, self-reliance and dignity of the individual—ideals that in turn promote protection of free speech and property rights and encourage human endeavour and free enterprise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To my mind, to protect and promote values such as freedom are the very reason we are here in this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me now close by again congratulating everybody who has been involved in this process. I re-affirm my commitment to honour the will of the Australian people by legislating for same-sex marriage while also remaining true to the need to protect the freedom of conscientious and religious beliefs.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  I have to say I've been waiting for quite some time to be able to stand and make this speech in the parliament. I declared, like many who came in on the Labor side in 2013, that, on the day we got to vote on this bill, I'd be speaking in favour of marriage equality, proudly, on behalf of my constituency, and that I'd be voting yes. Before I get into outlining why I'll be voting yes, I just want to speak about why I will be voting against the amendments that have been put forward by the Prime Minister and the member for Warringah.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am actually quite shocked that those opposite in the Liberal Party and the National Party could have sat here yesterday to see that beautiful moment when the member for Goldstein proposed to his partner and said, 'Will you marry me?' It was more than a <span style="font-style:italic;">Love Actually</span> moment. It made this place really human. It spoke to the really personal nature of this debate. But then, if the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill amendments are successful, his colleagues are saying it's okay for a business to discriminate against providing services to them when they're planning their wedding. The proposals that have been put forward by the member for Warringah would allow a taxi, a florist or someone to say, 'We are not going to provide services to you because you're a same-sex couple.' That is wrong. That is just wrong. That is a form of discrimination we outlawed in this country many, many years ago. In this country, there used to be signs in windows saying, 'No blacks allowed.' We outlawed that because that is wrong. We ended that discrimination. We ended discrimination in marriage based upon age, based upon disability and based upon race, yet we've got those opposite who now want to bring it in for people based upon sexuality. That is wrong. That is why Labor will vote against the amendments that have been put forward by the member Warringah. You cannot say on one hand, 'We support marriage equality', but on the other hand allow people to discriminate against that couple. That is disingenuous and it is wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to call out the misinformation during the survey process. Government members are now saying how wonderful it was that the country came together. Say that to all the LGBTI people in my community that had their relationships questioned every day that process went on. Say that to the young people who ended up in Bendigo ED because of the anxiety, because of the stress and because of what they had been put through because of government members and because the Prime Minister was too weak to do his job and allow this parliament to vote on this issue. I want to call out the misinformation about Safe Schools. I had far too many conversations with people in my electorate who thought that this bill was about Safe Schools. It has nothing at all to do with schools. This bill is about marriage equality. This bill is about saying that two people can marry—that love is love. It has absolutely nothing to do with our schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I vote yes to this bill and in favour of marriage equality for the 68.9 per cent of people in my electorate who did stare down this government's divisive campaign around marriage equality and did exercise a vote in favour. The Bendigo electorate result was higher than the national result. It was higher than the Victorian state result. After this agonising and divisive campaign, our result was a real victory for people in our community for coming together to say, 'We are going to stand with the LGBTIQ community and stand with them and vote to demonstrate to the government just how supportive and inclusive we are.' Our result in Bendigo was similar to that of many regional electorates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was asked by some in the media if I was surprised by the result. The answer was no because, like a good MP, I have chatted to people in my community. Since being elected I've had surveys, petitions and conversations. The community made its mind up to support marriage equality in my electorate a long time ago. In the conversations that we had at our street stalls, people who had never engaged in politics said: 'I'm voting yes. I'm telling you I'm voting yes. I'm also telling you I'm very disappointed in the Prime Minister.' Some are people who support the Liberal Party and the Nationals. Unfortunately, my result in the Bendigo electorate is not 68.9 per cent. We know that members of the Liberal Party or the Nationals or voters for them supported marriage equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we didn't need to have a survey to know that. It states very clearly in section 51 of our Constitution that it is the role of this parliament to define the Marriage Act. Whilst overwhelmingly Australians have voted in favour of changing the law, they didn't actually get to change the law, unlike in other countries. The fight isn't over and it is now up to all of us to do our job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I vote yes for every member of the LGBTI community who had to endure physical and verbal attacks as a result of this survey. I vote in favour of this bill for the headspace workers in Bendigo, for the workers at the Bendigo hospital and for all the people in the mental health sector who provide support to our LGBTI community that felt quite confronted and victimised by this survey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I vote yes for the activists in my electorate, the Bendigo Says Yes committee and, in particular, Ethan, Harry, Tash, Nat and Tash, and Harry and Nat, who are here today in the gallery. I acknowledge them for their efforts. I can remember when I messaged Harry. I was sitting in this place and I said: 'We now have to go through with the survey. We should talk to Luke at Bendigo Trades Hall about getting a committee together.' He said, 'Already onto it.' He just reacted and organised and pulled together a great 'yes' campaign. I also acknowledge the Castlemaine Says YES crew, the Kyneton Says Yes crew, Rainbow Labor and Central Victorian Labor branches, who helped support the street stalls, the motions and on-the-ground support. I acknowledge the great community organisations in my electorate like Cobaw health, in the Macedon Ranges, and Haven; Home, Safe, which, without a doubt, said, 'We are with you and we stand with you,' and were a big part of the campaign locally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had to confront the misinformation, and we did so honestly and frankly. I also want to acknowledge the efforts of my office. Outside of work hours on weekends, they got involved in the 'yes' campaign, not because I asked them but because they believed in the campaign and the campaign issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I vote yes today for all the small businesses in my electorate who've expressed support for marriage equality over the years. In 2015, the big businesses of Australia took out an ad to say that they support marriage equality. In my own electorate, businesses decided, 'Let's do the same,' and, led by a local cafe owner, 21 businesses took out a full-page ad in the Saturday <span style="font-style:italic;">Bendigo Advertiser</span> to say that they support marriage equality. They were the first regional community to do so. There were one or two people who said that they will now boycott these businesses because they supported marriage equality. It didn't matter, because every single one of the cafes was full. People bought clothing because they were so proud to go shopping in a business that supported marriage equality. It really helped show our community how committed we were to inclusion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I vote yes for our local media, who've been part of telling the Bendigo and Central Victorian story, and, in particular, Bendigo journalist Mark Kearney, from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bendigo Advertiser</span>, for his positive and inclusive coverage. Mark spoke to me about how this was very hard for him, being part of the LGBTI community—to continue to be independent and impartial on an issue that was so personal to him. But Mark, like the rest of the Bendigo media, did an outstanding job to make sure they told the story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I vote yes for all the schools and school students who've raised this issue with me since I was elected—St Kilian's, St Joey's, Catholic College Bendigo, Girton Grammar School, Bendigo Senior Secondary College, Bendigo South East College, just to name a few. When I asked the students, 'If you were Prime Minister of this country, what would you do?' they all said that their priority would be marriage equality. In fact, in this place not that long ago, Catholic college students who were here held their own vote up on the Queens Terrace, and, when put to the question, 'Would they support marriage equality?' they all voted yes and asked that we in this place do so as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I vote yes for friends on Facebook who wrote comments in the last 24 hours about why they support marriage equality. I vote yes for Maree, who said, 'My family welcomes this bill because, at long last, our son Sean and his husband, Brad, will be equal and legal when they come to live in Australia,' and for Melissa, Reverend of the Anglican Parish of Woodend—in fact, for all of our Anglican parishes—who said: 'Many religious leaders in your electorate are fine with this bill as it is. Many of us voted yes and will be proud when all people are equal under the law.' And I vote yes for Chris and Peter, and all of their friends and family, who will be thrilled at the prospect that they could be married next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also vote yes for friends and family. Like many in this place, this is a personal debate, and they've shared how this law will affect friends and family. I vote yes for Katherine and Erin and their beautiful little girl and for all of the United Voice babies. Shortly after I left United Voice, there was a bit of a baby boom. Four babies were born. Four women were on maternity leave, equal in every way except for two of the couples. They didn't have the choice about marriage and, through this debate, their relationship has now been put on show. Hopefully, those children will never have to know the debate their parents had to go through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I vote yes for good friends Mattie and Shane. Recently, when my partner, Matt, and I caught up with them, we were talking about how this debate has affected them. They are older; they came out in the eighties, when it wasn't popular to do so. They faced a lot of discrimination and this debate brought up a lot of old memories for them. It also brought up a lot of challenges in community, in society and with friends and family—debates they shouldn't have had to have. They've been together for 15 years. I look at their relationship and go, 'I just hope that so many other Australians can have the kind of wonderful, loving and respectful relationship that they have.' They may never choose to get married, but if we pass this bill it's a choice they get to have—just like Matt and I could have. Matt and Shane should be able to have the same choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up in a household where my parents were not happily married. Married, yes—but not happy. There was not love. As a teenager, this did affect my views on marriage. People who knew me as a teenager would probably be quite surprised that I'm now very supportive of marriage. When I was young, because it wasn't a happy household, I saw marriage as a prison sentence, trapping wives and children in unhappy marriages, unsafe marriages and quite fixed gender roles. It wasn't until later in life when I started to attend the weddings of good friends that I realised that marriage today is about love.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Love is love, and that is why I support marriage equality. I vote yes today because, like many on the Labor side, I believe that marriage equality is a human right. It is about equity before the law. Across central Victoria and the electorate of Bendigo, an area that I'm so proud to represent in this place, I vote yes today for all of the local businesses and for the religious and the community leaders who have stood and said, 'It's time; vote yes.' The advocacy groups, the individuals and all the young people who many years ago signed the petitions and started the campaigns, I vote yes for them. They have declared publicly and loudly that they support marriage equality and that it's time. It's time for all of us in this place to respect them and their values, and it is time that we voted yes.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWS" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:57</span>):  It was Churchill who told us that democracy was the worst form of government, except for all of the rest. So it has been with our postal survey: democracy has been celebrated. It has shown that it can succeed, with a postal survey to assess the country's desire to legalise same-sex marriage. Despite all the warnings of confrontation in the streets; despite the efforts to derail the process in the High Court, sponsored by no less than the Labor Party; and despite the distrustful statements that Australians could not be trusted to debate this issue in a civilised manner, it was, and has been, a resounding success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This policy, this process, has provided a way for all Australians to accept the results in a way that the parliamentary process probably could never have done. It was 79.5 per cent of the Australian population, just a slither below four in five eligible Australians, who participated in what was a voluntary process. They embraced the postal survey and loaded up the postboxes, which, according to some critics, they would not be able to find. Most importantly, after a couple of fairly scratchy weeks, active participants in the campaign came to realise that, where they sponsored confrontation and attempted to vilify others, they were losing public support. Yes, there were a number of conflicting situations that were lifted into the national profile. But we could all see mainstream Australia turning its back on that type of campaigning, and so it was that the most strident campaigners toned it down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that way, the postal survey was a victory for middle Australia. They insisted the debate be conducted in a civilised way. We should always hold the intelligence of the Australian people in high regard. That is why I made a commitment to follow the advice provided to me by the people through the plebiscite, taking particular note of the wishes of the Grey electorate. It is well known that my personal view was to oppose change to the current arrangements, and I voted against it. But I did also commit to following the advice of the Australian public and, in particular, the Grey electorate. And so it was that 61.6 per cent of Australians voted in favour of change, 62.5 per cent of South Australians vote in favour of change and, most importantly, 53.3 per cent of the Grey electorate voted in favour. True, the vote in Grey was almost 10 per cent below the national and state averages, but it was still in favour. I cannot with a clear conscience deny that majority, so I will support change in this area. To those who have campaigned for this change: congratulations. To those wonderful families and individuals who have come to me seeking change over the years: while we may have disagreed, I have recognised your genuine intentions. I also recognise all of the wonderful constituents who have come to me seeking that the current act be maintained in its current form. But I urge all to respect others who have differing views and to work together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next 48 hour in this place will be very interesting as we seek to find a form of words with suitable protections for others directly affected by changes to the Marriage Act to allow them to exercise legitimate choices, and I am carefully examining the amendments which have been circulated. My chief concern has been in the areas of education, where I fear Commonwealth support for independent—mainly religious based—schools may be threatened if they choose not to teach same-sex marriage as equal in every way, in direct contravention of their religious tenets. At this time, I am confident that most parties in the parliament are determined that that should not happen—at least, that is what they say. But who can say how it will all end?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not convinced that any protections for schools' rights are best placed in the Marriage Act; in fact, I am pretty confident they probably aren't. Perhaps those types of reforms would be better placed in the education funding structures or even the antidiscrimination act. That is why I am pleased the Prime Minister has appointed Philip Ruddock to review religious protections. Mr Ruddock, a former Attorney-General, a former Father of the House and a former member for Berowra—which is a very multicultural electorate—will report by the end of March. I expect that further work will need to be done in this area at that time. But today I congratulate those who have brought about change, and I celebrate the democracy that we live in. I thank the Australian people for their engagement and involvement in the process, and I'm determined that we should celebrate the country that we live in, with all of its diversity.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Denison</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  Much is made of the claim that there is no need to change the Marriage Act because gay and lesbian people already have equal rights in Australia. But that assertion is wrong on at least two counts. Firstly, the Marriage Act, as it currently stands, is legislated discrimination because it explicitly limits marriage to be between a man and a woman. Secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, let's not forget the power of the symbolism in this discrimination and the fact that, at the end of the day, this country, through its current law, treats gay and lesbian people, and the love they feel for others, as inferior to love by heterosexual couples and the recognition of that love. In other words, the laws don't just tell us how to act in Australia; they tell us how we think in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud to be from a state that has consistently led the marriage equality issue. In 2003, Tasmania was the first state to adopt a civil union scheme. In 2005, we became the first state to see the introduction of state legislation allowing same-sex marriages. In 2008, we were the first state where a Labor Party state conference endorsed marriage equality. The state Liberal Party also led the way by being the first in Australia to allow a conscience vote on marriage equality in the state parliament. In 2012, the lower house of the Tasmanian state parliament became the first in Australia to pass marriage equality legislation, co-sponsored by the Labor Party and the Greens. We have also been the first state to have both houses of parliament pass motions supporting marriage equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the postal survey Tasmania's vote was well above the national vote, and I'm so proud to say that my own electorate of Denison returned one of the highest 'yes' votes of any electorate right throughout this country. Upon reflection, I think Tasmania has led the way because being the last state to decriminalise homosexuality—in 1997—taught us firsthand the damage caused by prejudice and taught us the importance of inclusion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, none of that would have been achieved and nor would we be here this week looking to finally legislate marriage equality if it weren't for the efforts of a great many people. First and foremost, I would like to recognise Rodney Croome, who is with us today in the gallery, along with some of the other people that I recognise. Rodney is a longtime campaigner for LGBTI rights. He was involved in the fight for law reform in Tasmania and was arrested in 1988 after setting up a stall at the Salamanca Market, calling for homosexuality to be decriminalised. In 1994, Rodney was involved in taking the criminalisation of homosexuality in Tasmania to the High Court and to the United Nations. He has been the national director of Australian Marriage Equality and currently serves as the spokesperson for the Tasmanian Gay and Lesbian Rights Group. More recently, Rodney was the Tasmanian Australian of the Year in 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have many other people I would like to recognise and I hope they will forgive me for mispronouncing some of their names. I see sitting in the gallery Shelley Argent from Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays; Peter Furness, the founding convenor of Australian Marriage Equality; Dr Sharon Dane, marriage equality researcher; and John Kloprogge, an AME volunteer and just.equal board member. There are also Jason and Adrian Tuazon-McCheyne, Jac Tomlins and Sarah Nicols, the couples who first filed to have their overseas same-sex marriages recognised in 2003, which prompted then Prime Minister John Howard to—shamefully—amend the Marriage Act in 2004.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to recognise all of the people at Tasmanians United for Marriage Equality, who helped to ensure Tasmania returned a postal survey result above the national average. I especially recognise Megan Tudehope, Rajan Venkatamaran, Vincent Bound, Richard Hale, former Antidiscrimination Commissioner Robyn Banks and Sam Watson. They are all Hobart people. It is really good to mention them today because they all went above and beyond the call of duty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, a lot of people have said a lot of things about marriage equality these last few months, including in this place this week. Much I have agreed with, but some I have not, and I certainly don't agree with those speakers who want any amendments to this bill. But, frankly, the time for talking is over, and now we should just do this thing because ultimately marriage equality is just about love.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="9V5" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PYNE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:10</span>):  I rise to support the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. This is a cause which I have long supported and I am gratified and proud in so doing, now to find myself in company with the overwhelming majority of the Australian people. I rise to support this bill because I am a Liberal, and liberalism stands for freedom: for every freedom consistent with the equal freedom of one's fellow citizens; for every freedom consistent alike with the good of the individual and the general good of society; for every freedom that emerges from and sustains the inherent dignity of humanity. I support this bill because it establishes a new freedom of precisely such a kind, yet one that has been denied too long, too cruelly and too often with such meagre and patently disingenuous defences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be the equal right of gay men and women, in common with their fellow countrymen, to shoulder in full the responsibilities and enjoy in full the privileges that are attached to the institution of civil marriage. That means more than one merely creating under a different name some second-rate, technical, de facto correspondence between the rights of gay couples and the rights of their heterosexual counterparts. Equality means equality. Their commitment is no less deep, their fidelity no less enduring, their love no less worthy of the rituals of official recognition and public acceptance that have become the familiar hallmarks of the marriage ceremony as we know it. To accord them a different status is to accord them a lesser status and in reality to perpetuate the shameful history of discrimination and humiliation against which gay and lesbian Australians have had to struggle so long and so bitterly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other reasons I support this bill. I do so because, like former British Prime Minister David Cameron, I realise, as I think all on the conservative side of politics should realise, that marriage equality is something that should be supported not in spite of being conservative, but because it is the conservative thing to do. Conservatism should not be the enemy of change. The spirit of true conservatism is about keeping what is best in our institutions and improving what is not. Marriage is rightly at the heart of our social system. It is the institution most conducive to the happiness of family life and with it the stability of community life. That is not simply because it creates a stable framework in which to raise children, vitally important though that might be, but also because men and women, all of us, by our nature crave love, compassion, support and understanding—all of those things which find their highest expression in the marriage bond.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not pretend, of course, that all marriages are successful, but all successful marriages are a boon to society and we do our society harm by withholding the blessings of marriage from a whole section of the community who are just as qualified and more than willing to embrace its responsibilities and share in its benefits. There are now 45,000 households in Australia with children of same-sex couples whom this law will enfranchise in a way that expunges forever the enforced shame of second-class status that has so far been their lot. That is progress and that is improvement—improvement of a kind that brings new vigour and new relevance to one of our most revered institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say something about religion because I am an observant Catholic, and it is because of my religion and not in spite of it that I support this bill. The separation of church and state is the foundation of our civil order. It is enshrined in section 116 of our Constitution, which precludes the Commonwealth from making laws for establishing any religion, imposing any religious observance or prohibiting the free exercise of any religion. The protection of the free exercise of religion is an important part of that principle and accordingly finds expression in the amendments proposed in the bill to section 47 and the insertion of proposed sections 47A, 47B and 71A of the Marriage Act 1961. These permit religious marriage celebrants and religious organisations to decline to participate in a marriage which does not conform to their religious tenets, which is only fair and reasonable. But it is not and never was necessary for the protection of religious freedom to disallow same-sex marriage altogether.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am satisfied that these changes protect religious freedom in this country. I do not support the insertion of unnecessary amendments. As a matter of principle, acts of parliament should not contain superfluous clauses, especially superfluous clauses based on the opinion that Australia's laws don't adequately protect the religious freedoms that we have cherished since Federation. I firmly believe that they do. It would be a betrayal of the separation of church and state to deny the equal right of all citizens to contract civil marriage simply because of the sacramental restrictions that apply to holy matrimony. It would also be hypocritical. We do not deny civil marriage to infertile couples or divorcees, even though these too are traditional impediments to Christian marriage. That is because it is plainly wrong for the law of the state to disqualify citizens from secular rights by reference to religious laws, let alone the laws of a religion which those citizens may not even profess.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nevertheless, we do well to remember that in Australia, as in all Western democracies, the legacy of Christian ethics lies at the heart of our polity and that the church has contributed immeasurably over the centuries to the historical development of our way of thinking as a community. So too the nobler instincts of religion—justice, charity, forbearance and love—continue to inform our culture and indeed underpin the very reasons we as a community instinctively deplore injustice, discrimination and prejudice. Yet religious tenets must never become in themselves the prescriptive basis of our lawmaking. That way lies oppression. Reason, fair dealing and even-handedness must always remain the yardstick of our secular laws, but reason is not to be thought, on that account, the enemy of faith. Reason too is a gift from God and can illumine our shortcomings as articulately as the voice of conscience. Reason, let it be said, commends this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am fortified in this regard by the recently stated views of the rectors of the Jesuit colleges of Riverview in Sydney and Xavier in Melbourne, sister colleges of my own St Ignatius Adelaide, that the achievement of this legislation is consistent with the gospel of Christ. So let it not be thought that there is nothing the church can learn from the world—a world which, after all, she raised in its infancy. Chief amongst those lessons from which the church might most profit is the warning not to mistake immutability for truth or intransigence for virtue, for reason alone, unclouded by superstition, tells us that homosexuality is no more abnormal than left-handedness, that sexual orientation is innate and not conditioned, and that the expression of love between two men or between two women is not to be stigmatised because of the words of an ancient text or the prejudices of an unscientific age. Too many young people have taken their lives or had them taken from them because of the words of an ancient text. Nor is same-sex attraction a disorder to be reversed, much less an illness to be cured, and much less a vice to be brutalised by punishment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it behoves us in this place to ensure that these same tired and destructive prejudices, which have wrought enough wretchedness and suffering in their time, should not be permitted to continue to disenfranchise any Australian from participating in the one institution of society by which our laws respond to our greatest virtue by taking love and enhancing it with the social status it inherently deserves. To all gay and lesbian Australians, but especially to all those young men and women who have struggled with their sexual orientation in the confines of a once unsympathetic culture, I say: here is a law to challenge and in time to bring an end to all the unthinking denigration and casual condescension that they once routinely had to endure and which many, tragically, could not endure. And it will be brought to an end—of that I am certain—because, in concert with the peoples of the civilised world, it is now overwhelmingly the expressed will of the Australian people that it be brought to an end. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. On 14 November at 10 am the result of the marriage law postal survey was announced. The result was clear and definitive. Australia said yes, the state of Victoria said yes and my electorate of Wills said yes. More than 7.8 million Australians, 61.6 per cent of voters, voted yes for marriage equality. This 'yes' vote was carried in every state and every territory. Seventy per cent of constituents in my electorate of Wills said they wanted to see Australian marriage law change to allow same-sex couples to marry, and this was from an 83 per cent turnout of voters in Wills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the fact is that the Turnbull Liberal government chose to spend $122 million on a postal survey that was non-binding, a waste of taxpayers' money and needlessly damaging and divisive. The result in no way alters this fact and the fact also that it was fundamentally an abrogation of our responsibilities as elected representatives in our federal parliament, a representative democracy here in Australia, and our role and responsibility to make and amend laws. And all of these responsibilities have been effectively deferred to the work that we have before us for the last few days of this week. It is now time for the parliament and its representatives to do what they were elected to do, which is to vote on legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I supported marriage equality well before the postal survey. In fact, during the last election campaign, I made very clear what my position was, and I publicly stated I would vote yes regardless of the results of the survey because the principle of equality before the law, regardless of one's ethnicity, one's faith or one's gender or sexual preference should be the fundamental basis of our secular democracy, and in fact it is the same principle that underpins freedom of religion for religious minorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Freedom of religion, freedom from religion, and the separation of religion and state, as we have heard from previous speakers, are all fundamental principles of our secular democracy. Indeed it is my conviction that in order to ensure religious freedom, which is sadly lacking in many autocratic states overseas, where many religious minorities are persecuted because of their faith, we must maintain the principle of equality before the law for all, and that is what protects those in religious minorities from any impingement by the state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come from a community which is more traditional. I come from an Egyptian background. We have heard from many previous speakers that many of the more recent migrants to this country have voted no in parts of Western Sydney and other parts of Australia. They are entitled to their views. One thing I have tried to explain to people in those communities, whether they be imams in the local mosques in my electorate or priests in the local churches, is that the reason they are able to practise their religion so freely in Australia, the reason the state can't interfere in their freedom of worship, is that principle of being treated equally under the law in this country, a treatment that is not afforded to them in countries that do not share the secular principles of democracy that we have here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Australians have made their views very clear in this postal survey. The parliament must ensure that the will of the people becomes law as soon as possible. There has been more than enough dithering and delay by the government on this critical issue. We on the Labor side have been very clear from the outset of this debate that we do respect freedom of religion as one of the foundations of our diverse and harmonious society, but it is true to say that we don't believe that marriage equality and religious freedom are mutually exclusive. While there is a respect for religious freedom, we do not believe that same-sex marriage in Australia warrants a repeal of antidiscrimination laws. This is not what Australians voted for when they voted for marriage equality in such large numbers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The protections for religious freedoms set out in the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, which was introduced by Senator Smith on 15 November and passed by the Senate on 29 November, strike an acceptable compromise between achieving marriage equality and protecting religious freedoms. These religious protections included in the bill are based on the unanimous recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on the Exposure Draft of the Marriage Amendment (Same-Sex Marriage) Bill. This committee consulted extensively with communities and stakeholders across Australia, and its cross-party members worked very hard to reach a consensus position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation, this bill before us, contains provisions that preserve religious freedom in the performance of the marriage ceremony and the provision of goods and services reasonably incidental to the marriage ceremony. Respect for those views held by people of faith and respect for the rights of religious institutions is, as I have said, a fundamental part of our civil society. As several speakers have suggested before me, it is appropriate that the parliament take the proper time to carefully consider what protections are required as a separate matter to this particular legislation. We will see recommendations from the panel convened by Philip Ruddock in the coming weeks, and the Australian Labor Party will consider them carefully.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some key principles are what guide us in supporting the bill that is before us. One is a commitment to religious freedom and the ability of churches and other religious institutions to practise wedding and marriage ceremonies according to their own religious doctrines because, as we've said, freedom of religion is a constitutional right—section 116—and must be respected. Also, there is the important principle that the Australian people have spoken—and we've heard that result—but, more than that, there is the principle of confirming equality before the law, which is what we have before us in this place. We won't stand for delay or further discrimination as part of this process. This is the kind of common sense approach that, I think it is true to say, we are committed to. As such, I don't support further measures or amendments—argued for by some—that would have the effect of rolling back existing antidiscrimination laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum to the bill, which we endorse, makes this position very clear. Specifically, at point 64, it states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Commercial businesses, their employees and independent operators who provide goods or services, or make facilities available, are currently prohibited from discriminating in connection with marriages on various grounds including race, age and disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These prohibitions have been in place for a significant period of time, and they ensure that people are treated equally in public life and protected from discrimination. Point 65 further states that 'the bill does not propose any new carve outs', particularly for the LGBTIQ community. Whatever you are—whether you are a taxi driver, florist, baker or whatever other examples have been raised—if you don't work for a body established for religious purposes, you can't lawfully refuse to drive a person to their wedding reception or provide them with the flowers or prepare a wedding cake. These are part of existing antidiscrimination laws which don't allow refusal for service, and this will continue on with this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a difficult debate for some people, but it's an important debate. Ultimately, though, it's quite simple. All Australians should be treated equally under the law, regardless of their sexual preference, faith, gender or ethnicity. This is the foundation principle that protects minorities in our secular democracy. In order for us to protect those minorities in this democracy, we need to make sure that that equality before the law is given to all before the law. It is the principle that is tied to the principle of freedom of religion and to the separation of religion and state. This has been a long process—one that could have been completed much earlier if we didn't have to go through the postal survey—and I commend the bill to the House. I look forward to returning to the chamber in the not too distant future to vote yes on the bill. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:28</span>):  I rise today as the federal member for Flynn to offer my thoughts to the private member's bill to change the Marriage Act, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. The question before us today is to change the definition of 'marriage' in the act from 'between a man and a woman' to 'between two persons'. A successful change to the Marriage Act aims to deliver legal and equal recognition to same-sex marriage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Geographically, Flynn is twice the size of Tasmania, and the views in Flynn are as diverse as the electorate is large. The people of Flynn are compassionate, fair-minded and hardworking Australians. Changes to the Marriage Act are a significant question for Australians and Australia. It should not be done lightheartedly, as families, indeed strong families, are the pillars of a strong society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only way they could change the Marriage Act was after consulting with the Australian people. We made the promise to consult with the Australian people as an election promise in 2016, an election that we went onto win. The coalition won the 2016 election, and we clearly demonstrated the will of Australians to have their opinion heard on this very important issue. With almost 80 per cent of eligible Australians taking part in this voluntary survey, it clearly supported the government's decision to fulfil an election undertaking, and it was the correct and appropriate manner to answer this question once and for all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I gave an undertaking to the people of Flynn that I'd uphold the decision of all Australians. Flynn returned a vote for yes, and more than 76 per cent of the electorate wanted their opinion to be heard. The Flynn vote accorded with the Australian vote, and 62 per cent of Australians voted in favour of a change to the Marriage Act. Therefore, I feel duty-bound to vote according to the wishes of the electorate. While I'll be upholding the wishes of the electorate in this legislation and endorsing their wish to change the Marriage Act to 'two persons', I should also hold true to the values the coalition stands for, values such as freedom to hold and express a view, freedom of parents to have the final oversight as to how their children are educated and freedom of religious beliefs and expressions, and decisions of religious organisations and their assets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other members of parliament will act according to their convictions and with their personal beliefs, in contrast with their electorates. I do not offer advice or judgement upon their actions and how they vote in the chamber. However, I will uphold the commitment I made to the electorate of Flynn and I vote according to the wishes of the majority of Australians.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:32</span>):  I rise today to speak in support of the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, which has such significant meaning for our country, for the many LGBTIQ Australians, for their friends and family and for everyone in our community, because this week we vote to make our country a more equal place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Being a member of parliament is a strange role in many ways. I am acutely aware that some of what we do in this chamber is irrelevant and remote to the lives of the people we represent, such as the argy-bargy that goes on in question time and the foolish debates that don't change a thing for anyone. I don't mind admitting I find that side of politics intensely frustrating. But other days, being a member of parliament couldn't mean any more, and today is one of those days. Today, we make a change that will affect people in a real way. Today, we help define our country in the way Australians have told us and shown us they want it to be defined. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This victory does not belong to me. I have been in parliament for four years. Prior to that, strong activists, people like Senator Penny Wong and others, have done decades of hard yards on this question. I feel like I got to help out in the advocacy for this, which was a really positive experience, where there was a lot of goodwill in the community, but I am well aware that this has been an incredibly long fight, and I know that, at times, it has been gut wrenching, a slog and a battle in the trenches.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to some of the groups I think have played a very important role in this. One of those groups is Rainbow Labor. This is a group of extraordinarily committed activists who have joined our party, and they stay in our party because they know that getting this political party on to the government benches is the only way to move this country forward on the issues that they are passionate about. For every one of those Rainbow Labor people who has spent so many years of their lives fighting for issues just like this one, this progress belongs to you, and I am so grateful for your efforts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say a few words about young people. They can be a maligned group in our country, ever being accused of not caring enough about things that really matter. In their engagement in this discussion, they showed us that that is wrong. I want to salute the young people of this country for standing up and making their voices heard. We know the plebiscite process that was set up was always going to favour older people to participate at higher rates. But I want to point out one thing that really got me on the day that the result was announced. The highest participation of any group of Australians under the age of 50 was 18- to 19-year-old women, 82 per cent of whom voted. Not only was it the first time that most of those young women had voted; it was the first time many of them had ever posted a letter. This makes my heart sing for the future. It makes me believe we are in safe hands. I want those young women to know that I believe passionately in them and their ability to make our country better and stronger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the end, it was young people who got us over the line. I think we all knew that was going to be the case. It tells us one of the fundamental truths of social change, and that is that we need young people to speak up loud if we want society to change for the better. In my experience of life and getting older, I see that we're very susceptible as humans to believing that the environment we are in at a particular point in time can't possibly change. But young people see things differently. They see how things can be different. Young people today are doing something that no generation has ever been able to do before. They are standing up in schools—even in primary schools—universities and workplaces and saying for the first time that LGBTIQ people actually deserve full equality in this country. They are working to achieve it and they are succeeding. That is something the generations who went before me have not been able to do and my generation hasn't been able to do. But those young people are doing it for us. I'm so proud of, and grateful for, their efforts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a few comments on the plebiscite. It wasn't a good idea. It wasn't a unifying moment. The only people I have heard say this was a unifying moment are straight people. When I think about the experience the plebiscite put my friends through, I am very angry. A lot of people who are in a better position than me can talk about their personal experience of this. But I want to share with you one gut-wrenching moment that I have experienced. A lot of young people congregated around my office to go and talk to families about how they were going to vote on this incredibly important issue. A lot of those people identified as being gay. It was gut-wrenching to go out with those young people and watch them have to knock on doors and have the people at home tell them they would be voting no in the plebiscite and then to see their faces when they came back to me. The Prime Minister needs to understand there is a generation of young people who will never forgive him for making them go through that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to focus, though, on the really big, important aspect of this, and that is that Australians said yes. Some people I spoke with connected very strongly with the idea of this being about the more legalistic arguments about fundamental human rights. But a lot of the people I talked to voted yes as a simple act of generosity. A lot of people said to me, 'This doesn't affect me, but why would I stand in the path of something so important to someone else?' I found that to be a very Australian attitude—the best of the warmth, openness and tolerance of this amazing country that I get to represent in this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent quite a bit of time talking to people who I know voted no in the plebiscite. Every member of parliament takes a different approach to how they represent their community; for me, it's very important to engage with people who have a different point of view. I sat down with a lot of people who I knew would vote no. I had a cup of tea with them and talked to them about their issues. I really wanted to understand why because, to me, it's challenging to see why you would not want this to happen. So I sat down with people and I talked to them about it to try to understand their perspective. One of the top issues that kept coming up was Safe Schools. I heard a lot about people's concerns about the way gender is changing in society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But when I had these conversations with people, after we'd talked for a while, something would come out towards the end of the conversation that was quite fundamental. That was that some people in this country fundamentally believe that there is something wrong with being gay. That was the honest view that was expressed to me in my office. I say that without judgement, but that was always a place where the conversation kind of reached an impasse, because I have a fundamentally different view. I don't believe there's anything wrong with being gay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the arguments that I disagreed with the 'yes' campaign on was the argument that this change that we're going to make this week in this parliament is a small thing—just a few small words in a piece of legislation. I just don't agree with that. I don't think this is about a small thing; I think this is about a very big thing. This is about our nation reaching out. It's a nation making it clear that LGBTIQ people belong, and that's not a small thing. It matters a great deal. It matters a great deal in particular to young people. Deputy Speaker, I know you'll be very well aware of the statistics. We know that young people who are having questions about their sexuality are about five times as likely to attempt suicide as other young Australians. But, as with most things, statistics tell you one part of the story but it's human experience that fills in the gaps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have, of course—like almost everyone in this chamber, surely—gone through the experience of watching my friends come out. It's incredibly hard for them. It really is. It's hard for them to come out in what they see as a society and a country that doesn't respect them as fully equal human beings. I see them go on that journey and then I see that, even after they've come out and even when they're living a life acknowledging the true person that they are, they bear some scars from that experience that they went through. I don't think that anyone should have to go through that experience. No-one in this country who is questioning their sexuality should feel they are any less of a person, that they are less valued or that they are less respected. Today we say that as a parliament. That's why I say this is not a small change; it is a huge change, because this is our country saying, 'We love you, we respect you and we want you to have the full rights and opportunities that we get to enjoy'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so much of what we do in politics, this debate has not been pretty. Politics can be a very ugly business. It's never as clean, clear and perfect as we want it to be. A lot of people hate politics, and we know that a lot of people have diminishing faith in its ability to make any changes. But I want to say something to those people. Just have a look at how our laws have changed and how our society has changed just in my lifetime. I'm 37 years old. In the year I was born in Victoria, gay sex was a crime. I was 17 by the time Tasmania decriminalised being gay. When I joined the Labor Party, I was 16 years old. Marriage equality was never going to happen. It was not even part of the political discussion in any mainstream way, because it was unthinkable. Here I stand before the parliament less than two decades later, and we're about to give LGBTIQ Australians equal rights before the law. Soon a gay wedding is going to be completely unremarkable. Society can change. It does change. This has given me and so many other Australians hope. Our political system isn't pretty, but what matters most is that it can be used to change our society for the better, and I am so deeply privileged to be a part of that change today.</span>

Firstly, this has been a good process, reflecting the best elements of Australia's democratic traditions. Secondly, this good process happened with no thanks at all to the Labor Party. Thirdly, it is important to respect the views of all Australians as we go through this process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why has this been a good process? The coalition took a promise to the 2016 election that, before putting same-sex marriage to the parliament, we would give the Australian people the chance to have their say, and we delivered on that promise. Nearly 80 per cent of eligible voters participated. That's a very high level of participation for a voluntary exercise, a good sign for our democracy. A particularly good sign is the number of young people who participated, far in excess of some of the gloomy predictions. There was a clear result nationally with 61.6 per cent of Australians voting yes, and a clear result in my electorate of Bradfield. In Bradfield, 60.6 per cent of respondents voted yes, very close to the national average. This is an outcome which is important in achieving community acceptance of what is a significant social change.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take a classical Liberal position: the harm principle articulated by John Stuart Mill, which states:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">today we would say 'against his or her will'—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is in accordance with that position I voted yes in the postal survey. In accordance with the position that I have consistently stated given that both the Australian people and the people of Bradfield have, by majority vote, expressed their support for the law being amended to permit same-sex couples to marry, I will be voting yes on this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This good process and this outcome have been achieved with no thanks at all to the Labor Party. When you saw the opposition leader on 29 November turning up at the rally in Melbourne proudly proclaiming 'Today we celebrate, tomorrow we legislate', you would think this was a man seeing his own painstaking work come to fruition. But you would be naive and credulous to think that because the facts are clear: the Leader of the Opposition didn't want the law to change in December 2017. He wanted nothing to happen until after the election in 2019 so he could use this as a campaign issue. His most recent position has been trenchant opposition to the Australian people being given a say. He said, 'We will oppose this ill-conceived, ill-thought-out plebiscite.' But the Leader of the Opposition has been as inconsistent and slippery on this issue as he was on the issue of whether he supported Kevin Rudd or Julia Gillard for the Labor leadership. Remember the Leader of the Opposition told the Australian Christian Lobby on 13 August 2013 that he 'would rather the people of Australia could make their view clear on this than leaving this issue to 150 people'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The facts are also clear that Labor had six years in government and did nothing to deliver this important social change. In fact, Julia Gillard was adamant in 2012 that the Labor government would not be introducing legislation to change the definition of marriage. In yet another slippery display from the Leader of the Opposition, having said earlier this year that Labor was calling for a free vote in parliament, what Labor is actually doing now is not allowing Labor MPs a conscience vote on amendments whereas the Liberal Party has a free vote on every aspect of this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had a good process but it is very important we respect the views of all Australians, including the more than five million who voted no. They were motivated by a range of factors, including concerns about the maintenance of religious freedom. This is a very important issue, which is why the Turnbull government has committed to hold a separate inquiry into the protections of religious freedom in this country to be led by the Hon. Philip Ruddock AO. A number of my constituents have raised concerns with me that religious leaders and institutions may face restrictions on maintaining teachings about marriage which have been core principles of their faith over centuries, indeed millennia. There are, of course, provisions within the bill before the House designed to address these issues. In addition, a number of amendments have been put before the parliament on these issues and I will examine these amendments on their merits before finalising my position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of my constituents have also raised concerns with me about the social engineering agenda being pursued in schools by people like the Marxist educator Roz Ward. Many parents very much disagree, for example, with the idea that primary school children should be required to engage in workshops about gender identity and same-sex attraction. While that is not the subject matter of this bill, it is important to acknowledge the very real parental concerns on these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me conclude by returning to the subject matter of this bill. The Turnbull government has carried out a process which has allowed the Australian people to have their say in the face of trenchant and politically cynical opposition from Labor. The outcome, which we are arriving at, reflects leadership by the Prime Minister. I also want to congratulate the members for North Sydney, Brisbane, Goldstein, Leichhardt and Senator Dean Smith on the work they have done to get to the point that we are at today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a matter which is of considerable importance to gay and lesbian Australians. The Australian people have by a clear majority stated their opinion that the institution of marriage, this powerful force for good in our society, should be available to Australians in a same-sex relationship as it is to Australians in a heterosexual relationship. I welcome that decision and I am pleased to have the opportunity to express my support for this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  Today is a great day for Australia. Today we say yes to equality. We say yes to love. Soon we'll have the all-too-rare privilege of casting a vote to extend the great Australian ideal of fairness and equality to every gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and intersex person. We'll get the chance to make this country a better place. Every single Australian deserves to be treated equally under the law no matter who they are or who they love.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Above all things Australians value fairness and equality, but for too long the institution of marriage has been one that excludes one group of Australians, and in so doing we have sent a powerful message not just about marriage but about equality, discrimination and exclusion. It's the wrong message and it's hurt a lot of people. Today we right that wrong. Today we send a new message: one of hope, inclusion and love. Everyone deserves the right to be married if that is what they want. Everyone deserves to be able to choose the way in which they want to live their life and to choose how they want to celebrate and develop their relationships. That's why I'll be once again voting yes for marriage equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My partner, Ross, and I have been together for nearly 40 years. We have three children and now a granddaughter. We don't want or need anyone to sanctify our relationship. It is strong and loyal and loving. But the difference is we've been able to choose to build our family according to our principles, and LGBTIQ people should be able to do the same. I do not want a church or the state involved in my personal relationship. I adore my father and love my partner, but the idea that I would be given like a piece of property from one man to another is totally antithetical to me. The patriarchal views of many religions do not align with my ethical beliefs that men and women should be equal, and the same is true, from my ethical standpoint, about LGBTIQ people. They too should have the right to live with and love who they choose and marry if they want to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015 I received an email from a constituent of mine, Tiffany Talberg. Tiffany wrote: 'As a gay woman, this issue is very close to my heart. I may or may not want to marry a partner in the future, but that doesn't mean I should be denied the option of marrying the one I love.' Tiffany is right. She should have the freedom to marry the person she loves, and, with the passage of this legislation, she will soon have that freedom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that many Australians were ahead of the parliament on this issue. It is a reform that is long overdue. In my own electorate of Jagajaga, 73.5 per cent of people voted in favour of marriage equality. I do want to congratulate everyone who was involved in the 'yes' campaign. I especially want to give a shout-out to those from Trades Hall in Victoria who campaigned tirelessly for equality. In particular, I want to thank Will Strack, who ran the field campaign.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to especially acknowledge and pay tribute to all the rainbow families who I know have had a difficult time with this public debate about their private lives. Let me be very clear: the postal survey was unnecessary. It caused needless pain for LGBTIQ Australians. We didn't need this process to decide to end discrimination against gay and lesbian people and whether or not they should be able to marry who they choose. We never needed a process whereby strangers got a say in determining whether some relationship between two people was more equal than others. For many LGBTIQ Australians who struggled with their identity early in their lives, the postal survey took them back to a place of insecurity—a place where they were told they needed to seek acceptance from the rest of the community to be who they are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I especially want to acknowledge and congratulate so many LGBTIQ Australians who've campaigned for this day for so many years—and it has been a very long time. In 1949, the death penalty was still on the books for sodomy in Victoria. It took until 1980 for the Hamer government to decriminalise homosexuality in Victoria, and in Tasmania male homosexuality wasn't decriminalised until 1997, so we have come a long way. One of the positive things about this debate is that it has energised and engaged young people. They are a new generation that's becoming politicised because the issue of marriage equality touches them at such an emotional level. Young Australians just cannot abide discrimination against LGBTIQ Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to especially pay tribute to my good friend and colleague Penny Wong. Her leadership has been so strong and so constant. We are incredibly lucky to have her. I especially want to acknowledge Sophie, Alexandra and Hannah. Our thanks and love go to the three of you. Another great Labor senator, Louise Pratt, has been such a tower of strength during this debate, and I know how much this means to her and her wonderful family, especially Jasper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to briefly talk about a school in my electorate: Eltham High School. Eltham High was one of the 10 founding schools to support the Safe Schools Coalition program, which aims to create a safe and supportive school environment for same-sex attracted, intersex and gender diverse people. I remember a speech that the principal, Vincent Sicari, gave to the students after the murder of more than 50 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando in the United States in 2016. He told his students, 'I cannot expect you to value diversity and individuality and have social responsibility if I remain silent when things like this occur.' For the remainder of the week, the rainbow flag flew at half-mast at the front of the school as a sign of respect and solidarity. I want to congratulate Eltham High for its leadership on inclusion in our education system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also briefly want to talk about religious freedom. These matters have been raised a lot in this debate. Some of the amendments that have been proposed to this bill by conservative members are seeking to extend exemptions from the Sex Discrimination Act and various state antidiscrimination laws. I want to say loud and clear today that I do not support any of these amendments. Our antidiscrimination laws are important. There are, rightly, limits to religious freedom. Discrimination on the basis of sex, race, sexual preference or anything else is unacceptable in a modern society like Australia. Do we really want to go back to a place where someone can be refused service—where you can refuse to bake them a cake or drive them in your car—because they're gay? The Australian people do not want that, and I certainly will not support it. We all know that no religious minister under this bill need marry a gay couple against his or her conscience. Churches are able to determine who they marry and who they don't and will continue to do so. These amendments that some conservatives want to move aren't about protecting religious freedom; they are, in fact, an underhanded attempt to water down our antidiscrimination laws, and I certainly won't be supporting any such amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now want to speak, in closing, directly to LGBTIQ Australians. You are no less than other people because of who you are. Your love is no less because of who you love. This bill is a significant step towards equality. This bill is a significant step towards eliminating discrimination against LGBTIQ Australians. But there are still more steps we must take. The freedom to marry will soon be legislated, but there are still far too many workplaces where LGBTIQ Australians suffer from discrimination. Too many young gay people are bullied at school and bullied on sporting fields simply because of who they are, the way they talk or the way they look. The task for us all is to eliminate discrimination. The task for us all is to foster greater inclusion of LGBTIQ Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to close by sharing a very personal story. Earlier this year I became a grandmother for the first time, and my granddaughter's name is Camille. She of course has been a peaceful eruption of joy and love in our world. And this, like most big moments in your life, causes you to reflect—to reflect on the kind of place you want to leave behind for future generations. With the passage of this bill, young Australians growing up today will have the freedom to choose to marry the person that they love. It's a future that has been a long time coming, but, in the end, love and the campaign for equality will win.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:02</span>):  Some would suggest that opposition to same-sex marriage revolved around morality. But I've got to say that, for many people around this country who voted no, that wasn't the issue. The issue for them was freedom. The issue for me was about freedom and the protection of freedoms in this country if we have a change to the law such as this. It's not about morality for me or for most other people.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've never pretended to be a paragon of virtue. I'm a Christian, but I've fallen short of the mark, like so many other Christians. In my past, I lived, unmarried, with a girl for many years. So I'm not going to get up on my high horse and moralise to other people. I've been to wild bucks parties; I've been out on nights with uni mates, to places where good Christians shouldn't go—I've done all of that. So I'm not going to get up and lecture other people. I haven't lived a saintly life. The saint I come closest to is Augustine, who had a great prayer: 'O Lord, grant me chastity—but not yet.' So I am not here to moralise. I'll save that for the pulpit.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a conservative politician, and I care about freedoms. And that's what I want to talk about tonight, because, while I accept that there is broad support in the Australian populace for changing the definition of marriage, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 does pose a challenge for freedom, and particularly for freedom of religion, freedom of faith, freedom of worship, freedom of speech and freedom of conscience—all of these key freedoms. And I've got to say that millions of people cast their vote against same-sex marriage because they were concerned about these freedoms potentially being lost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm talking about the right of churches, synagogues, mosques and temples to stand up for, stand by and articulate their religion's articles of faith without fear of penalty and without fear of censorship. I'm talking about the same right for pastors, for priests and for ministers of religion to do likewise; for the businesses and services that those religions run; and for the right of faith based charities and organisations also to articulate their faith's values and to ensure that their employees, their services, their goods and whom they provide those to conform with those values. It is the right of any person of faith, I've got to say, to express their values and to live by them authentically. I include in that those who do run businesses, and also employees, without fear of being shut down, or being sacked or dismissed, or being hauled before some government tribunal. It is the right of parents to actually have a say in what is taught in the classroom regarding sexuality, marriage and relationships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a supporter of the plebiscite itself, I said from the get-go that I would not vote against the wishes of my electorate. It was a very specific statement. My electorate voted 55 per cent in favour of changing the definition of marriage to enable people of the same sex to be married under law. But that does mean that nine out of 20 people in my electorate had those concerns about freedom, concerns that I stated before: freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of faith and freedom for parents to determine what happens with their child's education regarding matters of gender, sexuality and marriage. I'm sure that most of those nine out of 20 individuals in my electorate would, like me, accept the fact that the majority have spoken: the majority want a change to the definition of marriage in the Marriage Act to enable people of same sex to marry. However, I think that they would also be likely to say that protections for key freedoms need to be built into the bill that is before us today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am more than willing to support this bill if key protections are put in place in this bill. Key protections must be put in place in this bill. I heard the speaker before, and I've heard many other speakers who have stood up and have ridiculed those protections. They've ridiculed them as going back to some era of ultradiscrimination where we can refuse service to people simply because they're same-sex attracted. No-one is talking about that. In fact, none of the amendments that are before us today are talking about that. I actually think that businesses should be able to refuse service for same-sex marriages, but that's not an amendment before us today. I've got to say that refusing service for a same-sex marriage is very, very different to refusing service to someone because they're gay. Refusing service to an individual because of who they are is very different to refusing service for a particular event which you might not be able to be part of because of your faith.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I am more than willing to support this bill if key protections are put in place. I am actually stunned that there are those in this parliament who support redefining marriage and who are opposed to putting these safeguards in this bill. That actually says something. I know that we have had an announcement by the government that there is going to be a former member of this place heading a review on this issue, the issue of religious liberty, when it comes to this matter and other matters. But that is a promise on the never-never that I cannot be certain of when I am asked to vote on this bill. This bill, I know, is going to have grave issues for freedom of speech, for freedom of faith, for freedom of conscience and for parents' rights to actually determine what goes on with their child's education on this matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were told by those running the 'yes' campaign that these concerns for freedom were a furphy. They said that they were side issues, that they were issues that would not eventuate should same-sex marriage become law. If that were the case, I would have to ask why there is any concern for putting these protections for key freedoms into this bill. I do happen to have a quote here from the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, about the so-called freedoms that are in the bill before us, not the amendment. He says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Lame proposals to protect ministers of religion and places of worship offer no protection to the 99.9% of religious believers who are not clergy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is imperative that our political leaders enact laws that protect the rights of all, religious believers included.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is great truth to that. It's great that we are actually protecting the freedom of churches and pastors to do what they want to do within their own worship spaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I have got to tell you about other countries where same-sex marriage has been legalised—I look at Denmark and I look at Sweden as examples. In Denmark, for example, the government of the day back in 2012 changed the law to say that pastors and ministers of the Church of Denmark must actually perform same-sex marriages. They must perform same-sex marriages or, if they want to object, they need to refer to a pastor who will perform the marriage within that church. I have to say that the law there has clamped down to erode that last right and now, basically, they have to perform it. It is the same in the Church of Sweden. This year the Prime Minister in Sweden said that all pastors in the Church of Sweden must perform same-sex marriages. So, when you have an example of two countries overseas where these protections for churches and pastors have not lasted, you have to say, 'What hope is there for anyone else?' That is why these protections that we are talking about are needed today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had many cases overseas. The UK Charity Commission removed the charitable status of 19 Catholic adoption and foster agencies because they did not want to adopt or foster to same-sex couples. In New Zealand a charity by the name of Family First has been deregistered because it was committed to traditional marriage, which was no longer considered a public benefit. In Johns v Derby City Council in 2011, the English High Court supported a council decision that a Christian couple with traditional views on marriage who had successfully fostered many, many children would not make suitable foster carers anymore because they were not open to promoting or accepting a same-sex-attracted lifestyle. I have got to say that the list could go on and on and on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have our own examples in this country. The Catholic Archbishop of Hobart, Julian Porteous, was dragged before the Tasmanian antidiscrimination commission because he dared to tell Catholic Church teaching on marriage to Catholic school students. Why was he put before that tribunal for that? Could it happen again? Will it happen again? Probably even more under these laws. We need these protections in place to stop that from happening. It is clear that it already can happen in this country. It will happen more if we pass this bill without these key protections in place. We had that 18-year-old girl, Madeline, here in Canberra, who posted something on social media in support of the 'no' campaign and, as a result, her contract with her employer, Capital Kids Parties, was cancelled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need protections in place for people of faith who want to express an opinion on this not to be sacked or have their contracts cancelled, which is a fundamental breach of an international human right. Look it up in the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Your ability to express your faith and to live out your faith is a core human right in that document. Today or this week, if we do not put these protections for freedom in here, we will see that whittled away in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will end with a letter that I received from a grandmother in my electorate of Dawson. She comes from Andergrove. She said to me, 'Unless there are adequate safeguards in place, you are legislating towards the inevitability of heavy fines and even imprisonment for Australians, as has been shown to be the case in other nations who have gone down this track.' I couldn't say it any more succinctly. Please, please, I beg the other members of this chamber: I am willing and there are many others here who are willing to vote for this bill to enable the majority decision to be ratified in this place, but we are asking for protections. We are asking for protections around key freedoms: freedom of speech, freedom of faith, freedom of conscience, and the right of parents to determine how their children are educated in these matters. It is not a very big ask. I would say to members that we can do this. We can tick off what the majority have asked for in this country while accommodating, recognising and respecting the views of the minority. It is before this parliament to do it, and I would encourage every member to vote for the amendments that are going to be put up to this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  My boy Paddy is a typical 10-year-old in most respects. He loves his mum and argues with his dad about the amount of time he spends playing computer games. He is desperately looking forward to the end of school in two weeks time. Of course I am proud of him. But on the morning of 15 November he gave me one more reason to be proud of him. After breakfast, he asked me, 'Can I call Raf?' Raf is Paddy's best mate. They do Cubs and they do circus and they do drama and they do just about everything else they can together. These are new millennial kids so a phone call to them means Facetime or Skype. When he managed to pull Raf up on the iPad, he saw his face and he said to him, 'Are you nervous?' 'A little bit', replied the boy at the other end of the iPad. 'I just want to wish you good luck,' said Paddy. As Raf said 'thanks', his mums' faces appeared behind him on the iPad. 'We are nervous and a little bit excited too,' they said. 'We have been baking rainbow cakes all morning to burn up the nervous energy.' It was eight o'clock; there were two hours to go. As I walked Paddy to school that morning I told him he would remember this day, as I had remembered other important milestones from my childhood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not often in the life of a statistician that they appear on television. It is even less frequent that the report from a statistician is prime-time viewing on every broadcast network in the country. In fact, if the international society of statisticians have got a record book, I am certain that David Kalisch smashed every record for the attention he received at 10 o'clock on that morning of 15 November. I want to congratulate him and his staff for the great work they have done in conducting the survey. When he revealed the result of the $100 million vote, there was no room for doubt; over 61 per cent of Australians had voted in favour and a majority was enjoyed in every state and in 133 of 150 electorates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Raf and his parents could celebrate. My family would celebrate. It was a momentous occasion. For Raf and his family, it sent a powerful message: your family is not second class. To the young boys and girls who are struggling with their identity, we have sent them a very powerful message too: it is okay being just who you are. This is something worth celebrating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the first time that I have spoken on a bill for marriage equality. My first year in this place, 2010, seems so long ago. I spoke on a motion in support of consulting our electorates on the very question. At that time I observed that the real objection to same-sex marriage was not to marriage itself but to the relationship. I still think that's true. The motion was the first important step in the House making its journey towards this debate today. I remember at the time when the member for Wentworth opposed it he wasn't alone. In February 2012 I moved a private member's bill for marriage equality. The bill was to give effect to Labor's national platform. In that speech I said that I believe that God made us all equal but different, not differently equal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Forty-two members voted in favour of the bill. There were no coalition MPs amongst them. It was of course a much more controversial matter back then, even within my own party. And in my own branches there were threats against sitting members such as me who'd taken a stand on the matter. I say to those coalition MPs who have taken the journey inside their own party, I congratulate you. I want to take the opportunity to single out the member for Gippsland and the member for Leichhardt today. These are members like me from regional seats where it was thought that the call for equality was less strong than it is in the inner cities. Of course, that's wrong. I'm pleased to say that those threats of political reprisals have now turned into vocal support within the party, within the electorate and now within this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People have changed their minds. For me, the journey was a short one. I don't pretend to be an early advocate on this issue. But, when I applied the same Labor principles of equality and fairness that I would to any other issue, there was only one possible answer. The Prime Minister and many of his colleagues, and many of mine, like millions of other Australians, have changed their minds, too. And this is a good thing. The arguments of some of the opponents in my early days made it easier. I'll never forget being told that God would punish both me and my children for taking a stand in favour of marriage equality. Clearly this is not a God that I or the majority of people of faith would recognise, but over the course of the last five years many abhorrent things have been said in their name.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Whitlam, 62.3 per cent of people voted yes. There was a great turnout. It surprised me. Over 80 per cent of residents participated in the survey. I want to talk about regional electorates. There are 150 seats in the federal parliament, with 88 of those classified as metropolitan and a further 62 as regional or rural. Of the 150 seats, only 17 voted against marriage equality. If you applied the common prejudice that says that regional folk are less progressive on issues like this than are their city cousins, you'd conclude that the city overwhelmingly voted in favour and the regions overwhelmingly voted against. Well, you'd be wrong. Of the 62 regional seats, only three voted against marriage equality. This confounds those views that regional Australia is somehow less progressive on these sorts of issues and less welcoming of diversity than people in the inner cities. Regional electorates like mine have shown themselves to be open places that are willing to embrace same-sex couples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the start of this process I called on regional Australia to embrace this opportunity to show Australia that we embrace and celebrate all our citizens. I'm really pleased that the people of regional Australia have answered that call. I want to pay tribute to some of the campaigners. Sometime in the future the majority of Australians are going to look back and they're going to look at the passage of these laws as somehow inevitable. So much of what we look at now as inevitable we also think of as easily won. This was neither.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been many tributes given to members and senators who have been instrumental in today's proceedings—from my own side, Senators Wong and Pratt and the members for Maribyrnong, Grayndler, Sydney and Port Adelaide. And we have just heard a fine speech from the member for Jagajaga. There wasn't a dry eye in the House when we heard the member from Barton contribute to this debate earlier today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to give a special shout-out to the 'yes' movement. It was Ashley Hogan, one of the courageous LGBTI senior staff and a longstanding campaigner on the issue—within the campaign she was known as the 'clearance unicorn'—who shouldered the load of both quality control for the campaign and coordinating responses to the public. Most campaigns have entire departments of people who do this. It was Ashley and her team of dedicated volunteers who performed it during this campaign, and they deserve our sincere thanks. There was Joe Scales, campaign adviser and rising young union leader, who used up weeks of leave to volunteer his formidable skills to the campaign. There were Georgia Kriz and Audrey Marsh, the New South Wales field directors, two talented young leaders who were guided by the formidable Patrick Batchelor, who was the national field director. But there were plenty of others who came before them. In 1979 an Illawarra based MP, George Petersen, an early mentor of mine, introduced a private member's bill into the New South Wales parliament to remove from the criminal statutes a whole heap of crimes that were directed at homosexual activity. I pay tribute to the early efforts of those early pioneers—George Petersen and those who supported him.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to pay tribute to some of the community advocates. I see Shelley Argent from PFLAG up in the Speaker's gallery. Shelley has run a fantastic campaign on this issue on behalf of the parents and friends of people who are lesbian and gay. I pay tribute to Rodney Croome, who I met years ago in a leaders forum long before I ever thought I would join this place, for his tireless work. In my own region, there was Illawarra Rainbow Labor. I want to recognise Caitlin Roodenrijs and my dear friend Simon Zulian, who dedicated his tireless campaign work to his deceased partner, Kane—the love of his life who he never had the opportunity to marry. I salute you, Simon, for your tremendous work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many members who have spoken in this debate and who have opposed marriage equality have now sought to amend the bill to protect what they see as an erosion of religious freedom. I support religious freedom, but it is not unqualified. I do not support the proposed amendments, which are solutions to imagined problems. The amendments to permit same-sex marriage do not require a religious organisation to solemnise marriages that are not consistent with its faith. There has, for the most part, been a healthy dialogue during this debate between faith based organisations and the parliament on this matter. The churches have been very forthcoming in their advocacy for the status quo. This is their right. It is also the right of parliamentarians to speak frankly and to offer advice to faith based organisations. It is something that I do now. Instead of pursuing an exemption to the general law under the apprehension that a special right or protection is needed, a better course of action might be to take some time to reflect upon your own beliefs and the operation of this law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many in the community who quite rightly ask of my own church, 'If marriage is such a central institution to our society, why don't your priests and brothers marry?' There are many instances where the changes in the law have affected the way that churches and other religious organisations have conducted the rites of marriage. I will give a few examples. It is no longer necessary that a minister of religion ask for a certificate from the Protector of Aborigines to conduct a marriage between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is no longer permissible for a minister of religion to solemnise a marriage of people as young as 12 or 13. In my grandparents' days, this was allowed. It is now against the law. I cite these examples to make the point that marriage has changed over time and so can churches' and religious organisations' views of marriage. Since the 16th century we have used the image of Lady Justice with a sword and scales but also a blindfold. When applying the law of justice, we are taught that justice is blind to the circumstances of the individual who stands before her. In this place, we make those laws and we strive to do so justly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I started with an observation of a conversation with my son, and this is where I would like to conclude. Like many members, I have young children. My two are aged 10 and 13. Like the statue of Lady Justice, I don't know today who they will fall in love with. I don't know whether they're going to be straight or gay. But I do know that, because of what we are doing today, the law shall not discriminate. If they decide to marry somebody who they truly love, who are we to stand in their way?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at the vote by parliamentary seats, 133 of the 150 federal electoral divisions recorded a majority 'yes' response. My own electorate of Canning, in Western Australia, recorded a 'yes' vote, with 60.2 per cent voting yes and 39.2 per cent voting no. I also note that 21.5 per cent of enrolled voters did not respond at all in Canning. Indeed, almost a quarter of my electorate remained silent on this question. So, I begin by acknowledging the clear victory won by those advocating for a 'yes' vote, and I congratulate them on their successful campaign.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For many gay Australians, this is a time of joy, celebration and fulfilment for them and for their families and friends, and I wish them every happiness. It is a moment made special because this social change does not draw its authority from above, but rather from below. The mandate for this change originates from our local communities all around Australia. This is important, as we organise ourselves in Australia from below, not from above. We organise ourselves in our immediate communities. We start with the family, and then we move out to our local municipalities, to our states, and then we come together as one country in our bond as the Commonwealth of Australia. Therefore, the postal survey has granted the change as both a cultural and a legal mandate. The Australian people have given us clear direction to legalise same-sex marriage. Now we must legislate for same-sex marriage, as this government has committed to doing so, with all Australians having had the opportunity to give voice to their convictions on this question. And I must say that it is an immense privilege to represent the people of Canning during the final stages of this process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been very clear with Canning electors about where I stand on the question of marriage. I have always held the position that marriage is a union between a man and a woman, entered into for life and to the exclusion of all others. My view on marriage is founded on religious conviction. I am a Christian, and I see marriage as a religious ordinance—an institution that is entered into before God. This is the orthodox position of the common historical tradition of Christianity held by many Australians across our vast continent. I affirm it and believe it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also recognise that man-woman marriage is an institution that is not strictly confined to Christianity or to Western civilisation. It has been present in every culture and religion throughout history. People of no faith at all hold to man-woman marriage as well. I acknowledge the culture of our Indigenous Australians, many of whom came together and signed the Uluru Bark Petition on 1 June 2015 in this House. Those Indigenous elders, whilst recognising that they do not speak for the entirety of their language groups or country, declared:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the union between man and women is deeply a part of our ancient and continuing culture across all of our communities, and that our Fathers and Mothers provide the foundation for those communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My point is very simple: man-woman marriage is common to all cultures, particularly to our First Australians. It is my view and the view of 4.87 million other Australians. It has endured because it is, indeed, beautiful, true and good. That is why I argued the 'no' case during the campaign and that is why I voted no in the postal survey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the people of Canning and of Australia have voted that the law should be changed to include same-sex couples in the institution of marriage, and I must respect that. That is why I have been clear with my electorate—since the 2016 federal election and several times since on the public record—that, in the event of a 'yes' vote in the postal survey, I will abstain from voting yes in the House. In other circumstances, I would vote against this bill, but I respect the will of my electors and the Australian people and I will not seek to vote it down. At the same time, I cannot go against my conscience on this question of marriage. This is why I will abstain. In the words of Christ, I must render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Individual conscience is central to my political vision. That is why I am a Liberal member of parliament. I believe in the freedom of conscience, speech, expression and association. They are the lifeblood of our Western democratic tradition. That is why I will defend the right of Labor MPs to vote with their conscience, against the wishes of their electorates. They must do what is right for them. I do, however, oppose the Labor Party binding their members to vote against amendments to this bill. This is nothing more than an attempt to wound this government and stymie our attempt to enhance and strengthen the Smith bill so that it protects all Australians, including those of religious faith.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people like to think that the idea of conscience exists on its own—that it is something that occurs naturally to our civilisation. I take the view of a Scottish theologian who once wrote that 'the great shadow on the conscience of the modern West is the shadow of the cross'. Christianity has had an outsized influence on the formation of our Australia—our culture, its norms and its institutions. That is not to say that we are a Christian nation, but we cannot ignore the marks of that tradition around us, from the prayers at the commencement of parliament to the preamble to our Constitution. Our entire of system of government, with all its attendant checks and balances, can be seen as a project to preserve and uphold the dignity and worth of the individual in Australia. The source of that project lies in the central tenets of Christianity—the profound idea that every person bears the mark of their maker and is worthy of respect. It is on that basis that we can disagree with one another and have a politics of compromise. This is never more important in an increasingly diverse nation, with many Australians practising religious faiths including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism and many others. We also have an increasing number of Australians who declare no religious faith at all. We are at a time in our history where we need to live alongside each other with greater understanding and empathy, particularly when we cannot agree. As Robert Menzies said in 1942:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are a diversity of creatures, with a diversity of minds and emotions and imaginations and faiths. When we claim freedom of worship we claim room and respect for all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of our great charities, hospitals, schools and local institutions—the ones that are formational in our lives and that sustain us at our lowest ebbs—are faith based and, indeed, many are Christian in character. Many of them, except for a few outliers, hold to the tenets of traditional Christian teaching, including that of marriage. They need room to teach, practise and live out their convictions without interference from the state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very concerned that the Smith bill does not protect those Australians who hold to a traditional definition of marriage, nor institutions of a religious character that hold the same. The Smith bill focuses exclusively on the wedding ceremony, while ignoring the larger reality that people of conscience and religious faith seek to live out their convictions on a daily basis. I, therefore, will be moving an amendment during the committee stage, a freedoms amendment, that seeks to safeguard sincere Australians who, for either religious or conscientious reasons, hold to a traditional view of marriage and associated beliefs on parenting and sexuality. This amendment will shield Australians who express such views—with the limitation that those views must not be hateful, harassing or threatening—from the vexatious misuse of state or territory anti-vilification laws. We have already seen the example of Tasmanian Archbishop Julian Porteous, who was targeted by a complainant and dragged before an antidiscrimination tribunal for doing no more than expressing the long-held position of the Catholic Church on marriage. This amendment will protect individuals like him who publicly express a view of traditional marriage from vexatious litigation. It is important to note that the shield will only be enlivened when people who hold a sincere and relevant belief in traditional marriage are attacked. It is not a sword to be wielded in the service of bigotry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment will also protect individuals and entities such as charities, schools and not-for-profits from discrimination because of a sincerely held belief in traditional marriage. It will protect them from detrimental treatment by a public authority, whether it is a Commonwealth, state or territory authority or a local government authority established by the Commonwealth, states or territories. This protection will prevent them from delicensing or defunding, as we have seen with universities, schools and charities in international jurisdictions that have legislated same-sex marriage. Importantly, it will allow faith-based schools to teach marriage and sexuality in accordance with their religious tradition without fear of detriment. It also respects the rights of parents to raise and educate their children in conformity with their moral and religious convictions. It will also allow parents to withdraw children from classes that do not accord with their beliefs on marriage. This amendment is designed to protect the 4.87 million Australians who voted to retain the traditional definition of marriage. It does not allow for discrimination or hate speech. Rather, it preserves conscience and religious freedom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to finish by acknowledging that I love my country and I want to see our democracy flourish into the future. This was a long process. It was hard for many people. But it has delivered change for those who sought it, and I respect that. And as Christmas comes ever closer, I'm reminded that we have great cause for optimism and hope—a hope that transcends this political sphere. I will continue to serve the people of Canning regardless of their sexuality, religion, gender or ethnicity, and it remains an honour to do so.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CLARE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:42</span>):  The last time we debated this issue here, I was about to get married. I said then that if my wife, Louise, and I had met in a different time in a different place, we might never have been able to get married. That is because my wife, Louise, is Vietnamese. Fifty years ago, interracial marriage was banned in most states in America. In most Australian states and territories for most of the 20th century, Indigenous and non-Indigenous people couldn't get married unless they had the special permission of a government official, usually called a 'protector'. In New South Wales until 1963, it was an offence for an Indigenous person and a non-Indigenous person to even live together. In South Africa, the first apartheid law passed in the forties was the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. When I think about this debate on marriage equality, I think about those old laws and how I'd feel if the law today said that I couldn't marry Louise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the weekend, I went back and read the judgement of the US Supreme Court that overturned the ban on interracial marriage in 1967. The case is called, quite fittingly, Loving v Virginia. Mildred Loving was a black woman. Richard Loving was a white man. They lived in Virginia. In 1958, they got married across the border in Washington DC. A couple of weeks later, back at home, police raided their house in the middle of the night, found them asleep in bed and arrested them. They were charged with the crime of miscegenation. Three months later, a Virginia court sentenced them to a year in jail. The sentence was suspended on the basis that they leave the state of Virginia. They did that, but they didn't give up. They fought all the way to the US Supreme Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It took almost a decade, but that fight changed the law in the United States and it changed the lives of countless Americans. Change like that doesn't just happen; it happens because of extraordinarily courageous people like Mildred and Richard Loving. When the Virginia Supreme Court rejected their appeal in 1965, they said it was because it was important to 'preserve the racial integrity of its citizens and prevent the corruption of blood and a mongrel breed of citizens'. Just imagine how those awful, hateful words must have felt to Mildred and Richard Loving.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 50 years after those words were written—by men on the other side of the world who are long since dead—they still affect me. They still make me angry and they still sting. What would those men who wrote those words think of my little baby boy, Jack, the most precious and important thing in Louise's and my lives? Louise and I and little Jack are lucky that we live in a different time. We don't talk about 'miscegenation' or 'mongrels' anymore. Thank goodness. Things have changed because of people like Mildred and Richard, and they keep changing. It's impossible to imagine us having a debate about whether two people of the same sex should be able to get married when Mildred and Richard were fighting for that same right 50 years ago. But we are having that debate today. Over the course of the last few months, gay and lesbian Australians have felt the same sting of other people's judgement of their relationships. They've suffered that for a long, long time, and particularly over the last few months as Australians cast their vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Out of this, though, has come a very clear message. Most Australians think same-sex couples should be able to do what Louise and I have done, what Mildred and Richard did 62 years ago, what most of us here have done, or will do, and what millions of Australians have done, some more than once—that is, get married. More than 61 per cent of Australians voted yes. In some parts of Australia it was very, very popular; in some parts, it wasn't. My electorate is one of those places. It recorded the highest no vote in the country. Some people were surprised by that; I've got to say I was not. I know my local community pretty well. I was born and raised in Western Sydney; I've lived there almost all my life. I always thought my electorate would record the highest no vote in Australia, and I've always been very up-front with them about my view. It's a socially conservative place full of a lot of wonderful people, a lot of people of faith, a lot of people from parts of the world where the idea of two people of the same sex getting married really is a foreign concept. And so the result didn't come as a shock.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the results of the survey were released, a number of people in the media and a number of people in my electorate have come to me and said, 'Are you going to vote no now because the community has?'—even though I voted yes five years ago when my friend and colleague Stephen Jones introduced a private member's bill and even though I voted yes in the survey. Voting yes isn't a popular thing to do in my neck of the woods—I know that—but if all you seek in this job is popularity then you're going to be constantly disappointed. As a member of parliament, you can never make everybody happy all the time. The best you can do is be up-front with people, be honest with people and be true to yourself. Ultimately in this job, it's yourself that you have to confront and, in the quiet moments, answer to. I don't like having a different view on this than my community. But if I voted no here, after everything I have said and everything that I believe in, I think I would be rightly criticised as a hypocrite, as someone who lacks character and courage when it counts. And that's not me—at least, it's not the politician and, more importantly, it's not the person that I aspire to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate knows what the sting of discrimination feels like. They experience it every day—some because of the hijab or the turban that they wear, or the beard on their face, and some just because their English isn't perfect. And when that happens I'll stand up and fight for them. I did it when Bronwyn Bishop tried to ban the burqa in the public gallery. I did it when this government tried to change the law to make it legal to offend, insult or humiliate someone based on the colour of their skin. I did it when they tried to change the law, only a few months ago, to stop people who don't have university-level English skills from becoming Australian citizens. And I'll keep doing it. I know there are some people who are concerned about what the impact of this legislation is going to be on their church or their mosque, their school or their faith, but it's important to know that nothing in this legislation changes the right of churches or mosques or religious schools to preach and teach their view of marriage. This happens today. It happens right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A good example is the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church, today, often refuses to marry people who have been divorced if they haven't had that previous marriage annulled. That's not consistent with the current Marriage Act. Catholic schools and charities don't lose funding today because of that. They're not breaking any law by preaching and teaching Catholic doctrine. And this legislation, this change to the Marriage Act, doesn't change that. But if there are gaps in the law to protect religious freedoms that are identified by the expert panel that the Prime Minister has set up, then I'll be arguing in my party that we should fix them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a time in Australia when being a Catholic meant you suffered terrible discrimination. For most of the first 32 years of convict settlement in Australia, Catholics were prohibited from even going to church. They couldn't hold a Catholic mass. There was a time in this country when, if you were a woman, you couldn't even vote. My great-great-grandmother has never cast a ballot. There was a time when Indigenous people weren't even counted as Aussies. There was a time when Indigenous Australians couldn't even get a drink at the pub. My grandfather used to run pubs in country New South Wales. My mum grew up in them, and she told me a story the other day about her memories of her dad secretly serving Aboriginal customers out the back. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of the people that I have the privilege in this place to represent wouldn't even be here today if we hadn't got rid of another set of discriminatory laws, some of the most odious policies ever conceived by this place—the White Australia policy. We used to think it was okay, though. We used to think it was all right to discriminate against people based upon their sex or their religion or the colour of their skin. We don't now. We treat people equally, or at least we try to. And we're a better country because of it. That, for me, is what this debate is all about: equality. Equality before the law—giving every Australian the same opportunities in life that I have, whether that's the right to vote, the right to practise your religion, the right to drink in the same pub or the right to marry the person you love.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:52</span>):  The issue, of course, before the House is how society should define marriage, and that issue is as complicated as it is old. There is an image I recall vividly and, likely, will do for some time. It was the sight of a Neolithic man and woman—roughly 5,800 years old—arms and legs interlocked in an embrace, which, all these thousands of years later, is recognisably tender. That image brings to mind a pivotally important truth about marriage, that the institution is beyond ancient. It is probably fair to say that almost as early as there were such things as sentient beings that we would regard as human, those humans had been seeking someone to share their lives with, pairing for support, for comfort and to build and care for families. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not that marriage reduces down to how unpleasant we humans have found being alone. Much less shamefully, I think it boils down to the fact that human life has traditionally been so difficult and so full of tragedy that we have found a great truth in living—that hard, individual lives are improved by the finding of a greater strength and resilience in sharing life's tragedies than is ever attainable from living and dying as creatures of solitude. In my mind's eye, I see that Peloponnesus image preserving, with remarkable dignity, the final moments of a couple that held each other in their arms. Whatever their fate was, and however hard and likely cruel their lives were in what they endured, they had each other right to the end. Most things about the lives of that couple we'll never know, but we can assume with safety that their lives were hard, much harder than ours. It's no stretch to note how in the great sweep of human history life was, in the whole, generally full of want and tragedy and very often unimaginably violent. Also, it's far from a stretch to conceive of this ancient couple as married to each other. This is because marriage is so ancient that it predates written history or even writing itself. The instinct and want to couple is likely as old as the instinct to use tools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while the couple I have in my mind's eye may have been the subject of only the humblest ceremonial recognition of their existence as a couple, they may well have made a commitment to each other every bit as real and human as the commitments that we now as moderns make governed by law and sanctioned in different ways by various religions both new and old.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Being a construct of such antiquity, marriage in its practice has always evolved. For a great part of human history, the practical considerations of alliances and intertribal arrangements dominated the reasons for marriage, but over time the marriage of reasons has been replaced by the marriage of emotions. Alain de Botton described modern marriage in the following way:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Marriage: a hopeful, generous, infinitely kind gamble taken by two people who don't know yet who they are or who the other might be, binding themselves to a future they cannot conceive of and have carefully omitted to investigate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For all its changeability, the reason for its endurance is that marriage is driven not ultimately by reasons but by a fundamental human emotion: the want to conquer life's challenges by sharing its burdens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Marriage predates governments and it predates organised religion. In fact, I suspect that the instinct for humans to want to couple is as old and as fundamentally defining of humanity as the instinct to use tools. In fact, it may be even older than the instincts for religion or art. Religion adopted and synthesised marriage so that it has become critically inseparable from many religions' theology, and that is the reason why extra protections for religion should accompany this bill, but neither governments nor churches can lay claim to inventing or owning marriage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the most thoroughly and fundamentally human of institutions, only people own marriage and only people can adapt and evolve the institution in a durable way. That evolution in Western nations has wisely been, in the last several hundred years, undertaken slowly and with due and proper care, reflecting the institutions' fundamental influence on our way of life. The plebiscite that we have all experienced was not just an extraordinary democratic event; it was the eventual form of a democratic event that was absolutely necessary to make durable and make acceptable this change to our most fundamental of institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The foundational nature of marriage and the wide divergence of strongly held opinions about its proper form meant that a vote, a referendum, a plebiscite, a mass democratic movement—whatever you want to call it, however it was ultimately constituted—was always going to be the best and likely only way to settle this dispute in a broadly acceptable form to be enduring. The simple fact is that the party that was to facilitate this bill being brought before this House in a way that could secure its sustainable passage into law was always going to need the clearest authority of the people that truly own the institution of marriage. If this change, this progress, could have been easily achieved without an underpinning, direct democratic mandate—if it could have been simply achieved by parliamentary vote held without this foundation—then why did Labor not achieve that progress when they were in office for six years?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Opposition to a plebiscite itself is not beyond understanding. But I think that that opposition is made worthy of serious scrutiny by virtue of the efforts of many members opposite who became opponents of a plebiscite and who now characterise themselves as the chief architects of change. What should not pass without mention is that, when the coalition did take the risk of advancing this issue to a durable resolution by committing itself to a fair and broad democratic mechanism—a democratic process that was absolutely necessary to actually get this issue resolved—some Labor members did not merely oppose that democratic process but did so with a vigour that we rarely see in this place. They argued the debate would be intemperate, and the wild irony was that they put this argument in the most blisteringly intemperate way. There is no avoiding now the fact that Labor carefully cast predictions of rampant, widespread hate, chaos and harm, and that those predictions now look utterly absurd. The reality was that the generally civil, fair and temperate way the plebiscite was conducted merely displayed that excessive, intemperate activism is no more enlivened in debates to do with sexuality than it is, sadly, enlivened in any number of other issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Excessive activism on any issue is a sad reality and a fixture of some democracies. It should be called out and decried wherever its ugly head is raised, but its mere existence should never be a reason to not have a public debate, because that would be its ultimate victory. Far worse than the absurd predictions of calamitous, widespread hate with a calculated effort to undermine what now, clearly, was the necessary democratic path forward is by characterising the process as rigged. The member for Isaacs said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This entire rigged exercise is designed to divide Australia and to encourage hateful words and arguments in order for the 'no' case to win.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that the plebiscite was a conspiracy designed to rig a no vote is utterly absurd. Those statements were ridiculous before the outcome but, in the face of the actual outcome, they should be called out for the utter nonsense that they were. In fact, rarely has a conspiracy theory been proved so wrong in the outcome than that absolute howler from the member for Isaacs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over many years, there has been great effort to recast important progressions in Australian society as the exclusive province of Labor politics. It is often a surprise, particularly to young Australians, to learn that important social progressions were the result and actions of conservative governments. It was this side of politics that took on evergreen risks and the tough grinding work of advancing and making real, important policy changes to eliminate prejudice. It was a coalition government that abolished the White Australia policy and the same government that delivered the seminal 1967 referendum to include Indigenous Australians more completely in our nation. The modern rewriting of political history is perhaps most remarkable now for how quickly it occurs, so let's start by getting the history right, right from the start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The plebiscite was an outstanding civil success of a truly voluntary democratic process. The coalition made a clear assessment that a plebiscite was critical to both parties and this chamber in being able to craft a broadly acceptable and enduring change to a foundation institution in our society. The coalition government, against enormous opposition, made the plebiscite happen and work. That the process was bitterly opposed by progressive politicians who themselves failed to progress the issue over their six long years, when they had their chance to do so, is now an undeniable fact. The Leader of the Opposition said about the plebiscite: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They have stacked the deck against young people, against expats, against Australians who support equality … The opponents of marriage equality have set this process up to fail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It did not fail; it succeeded thoroughly, brilliantly and fairly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The dictum made living by John F. Kennedy that success has a thousand fathers and failure is an orphan has never been truer than on the night of the plebiscite result. Some of the many people who celebrated the result of the process were people who did everything within their power to stop the process that brought us to this very point in this chamber right now. They said it was stacking the decks against young people. They said it was set up to bring about failure. They said it was rigged in order for the no case to win. The opposition leader said, 'I hold the PM responsible for every hurtful bit of filth this debate will unleash.' What the debate actually unleashed was the democratic will of the Australian people. It is a case study in the way the world's greatest democracy devised the best and most temperate way to resolve the most emotional, delicate and difficult of issues, and the progress that it catalysed is what the Prime Minister is responsible for. That is the legacy of this government and this coalition, and as we now head to consider amendments there are several protecting religious freedoms that I consider worthy of support, and I will be free to support them if I wish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members opposite, who may hold similar views to mine, will be gagged and bound in a collective exercise which will limit their conscience and free choice on this issue. The fundamental fact will always stand: Labor's role in the foundation of this progress was to oppose the critical democratic process that enabled it. The progress that we are now all engaged in was, in the ultimate event, achieved by this coalition for the simple reason that we trusted the Australian people, and in the face of overwhelming political and media criticism we made sure that their say was had.</span>

                    <a href="193430" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WATTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:05</span>):  I want to begin my remarks tonight by saying to all LGBTI Australians that I'm sorry. I'm sorry that the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 took so long. Every day that a person is forced to live in our society with lesser rights than their neighbour is an injustice. We perpetuated and perpetrated an injustice on LGBTIQ Australians for far, far too long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is right that the parliament will this week vote to extend equality before the law to LGBTIQ couples and their families. It is right that elected members of this place will vote to afford the most basic of dignities to LGBTIQ Australians: the recognition that their relationships are just as loving, that their relationships are just as meaningful and that their relationships are just as committed as anyone else's.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sorry, too, for what this parliament put LGBTIQ Australians through to get to this vote. I take responsibility for the inaction of previous Labor governments on this issue during our time in office, recognising the efforts of the member for Whitlam in introducing the 2012 marriage equality private member's bill and the 42 members of parliament, including the Leader of the Opposition, who voted for it. I recognise also the extraordinary work of people like Senator Penny Wong, who worked assiduously within party forums for many years to change Labor Party policy on this issue so that when marriage equality passes in this parliament this week it will do so with more votes from the Labor Party than any other party—but recognising our responsibility for failing to get it done in the past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sorry that LGBTIQ Australians were forced by this parliament to submit themselves, to submit their rights as equal members of our society, to a national public debate and opinion poll before we could get them to this point in this place. For these reasons, while I'm glad to be able to vote for this bill, I cannot take joy from it. Historians will note the public celebrations following the announcement of the results of this survey, celebrations that the Prime Minister had the good sense to realise that he would not be welcome at. But, in doing so, they will miss a deeper truth of this period in our history. Australians who support justice, equality and human dignity celebrated this result because the alternative would have been unimaginably painful. We celebrate it because a process that inflicted totally unnecessary pain and suffering on LGBTIQ Australians and their families would have re-traumatised these Australians had the result been in the negative. We celebrate it because the next generation of LGBTIQ kids will not have to go through a similar national debate on the worth of themselves and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But these celebrations obscured the hurt, confusion and anxiety that I saw my LGBTIQ friends and family had been put through in this ghoulish process. History should record the repulsion that many of us felt at seeing the Prime Minister take credit for these celebrations while denying the suffering that he chose to inflict on LGBTIQ Australians and their families. I want to give these deeply mixed feelings a voice in this debate today. To this end I want the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> to record for posterity the reflections of a comedian who I admire, Rebecca Shaw, and her experience of this process. Bec wrote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I thought that hearing that the Yes side had won would make me feel happy; that perhaps the months of tension and anger that had built up in my body would dissipate. But the instant I heard those words, I felt my stomach knot further. I turned to my group, more subdued than most of the people around me. I hugged my friends, holding on quietly and for a long time. One looked at me from under her glasses; her face was solemn, but I saw tears streaming down her face. Another was shaking their head angrily. Around me, people were smiling and hugging; … I saw an old couple embrace tearfully. I cried a bit, then – how could I not? But the knot didn't budge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't speak on the perspective of an LGBTIQ person myself, but I can feel this knot in my stomach in this debate today, and I could feel it coming in the lead-up to the results.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I knew I wouldn't be in the mood to celebrate on the day of the results, so I had accepted an invitation to speak at the graduation ceremony of my old high school on the day before. I was optimistic for my old school in regional Queensland, in Toowoomba, which, it was clear to me, was far more enlightened today than it was when I was there 20 years ago. The school now had LGBTIQ kids and transitioning kids, things that were simply denied when I was at the school. But my optimism turned to bitterness when, watching the results, a 'no' result was returned for the seat of Groom in the survey. I felt for those kids as the 'no' result was returned. How did this unnecessary public process of judgement make them feel, this public confirmation of their worst fears about the community that they lived in? What message does this send to an LGBTIQ kid in that community?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear we still have a long path to walk to ensuring that all LGBTIQ Australians throughout our country are afforded recognition as fully equal members of our society. For those who inflicted this process on Australia, I can only express my hope that future governments have the good sense and the political courage not to let it loose on the human rights of other groups. Regardless, the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party will have to live with the question of why they forced LGBTIQ Australians to submit their rights, their equality as citizens, to a national debate when no other race or religious group has been forced to do the same without constitutional requirement. This is the Prime Minister's legacy in this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of us in this place should make amends for the way that we have failed LGBTIQ Australians leading up to this bill by ensuring that we do not perpetrate similar injustices in future, that we do not commit similar failures of empathy. The relationships of future generations of LGBTIQ Australians won't be subject to legal discrimination, but we will need to continue to ensure that they do not confront social and other forms of discrimination. The reactionaries in our society who seek to exploit and accentuate anxieties about people who are perceived to be different will move on to a new target.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliament and the public have so clearly rejected homophobia. The tiny minority of people who think that religion is like a toy plastic sheriff's badge to wave at other people rather than a source of personal moral reflection will be tutting their fingers at someone else soon enough. Indeed, it is clear from the way that the 'no' campaign desperately tried to make the marriage equality survey about anything other than marriage between LGBTIQ Australians that the reactionaries have already chosen their new target—trans kids. The disgracefully dishonest and fact-free campaign against the Safe Schools program comprehensively detailed by Ben Law in his tour de force quarterly essay is a sign of things to come on this front. So, to the MPs who are professing to a Damoclean conversion on marriage equality and recognising the equal human dignity of gay and lesbian Australians in the chamber this week: I implore you not to make the same mistake over again with trans Australians. To the trans Australians and their families watching this debate with trepidation, I want to say that I see you and I will not abandon you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a few happier words to end on. I want to thank and pay tribute to all of the campaigners who ensured that Australia said yes in this survey. Thank you to The Equality Campaign, Australians for Marriage Equality, GetUp! and the Australian trade union movement, particularly the Victorian Trades Hall Council. I want to particularly acknowledge the work of a constituent of mine, Wil Stracke, who led the trades hall campaign and acquired the most famous fence in Australia in the process. Your mum would have been proud, mate. Also I want to thank Raymond Pham for coordinating my office's 'yes' campaign in Gellibrand. In a perfect world, we could have done without their good deeds, but we are thankful for them regardless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to thank all of those LGBTIQ Australians who lost people that they loved during the long, long wait for this day. When the Western Bulldogs won the flag after a 62-year drought, one of the most common things that I heard at the family day at Whitten Oval the day after the premiership was people wishing that they could have shared this long-anticipated moment of happiness with a loved one who never got to see the day. Lovers, family and friends will be feeling the same way about the vote in this parliament: lovers who never got to propose to the person they love; parents who never got to walk their child down the aisle; children who didn't have a parent there to walk them down the aisle; and friends who never believed that this day of equality would come. The happiness of the breakthrough moment after so long makes the feeling of these losses freshly painful. Many people in the LGBTIQ community and their family members will be feeling this way at the moment. I know I'm feeling this way. I'm thinking of those members of my family who are in the same boat.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:16</span>):  Since 2013 the issue of marriage equality has been of significance in one way or another in Gilmore. I have a number of friends who maintain same-sex relationships, some of whom have been supportive of the yes campaign as it evolved and others who said they didn't need a piece of paper to acknowledge their love for each other. In addition to that, I have other friends whose religious beliefs prevent them from accepting the need for or the validity of such relationships and others who, for no other reason than family tradition, are more supportive of the no aspect of the marriage equality debate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2013, I truly believed that Gilmore was a fairly evenly divided electorate on this issue. Over time, I have seen the acceptance level grow. Initially, there was absolutely no appetite for a plebiscite from some parts of the electorate. There were gay marriage forums and the emotions were running high. I attended one of these, in particular, and Robbie and Shirley sat with me as they understood that this was not going to be an easy solution. They knew of the general community sentiment and they also knew I cared for them in their relationship. I had a questionnaire for the electorate, but then the decision was made to have a plebiscite, which eventually became the postal survey. The boundaries of my electorate changed so the result of the survey didn't even reflect the sentiment of the new voters, who I hoped to represent. Over time, and especially with the gentle and persuasive efforts of Dawn Hawkins, who happens to be here, from Marriage Equality Gilmore, there was a move in the community to social acceptance. Finally, on 15 November, the result was announced for Gilmore for the postal vote and the numbers reflected almost the same percentages as the national vote, around 80 per cent turnout, with around 62 per cent voting yes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For many months, I have committed to the people of Gilmore that whatever they voted was the vote I would carry into the House of Representatives. So I reaffirm here that when the votes are counted, I will be voting yes. I am, however, very aware that 38 per cent of those who voted ticked the box marked 'no' on their survey. Dawn and I have had conversations as to how best move to move forward with everyone, knowing that their rights and freedoms are protected, and that truly means everyone. We will progress quietly, steadily and with all of the respect we have for everyone's point of view.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to report here on some excerpts from emails from Gilmore residents that both inspire me and make me proud for the way everyone treated this issue. In the previous years, the emails were not quite as balanced or as pleasant to read. Dianne and Neville wrote:</span>

Unfortunately, I now feel disheartened regarding the prospect of marrying Paula any time soon. I still feel strongly that we should be able to refer to our life-long commitment as 'marriage' rather than an alternative reference that is solely for same-sex commitments. This would make us feel that our relationship is normal, equal and accepted by society.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, by email over a number of different messages, I learned a little about Kate and her wife, Tara.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We believe, first and foremost, that marriage must be defined as that between a man and a woman, without any alternative, for marriage to be marriage.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you are listening to or reading my words, then you will know that this was a difficult issue for Gilmore as a whole. There have been a number of key influencers, and I thank each and every one of them: Peter Pilt, for his continual spiritual guidance; my political mentors John Bennett and Jo Gash; Dawn Hawkins, for her gentle and persuasive efforts in the community; Robbie, Shirley and the girls, who have stood by me this entire time; my mates Albert and Tim, who are Latin dancers extraordinaire; Paul and Jason; Deb and Kim, strong women who are leaders in their respective fields; and all the residents who have written with respect on this issue, for they helped shape opinions. It is my deepest wish that whatever our differences we continue to respect each other's choices and live our lives according to the best of our collective principles and values.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:22</span>):  The marriage equality postal survey asked just one question: 'Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?' The Central Coast said yes, and very soon I will vote yes. As an individual and a friend and supporter, with a strong belief in equal rights, I believe this change has been a long, long struggle. I am someone who has worked in mental health for 15 years and witnessed the effect of inequality on individuals in the LGBTIQ community and those they love. This change must happen.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Much has been said in this debate, and the time I have I am giving to my friend Josh, who has travelled from the Central Coast to be here today. Many people know Josh as a producer, director and one of the driving forces behind our dynamic youth theatre company Jopuka Productions. Josh's passion is to tell other people's stories, in their words, to give young people on the Central Coast, in our community, a voice and for our local stories to be heard. Now, with his permission, I'm going to tell Josh's story, in his own words. Josh has two mums—his birth mother and her partner of 15 years. In 2011, after several years fostering two girls, they became one of the first same-sex couples to adopt in New South Wales. Joshua says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">You've re-created what I lived as a young child, however unwittingly, but this time you've placed it inside an envelope and stuck it in every mailbox, and there are going to be gaybies going to school over the coming months who will be subjected to the same bullying, incubated with the same warped access to the debate, that the kids at my primary school had.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Sadly some will say this letter provides more evidence that gay people can't and shouldn't raise children, it does neither, it's not the children's fault, or the parents', or even the bullies'. It is yours, Prime Minister; you have opened the floodgates once more to an avalanche of hate, with what appears to be little thought to the people, especially the children, who are on the receiving end.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Josh says when he posted this letter online he didn't expect many people to see it. It reached over two million people. Unfortunately, the debate wasn't always respectful. Josh received several death threats. I have heard from people whose windows were broken, and whose letterbox was vandalised and stuffed with anonymous and vile letters because they put up a marriage equality poster. As Josh says, those people who did such things got a vote, too. It was an ordeal that so many should not have had to endure, but our community's voice has been heard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time to remove discrimination from the Marriage Act. I am proud to represent my community in this parliament and to support this bill on behalf of the 118,164 people on the Central Coast who, just like Josh, said yes to marriage equality. To those in my community who wrote to me or spoke to me about their concerns, I have listened. It is important to note that this bill both expands equality and protects religious freedoms. I am optimistic that all Australians will soon be able to marry the person they love in the country they love.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Josh's mums have been engaged for 13 years, but they have never allowed themselves to contemplate any serious wedding plans, wanting to wait for the law to be changed. But 15 November changed this mindset. While they haven't locked in a date, they finally have real grounds to look at plans seriously, knowing the law is days away from being changed. It's a time of tremendous joy within their immediate and extended family. This change is symbolic for Josh's mums in that it will celebrate not just their future but the past 15 years of partnership and combined love for their three children. I respect and admire gaybies like Josh for standing up for their parents' rights. I wish all rainbow families of the Central Coast and across Australia love and equality in the years to come. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUCHHOLZ</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:31</span>):  We all have landed in a spot, but not all of us have travelled on the same road to get here with regard to the marriage amendment debate that has landed. Before I start my commentary this evening, I want to acknowledge those who are here in the gallery—the dwindling mob who are here. They were strong in numbers earlier on this afternoon. I just want to acknowledge you for the longevity that you have shown in your commitment to this cause. I don't know if you're going to like what I'm going to say, but hopefully you'll applaud me! When I was in the Speaker's chair, I was instructed to throw you all out for clapping, because it's against the standing orders. But you clap as hard as you want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all travelled to this place from a different spot. I come from a strong conservative electorate—an area from the Gold Coast hinterland over to Toowoomba. It's predominantly a farming area, where old Germans and old Scots tilled the land—Protestants, Catholics, hardworking. It is generational; there are streets named after them, with those heritages. The largest contributor to GDP in my electorate is agriculture. They all go to church.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On every marriage bill that has come into this place—every marriage bill—I have voted no, and I've led the charge on it, because my party, as part of party policy, said that the traditional definition of marriage was that it was between a man and a woman. That was my position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I stood for preselection as an LNP candidate, I stood out in front and was asked questions by no less than 200 preselectors. There were seven other candidates looking to stand in my seat. One was an ex-minister of the Howard government. When asked what my position on marriage was going to be, I said that I would uphold the party position and that it would be that marriage was between a man and a woman.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a Catholic. I go to church. I have the fortunate privilege of catching up with the archbishop of our diocese occasionally. And, without telling you which diocese I'm in, he likes a scotch, and we will talk about these things. My Catholic priest in my electorate is a great mate of mine. When I'm getting communion, I ask him: 'Is the local Rugby League squad, the Fassifern Bombers, playing at home this weekend? If they are, come and pick me up after church. We'll go to the football. You drive my car; I will drink beer, and then you drop me home afterwards.' It's a great relationship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm in line with my party position. I'm in line with my church's position. What I'm not in line with is this. After the plebiscite, I'm not in line with the views of my greater constituency base. That has become the basis of my ethical dilemma. Who is my master? Is it my church and my God? And I've already established to you: they're great mates of mine. Is it the party to which I owe the privilege of being able to stand in this place? Are they my master?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight I had a phone hook-up with no fewer than 10 of my executives throughout my electorate. My electorate has an area of just under 8,000 square kilometres and is very diverse. We have branches and hierarchical structures, and I had 10 of them on the phone tonight. I sought their counsel and said: 'This is my ethical dilemma. Where do I land?' The results from my electorate of Wright were that we had a participation rate just on 80 per cent, and it was 57 per cent yes and 43 per cent no. I would have backed, as confidently as I could have, that my electorate was going to say no, because that's the circle of friends I associate with. So I was surprised when the result came back the way it did. It makes me question my judgement now: am I a good member or not? I misread it because the blokes in the pub told me what their position was, and it was similar to mine. My people at church told me what their position was, and it was similar to mine. The people in the party told me. But I got it wrong. It came back the other way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I drew counsel after speaking with my 10 executives. In my maiden speech, I made a commitment to the people of Wright, my electorate, that amongst other things I would be the voice of the silent majority, because so often, with the minority groups, the squeaky wheel gets the oil. I don't know if I said that wrong. I meant to say I would be the voice of the silent majority. The silent majority in this case have whispered in my ear. Some are passionate, and I tie it into the passion and commitment you have shown on your cause and your journey. For the benefit of <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, I refer to those in the gallery still. There will be some who have voted because they're just sick of hearing it and they want it dealt with; they just want the government to get on with business which has greater effect on their lives. I don't know what that percentage breakdown is. I don't know what the split is, but it doesn't matter; the number still stands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't have any emotional story. I have a cousin who is part of the gay community. I don't have those tear-jerking stories; I just don't. I have my faith and I have my party. In the next day or two, I'm going to need to come into this chamber and cast my vote. My party have unleashed me. They have allowed me to vote in line with the electorate's wishes, because how can one be the voice of the electorate if you turn a deaf ear to what they are saying? How can one lead? Even though it is against my principles, I will come into this chamber and I will support it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have the caveat that I will try to get the protections—through minor amendments, not the complex amendments we saw in the Senate—for those religious freedoms. I'm going to speak briefly to the protection of religious freedoms, because everyone runs off in this crazy domain. I want to find the happy fulcrum between religious freedom and freedom of speech. At the moment, if you say one thing, you're in breach of the antidiscrimination act, and the freedom of speech is still untested in that space. I want to find some place where we land that omits Australia from the Supreme Court decision or decisions which will be handed down on a virtually identical case in the US—we should have those findings in the next day or two—and from a virtually identical case in the UK. I want to spare the communities here in Australia from those cases by making sure that we just grind our teeth and get it right to avoid that hardship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the previous speaker's commentary on the hate that happens in certain areas, but in my area there was no hate speech. Country people are so respectful. They may not like you, but you'll always get a cup of tea and a scone. You'll always get a feed—absolutely. I acknowledge the electors of Wright, who have asked me to be their voice, to be their casting vote in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Others have acknowledged many in this place; before I wrap up, I'm going to acknowledge two people, because I think without them we wouldn't be having this debate. I acknowledge Tony Abbott, the former Prime Minister, who made a contribution to this debate by giving a commitment that he would ask the Australian public for their opinion, because without that opinion I would've walked into this chamber every day of the week and voted no, without question. It's only because I have this solid data in front of me that I have found a different position. I acknowledge Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who could've taken a juxtaposed position to what the former Prime Minister did, because not all of their political ideologies are aligned—and they're not in this space—but the vehicle for passage, shifting my mind through the support of evidence, has got me to the place where I am.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to the days ahead, and I ask Labor, through my good friend and colleague from the seat of Perth, not to dismiss the journey I have taken to get here, when I try to find reason in my heart to get an amendment to protect that other 43 per cent, who are scared and frightened of this. Help me take them on the journey. Don't say no to the amendments; have a good look at them first. I'll debate you on the floor in good conscience, my friend.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SWANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:42</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. Twenty-one-and-a-half years ago, a smiling young Meryl Partridge stood next to the love of her life, Nick Swanson, in the Kurri Kurri Baptist Church and exchanged vows that allowed them to become husband and wife. My dad bet me on that day, knowing that I have an inclination to run late, as my staff will attest, that if I turned up on time at the church, he would buy me a canteen of cutlery. I wanted that cutlery very badly, and I got to that church on time. Our minister was a very well-known politician in local circles. He doubled as the Liberal state member for Maitland, Milton Morris—also known as Mr Maitland—and a Baptist minister, but I had worked with him for a number of years before Nick and I were engaged. When we were engaged, Milton Morris said to me, 'Meryl, it'd be my honour to marry you.' It was a remarkable time in my life, where I had an elder statesman of the Liberal Party, and my personal mentor, marrying me to my husband, who came from a very different set of life circumstances to me. He was a country boy from a wheat, sheep and beef farm in central New South Wales, marrying a coalminer's daughter. His family were Catholic and mine were Protestant. We were poles apart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-GeneralInterjecting">An honourable member:</span>  A mixed marriage!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="264170" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms SWANSON:</span>
                    </a>  Yes. As my father, Ben, walked his youngest daughter down the aisle in our family church that had been beautifully decorated by my mum with flowers from our garden, it was one of those moments in my life where I thought, 'Wow, this is amazing, and I'm getting that cutlery, because I'm on time!' At the time of my father's passing last October, my parents had been married for an incredible 65 years. They'd been known to each other, courting, for five years before that, so that makes 70.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Marriage is a very special thing, as so many of us know, and it can bring very odd couples together at times, as I am here to attest today. As I've often said, I was a small, ground-dwelling bird, a Partridge, before I got married, and then I married a Swanson. I have become slightly more elongated, I hope, and more elegant, perhaps—but that's for others to judge, certainly not me! Marriage is that legal statement of love and joy and commitment that has not been available to everyone in Australia, until now. We are on the cusp of something special in this country—and it's not before time, but it is time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An interesting twist to my day and Nick's day was that one of my very best friends was also with us on that day. He had been my friend since year 7 in high school, when we met. He came from a different primary school to me. We met in English, probably in the first week or so of year 7. I knew he was different, but there was just something about him. He was just the most generous and fantastic person. When I rang him and said that I was getting engaged, he was so happy and delighted for me. I said, 'Will you be in the wedding?' and he said, 'Of course'. So he was one of Nick's groomsmen. I'm happy to say, if we can make a really fabulous decision in this place this week, he and his partner, almost 22 years after Nick and I were able to make our vows, will be able to make their vows. But it's not before time, and I have to say that these last few months have been an incredibly painful time for my high school friend and the love of his life. They've been together for almost as long as my husband and me. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So much pain and hurt has been relived in these last few months. I don't say that lightly and I'm not saying it to try to create a tear-jerking moment. I'm saying it out of truth and compassion and all of those things that come up for people who are different, when they have to face the obstacles of life and when they have to talk to their families about who they are and who they've known themselves to be since they were very young. My friend had that discussion with me often at school. He'd say to me, 'Meryl, if I could be different, I would be, but I'm gay.' I've lived with that and with that friendship since I was 13. It's taught me so much about acceptance. It's actually made me a better person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I want to apologise to the people of Australia who are in loving, wonderful relationships and have been through a torrid time these last few months. For many of you, the pain of other judgements in past years have been brought back to you. I'm sorry for that, but I stand here today saying that I am proud that the electorate of Paterson voted yes and I am proud that, even if it hadn't, I would have voted yes because, when I stood to become a member of parliament, through my life experience, I always said that I believed that treating people equally was the most important thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the passage of marriage equality legislation through the Senate last week marked a historic day for Australia, and now it's up to us here in this House to take that final step. As many of my colleagues have said, taking such a significant step towards equality makes Australia a better place for everyone. The day on which Australia achieves marriage equality has been a long time coming. It's not here yet, but we are close. All that is needed is for this House to pass this marriage equality bill. I firmly believe that parliament is at its best when we work together for a common cause, and, just as we saw in the Senate last week, MPs from all sides of this House can work together to get this done. The bill that was passed in the Senate and comes to us was negotiated across party lines and belief lines. It reflects an appropriate balance, the right balance, between ensuring marriage equality for all Australians and protecting religious freedoms for all Australians. This law does matter to Australians. This law gives rights to Australians, but, more importantly, this law expresses the values of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was incredibly proud of my electorate of Paterson when the results of the marriage equality plebiscite, or the survey, were declared. While the national 'yes' vote came in at 61.6 per cent, in the electorate of Paterson, my electorate, the 'yes' vote, was a resounding 65.5 per cent. Thank you, Paterson. That means that 60,915 people in the electorate of Paterson voted that the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry. Nearly two out of every three voters said yes. The communities that make up the electorate of Paterson proved themselves to be communities that respect and value equality. For that, I'm immensely pleased and proud.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, just as a percentage of people nationwide voted no, so did a percentage of people in the Paterson electorate. For various reasons those people chose not to extend marriage equality to all, and I respect that view. Some have criticised my support for marriage equality and some have questioned whether I truly represent them if I vote yes in this bill. To them I have to say today that I acknowledge the concerns that you have and I do not dismiss them. But I also say to you that more than 7.8 million Australians, 61.6 per cent of voters, voted yes for marriage equality. The overwhelmingly positive vote in every state and territory, and in my electorate of Paterson, cannot be avoided or ignored. The will of the people is clear and the parliament must work to ensure that their will becomes law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have made it clear from the outset of the debate on this issue that, like my Labor colleagues, I respect freedom of religion. I have also made it clear that I will support measures that are necessary to protect freedom of religion. I am satisfied that the protections for religious freedom in this bill are suitable and adequate. Those protections are based on the unanimous recommendations of the Senate committee, a multiparty Senate committee that examined the same-sex marriage bill. In preparing the report, the committee consulted extensively with the community and, with its cross-party members, it then worked very hard to reach the consensus position. Their position is shared by the vast majority of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do respect that there are a range of views about the question of marriage equality and that there are a range of views on how religious freedoms should be protected, but I am confident that this bill goes far enough. It protects freedom of religion while allowing marriage equality. I support the provisions in the bill that preserve religious freedom in respect of the performance of the marriage ceremony and the provision of goods and services that are reasonably incidental to the marriage ceremony. But I do not and will never support measures that would effectively roll back hard-fought-for antidiscrimination laws. Like this bill, those antidiscrimination laws are far too important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to conclude by saying that we have shown the Australian people that respect for marriage equality is equally an important foundation of our diverse and harmonious society. One doesn't rule the other out, and those who would try to persuade us otherwise are simply pushing a barrow or fuelling political mischief. The legalisation of same-sex marriage in Australia does not warrant a repeal of any antidiscrimination laws. In fact, the sentiment—the value—contained in this legislation, that of equality for all, demands quite the opposite. It demands protection of antidiscrimination laws. This bill strikes a sensible and acceptable compromise between achieving marriage equality and protecting religious freedom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many in this House, I have been contacted by many constituents since the 'yes' vote was declared and even more so since our colleagues in the Senate voted for marriage equality. Some have sent form letters, and we have seen several organised lobbies and campaigns. Others have sent individual responses, most expressing their personal heartfelt joy at the direction we are taking, but in some cases their personal and heartfelt concern, and in other cases, fear. This vote, this bill, has never been about political correctness or removing the rights of parents to control what their children learn at school. This bill has been about marriage equality. The people have spoken: love has won. Let's get this done. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:54</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to place on the public record my position and my views in relation to the issue of same-sex marriage. The coalition government made a commitment to the people of Australia to let them have their say on this important issue. I must say that at the time there was very significant debate about the merits of running a postal survey to ascertain the views of the Australian people, but the response to that survey was absolutely overwhelming, with some 79.5 per cent of people deciding to participate in that survey. This is an outstanding result by international standards when you compare it with, for example, the EU Brexit referendum, which came in at around 72.7 per cent. In the 2016 US presidential election, the participation rate was in the order of 60 per cent. In the British election the following year, it was around 70 per cent. So there was a huge amount of interest in this issue from Australians from all walks of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say that the debate that has ensued to this point in this House on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 has been respectful and heartfelt. I wish to record my position. Just as the participation in the survey was so overwhelming, so was the result, with some 61.6 per cent of Australians answering yes and 38.4 per cent answering no. That was broadly the response that was achieved in my electorate, with some 60 per cent answering yes and 40 per cent answering no. In the electorate of Cowper, which I'm privileged to represent, some 95,800 voters completed the survey. I have always been clear on my stance with regard to same-sex marriage that I personally don't support that, and in fact I recorded a no vote in that survey. But I certainly respect the decision of the Australian people, and I've always said that I will respect the decision made by the majority of the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this process, I've been communicating regularly with my constituents on this matter and I have received numerous representations on both sides of the argument. There have been a range of concerns raised about the issue of religious freedom, which has come up very regularly in this debate. There have been concerns in relation to the issue that the bill as currently drafted affords no protections to Christians who, for matters of conscience, would consider the provision of services to a same-sex marriage as making them complicit in an activity which contravenes their faith. That is their view. I certainly respect that view, and I'm certainly of the view that all Australians would respect those Christians who feel that way. I certainly welcome the announcement of the review of the expert panel into legal protections for religious freedom. The review is led by a very notable former member of this House, Philip Ruddock, with an expert panel consisting of the recently appointed President of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Emeritus Professor Rosalind Croucher AM; the Hon. Dr Annabelle Bennett AO, SC; and Father Frank Brennan. They are great Australians who will look into that very important issue of religious freedom. During the course of the proceedings in this House, I will be supporting a number of amendments which I believe will improve this bill. However, should the amendments fail, I will be voting yes in accordance with the commitments that I have made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to conclude with a reflection on the debate that has occurred in my electorate. I must say that there have been issues raised by members in their contributions to this House about the treatment of some on either side of the debate. I must say that, within the electorate of Cowper, the debate has been conducted in a very fair, reasonable and respectful way, with people with very strongly held views on both sides of this question treating each other appropriately. I think that's part of coming from the country. The member for Wright indicated that you can disagree but then sit down and have a cup of tea afterwards. I think a very similar sentiment existed in the electorate of Cowper. To conclude, I welcome the opportunity to place my position on the public record, and I certainly look forward to a very successful conclusion to this issue after the debate within this House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AMR" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:59</span>):  I rise to support the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 and, in so doing in this place, join the millions of Australians who voted for marriage equality. The bill that is before us does two things: it ensures that marriage from now on is 'the union of two people to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life'; and it expands religious freedoms. It has been a very long time coming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Debate about marriage equality was part of the political discourse well before I came into this place in 2001. Initially, I was not a public supporter of marriage equality. Newly elected to a very marginal seat that had a long history of connection with and influence by the Catholic Church, I was, to my shame, nervous about being so. But it was the courage of LGBTIQ Australians—in particular, two lovely men who came to see me with their newly born daughter and shared with me their story and their love—that helped me to find my courage. At the end of the day, that is what carried this debate: the courage of people who have shared their personal stories, who have campaigned, who have quietly persuaded and who ultimately, when this vote is done, have prevailed—not just for them but for the nation, making us a better, stronger and more inclusive place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has not been without its toll. The postal survey has been a gruelling and emotional process, one that has done damage and has placed same-sex couples and their families in the invidious position of having their relationship subject to the scrutiny of an entire population. Mental health organisations across the country have been very clear: they have experienced a substantial rise in the number of people experiencing distress and needing their care. That was the process that the Prime Minister gave to the LGBTIQ community, and, frankly, they will never forgive him for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the day that the survey results were announced, amongst all of the jubilation there was also an overwhelming sense of relief—of a burden being lifted. I don't think many realised how tightly held together people were. But you only had to see the image of my friend and colleague Penny, one of the toughest people I know, to see how hard it has been. I am sorry that you and your families have been put through that. So I say to all of the LGBTIQ members of our community: please be assured that this parliament will get this done. Now is the time for all of you to spend time with your families, caring for and nurturing each other and, in some cases, allowing hurts to heal. It is our job now to put this right. In the course of today and tomorrow, the burden of the argument rests with us in this place to resolve, and resolve it we will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had numerous conversations with LGBTIQ couples in Ballarat over the past few weeks. I felt proud to stand alongside them and, hopefully, by using my voice to its fullest extent, provide a contrast to some of the hurt they have felt. I have been privileged to be asked to my first wedding; sent my first 'congratulations on your engagement' card to my friend Ben's mum, Fiona, and her partner, Ann; and, at the Clunes show recently, listened with joy to the wedding plans of two lovely community members whom I have known for years. I joined Anne and Eddie, who have been extraordinary national champions for marriage equality at the same time as campaigning ferociously for quality of life for people with dementia, as they celebrated their commitment ceremony while Eddie could still fully participate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In every conversation, there has been a great sense of joy but also something else that I admit I wasn't expecting. I find it a little hard to explain, but the best I can come up with is a sense of rightness and of peace. I spoke with two women I have known for over 16 years, Helen and Sandy, at an event we were all at on Sunday. In the middle of telling me of their plans to marry in March next year in their beautiful garden, one thing Helen said to me struck me strongly. She said, 'I feel safer.' I don't think until that moment I had realised just how much this vote meant. The fact that same-sex couples have felt unsafe and, to some extent, have led hidden lives only truly known to those closest to them is deeply appalling to me. The fact that I had intellectually known that this was the case but had not fully understood the deep and abiding impact and hurt of this injustice humbled me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak very briefly in this debate about the protection of religious freedoms that is contained in this bill. In addition to extending equality of marriage, this bill also broadens the protection of religious freedoms. It does so by protecting ministers of religion who refuse to solemnise marriage in conformity with their religious beliefs; creating a new category of religious celebrants who may also refuse; and protecting bodies created for religious purposes who refuse goods and services. They are appropriate and sufficient measures for religious freedoms within this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is now a view, largely driven by proponents of the 'no' vote, that there needs to be wider protection for religious freedoms. I acknowledge that the government has taken the decision to ask a former member of this place, Philip Ruddock, to lead a process for that discussion, but I want to make it very clear that I am a supporter of an expansion of rights and that those rights should be reflected more formally either by way of the Constitution or by way of a bill of rights. But we already have within the Constitution, in section 116, a freedom of religion, and the High Court has clearly determined the limits and balance of that freedom. The claims that religious freedoms should be extended to people being able to say and do things that amount to discrimination against LGBTIQ Australians is simply unacceptable to me, and I will not support such a move or such amendments here in this bill or in any other subsequent debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill sees the end of institutionalised discrimination against LGBTIQ Australians when it comes to marriage. I hope the courage of so many Australians in this campaign provides a strong message to young LGBTIQ Australians that you are loved, you are included and you belong, whoever you choose to love. I could not be prouder of my own community for the message of inclusion that it has sent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own community, in my office and within the labour movement more broadly, we decided to campaign. We joined the Pride Hub—Kirsten, Cameron and others; Brett Edgington and his team from Ballarat Trades and Labour Council; state members of parliament; and local councillors. We ran an enrolment drive. We doorknocked. We phone banked. We rallied. We wrote to 10,000 young people explaining why we were voting yes. Most of all, we hoped. We saw 100 young people from the Ballarat Arts Academy at Federation Uni sing for marriage equality, and their video was shared thousands of times across the country. The result in my home town was 82 per cent participation, higher than the national average, with over 70 per cent saying yes to marriage equality, again higher than the national average.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when finally this debate is concluded and we cast our vote, I will do so for Helen and Sandy; for Anne and Edie; for Ben, Fiona and Anne; for Mark and his partner; and for my neighbour who lost her partner a few years ago. I'll cast my vote for all of those LGBTIQ Australians who have been so courageous throughout this debate and for the young people who have simply asked us to vote for love, to vote yes for marriage equality.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:08</span>):  This is a historic moment in our nation's history, whatever your views have been or continue to be in relation to the definition of marriage. It's a historic moment that has arisen from the voice of the Australian people, not simply the voices of parliamentarians debating legislation in this place. Thanks to the postal survey, every Australian has had the opportunity to participate in the conversation, to have their say and to cast their vote on whether the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry. As such, there is an enormous sense of legitimacy around the legislation that we are debating tonight, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, and I also believe there is an overwhelming respect for what is one of the most significant social reforms in our nation's history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to everyone in the coalition party room—including the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, and the Prime Minister, the member for Wentworth—for holding firm to our commitment to allow all Australians to have their say on whether the law should be changed. This was despite all the public opposition, the dire predictions, the threats, the offensive comments and the claims that the Australian people could not be trusted to hold a respectful conversation about such an important social change. Despite all of that, we stayed true to our commitment to allow all Australians to have their say, and they have spoken. Despite my own beliefs, I accept the result and I commit to respecting and reflecting on the floor of parliament the outcome as I consistently pledged to do. Just like millions of other Australians, people on the Central Coast overwhelmingly had their say. Eight out of 10 people who were enrolled to vote took part in the postal survey, with 65.7 per cent of eligible voters voting yes and 34.3 per cent voting no.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Holding a plebiscite in the form of a postal survey meant that we were able to hear directly from everyone, from a family of six in Kariong to a grandmother in Terrigal to a shopkeeper in Kincumber and to a university student at Umina Beach. In fact, many of these locals have written to me, people like Amber at Daleys Point, who said, 'I would like to thank you for committing to support the outcome of the marriage equality survey. I would like to say that I appreciate the effort your team put in to having your opinion voiced in such a tumultuous period.' Even those who doubted the postal survey were respectful to those who were willing to listen to the outcome. Melanie from Woy Woy wrote a beautiful email to me. She said of the process, 'It gives me faith in our political system that you can put aside any personal prejudice on this issue in order to stand with the majority of your constituents.' Melanie also said, 'If I ever find the right girl to settle down with, you will be invited to my wedding.' To Melanie, I would be glad to receive your invitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Receiving notes like this reinforces, beyond just my own personal principles and the desire to fulfil a promise that I made to my community, the need to respect and reflect the outcome of the postal survey. I intend to vote yes in this place to enact a law to allow same-sex couples to marry, not, I should clarify, because I voted yes myself in the postal survey. I have been very open and honest in declaring that I did, in fact, vote no, and I have been very vocal in explaining my reasons why.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I will support this legislation in whatever form it is decided upon by the parliament following our debate on amendments because the process enabled and supported by this government to hold a plebiscite has ensured that we have had the national debate we needed. This was a debate that we needed to fully explore the impact, the meaning and the potential consequences of redefining marriage in Australian law. We've helped those who stand by the view that marriage is between a man and a woman to have a legitimate vehicle for debate. Just as importantly, we provided the same platform to those who advocated for the change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the necessary respect for this process was not always embraced. Unfortunately, Labor and Labor's advocates on the Central Coast refused to accept a need for a plebiscite at all and continued to push a political agenda that had less to do with advocating a philosophical belief and more to do with attempting to delegitimise any process proposed by the coalition government to resolve the question of same-sex marriage. Unfortunately, in the course of the campaign, from advocates over the past few years, slogans like 'marriage equality' and 'love is love' became such powerful phrases that they were unfortunately sometimes used as emotional weapons against those who did not support changing the definition of marriage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who dared to ask a question about whether there may be any unintended ramifications to same-sex marriage legislation ran the risk of being potentially branded a bigot or a homophobe. Even Labor senator Deborah O'Neill, herself once an outspoken advocate for traditional marriage, retreated to calling the plebiscite an unnecessary conversation and a glorified opinion poll and did not vote on this bill either way in the Senate. Labor's candidate for Robertson, Anne Charlton, the state member for Gosford in the New South Wales parliament, Liesl Tesch, and Labor aligned advocates used every opportunity they could to portray a sense that the only way to believe in equality was to change the way that our society had thought about families for centuries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My response was that just as it was okay for them to say yes and it was also okay for me and millions of others to say no during the postal survey, during the debate that occurred over the last few months, I also said that it was okay to say no and at the same time to be able to believe in love, to believe in equality and to believe in commitment in relationships. With respect to the outcome that has led me to speak on this debate in the chamber tonight, if it was okay to say yes and okay to say no, it is also okay to respect the voice of millions of Australians who also expressed their deeply held beliefs in the importance of religion, freedom of speech and parental choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill is what the title says: a bill about the definition of marriage and how that may impact on freedoms. So this means that it is right to explore what we want marriage to be, including the fact that under this legislation marriage is defined as a union of two people to the exclusion of all others. But it is also right to explore why it's equally important that our freedoms are protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My primary concern that I expressed during the plebiscite debate, both as an MP and as a mother, is one that has been raised with me by thousands of other people around the country. It's based around the notion that marriage is about more than love and equality. It's also a commitment that two parents will work together to the best of their ability to raise their children. That's not a view that I express lightly or without listening to the heartbeat of my community. Neville and Dawn in Ettalong Beach were among the hundreds who have contacted me. Neville and Dawn have a view that many share. They said that they believe in all people being respected, regarded and accepted equally, regardless of colour, race, religion, social beliefs or gender difference. But they said that to change the Marriage Act may have some ramifications. Fay and Michael from Erina raised concerns that these consequences would impact on the way that children saw their identity, while Alan from Narara was concerned about freedom of speech and religion being restricted. David from Koolewong believed that many are unaware of other possible unintended outcomes, like restrictions on choices, limits to actions and curbs on free speech. David said that the same fairness they thought they were sharing, they were giving away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are valid and real concerns in our community, so, regardless of my support for this legislation that is before the House, I still believe that it is important to ensure that we are not eroding freedoms that we now take for granted. This is especially true for our children and future generations, so that they are not subject, for instance, to the new ideology of gender neutrality which we are already seeing in programs like Safe Schools—at least not without first seeking parental consent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The same-sex marriage debate was defined long before the postal survey as being about equality and love, but as a nation we have not yet settled the question of whether gender remains relevant for young Australians and for future generations of young Australians. So we should definitely be prepared to continue engaging in that conversation and to ask, respectfully, whether gender matters, and what the consequences of gender-neutral theory for young people may mean. After all, we have never had a generation of children that have grown up without gender as a reference point in their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also seeking assurance, having looked closely at this bill and the suggested amendments, that changes being made to our marriage laws will not undermine the stability and freedom of faith and religious expression or impact detrimentally on important principles of freedom of speech. As such, I foreshadow my intention to vote in support of any sensible amendments that are proposed in this House that appropriately and properly deliver necessary safeguards to protect these important freedoms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure that legislation designed to provide equal rights for two persons to marry regardless of their gender does not inadvertently entrench a new inequality against those whose religious or conscientious beliefs align with a centuries-old framework of marriage. So while I will vote yes to the final bill, regardless of which amendments are adopted by this House, as the Treasurer and member for Cook said in this place, it is now time to pass a truly inclusive bill, one that recognises the views of 100 per cent of Australians and not just 61 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, may I reflect on my first speech to this chamber. I said that I have a strong belief that the family is the bedrock of Australian society and that we need to do everything we can to strengthen those families. I still believe this holds true and that by supporting our families, in whatever form they may take, as the most fundamental institution for the development of the individual, we are taking care of our nation's future. It is my sincere hope that, with this legislation to allow same-sex couples to marry enacted in the Australian parliament, the focus for the Australian parliament and, indeed, for our nation becomes how we can continue to work on supporting and strengthening Australian families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the future, when each one of us has long since left this place, my hope is that the mark of our maturity as a nation will be our emphasis on honouring and strengthening our families and defending the freedoms which are so deeply ingrained in our national identity. It is a hope I believe we can build on firm foundations, and a hope in which I am personally convicted through my lifelong belief and faith in my God. To those for whom the postal survey was not the outcome they voted for, rest assured I will continue to fight to ensure that your freedoms are protected, and our families are strengthened to benefit our Australian society and our future. This is, indeed, an historic moment wherever you sit on the spectrum of views on same-sex marriage, and I thank the House for the opportunity to take part in the debate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="248181" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:20</span>):  At the outset, I want to acknowledge two very dear friends of mine who are in the gallery this evening, Tom and James, because their experience very much informs where I come from in this debate. I remember being in Dubbo, some time ago now, walking the dogs with Tom when he told me he was going to get married. Of course, I was overwhelmed by joy that my friends were embarking on such a joyous occasion, but the reality very quickly set in for me: clearly that wedding wasn't going to take place in Australia. Fortunately, they found themselves some fabulous conservative member of parliament from Copenhagen who was able to marry them, and we got to celebrate here in Canberra many months later with all of their family and friends. But this bill that is before us tonight, this bill that was passed by the Senate last week, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, is going to ensure that every other LGBTI person in Australia doesn't have to go overseas, doesn't have to run from their communities, from their families, from their extended families and loved ones to take part in that moment that should be shared with everyone you love in your life at that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel the sense of history very much tonight in this House. The people of Australia have voted yes; they have made their intention very clear. The Senate, likewise, voted yes last week for marriage equality. Now it's really time for this House to do our job—a job that I think we should have done a long time ago, I might add—and make marriage equality law in Australia. By the end of this week we should be free of the last remaining piece of discriminatory law for LGBTIQ Australians. Finally, federal law will, in fact, reflect the basic truth that same-sex couples' love is just as real and that their relationships are just as valid as any other. Finally, people in same-sex relationships will be able to join in marriage, something that heterosexual couples have taken for granted for way too long. And finally, federal law will align with the values of the majority of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could not be more proud to be the representative for the people of Newcastle in this chamber tonight because Newcastle was a city that returned an overwhelming 'yes' vote when the question was put. In fact, 74.8 per cent of my community in Newcastle voted yes. It was the highest-voting electorate in New South Wales outside of Sydney, and it was, indeed, the highest regional 'yes' vote in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't say that I was utterly surprised in the sense that it had long been the message I had gained from my community over many, many years debating this issue. I also know that Novocastrians have a deeply embedded sense of fairness. Even though a lot of people have approached the question of marriage equality from a lot of different angles, in Newcastle that sense of fairness and what is right was so palpable that when given the opportunity to say, 'Do you think people of same sex should have the right to marry like every other Australian?' almost without hesitation, I would say, people were voting yes. I knew that because, when I first stood as a candidate for parliament back in 2012, I attended many of the forums and community debates like we all do when we're running for election. I can recall being asked time and again where I stood on the question of marriage equality, because in those days it wasn't party policy. It was a conscience vote for the Labor Party when I was first standing. I decided there and then that I would have to be straight up with the electors of Newcastle that I couldn't compromise on a really fundamental principle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having spent my entire life fighting discrimination of one kind or another or being an advocate in that field, I could not for one moment contemplate not completing the job of this parliament. I acknowledge here the great work of the former Labor government in removing discrimination from some 85 separate pieces of legislation, but this marriage law was the one hurdle we hadn't got to. So it is absolutely time for this parliament to address this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was asked where I stood and what my position was, I was very happy to look my electorate in the eyes at every rally and forum and say that, if ever I got the opportunity in the Australian parliament to cast a vote on this issue, I would vote a resounding yes. I have got to say that, even for that 25 per cent of Novocastrians who haven't cast a 'yes' vote, they nonetheless have respect for my position, for the majority position of the electorate and, indeed, for the fact that I have been truthful and up-front about my position from day one. Novocastrians, like many people in Australia, I am sure, want to know you're going to be straight with them on any given issue. You can hold a different opinion, but you just need to be able to explain your position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only thing I regret is having just missed out on making it into the top 10 count in the overall results for Australia, although I do acknowledge that I was pipped at the post by the member for Warringah's electorate, which came in at 10th position. That news was greeted with a peculiar kind of satisfaction for me. But I was nonetheless so extremely proud of the people of Newcastle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I have remaining tonight I wanted to acknowledge some of the longstanding and fearless advocates who have been important people in my life, who have been champions in my community and who really laid the foundations for the legislation that comes before us tonight. I want to first acknowledge my deep, and now late, friend Paul O'Grady, who was the first openly gay man to be elected in any Australian parliament. Sadly, I lost Paul a few years ago, but he actually wasn't that fussed about marriage in itself. The love of his life, Murray, had died in 1994. Paul was nonetheless a fierce advocate of social justice, fairness, decency and democracy and stood up every time to be counted against discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't imagine what it would have been like being a young man in 1988 being elected into the New South Wales upper house on a platform of being openly gay. He told me stories that were just horrifying about those times, but he never, ever retreated from being that fearless advocate who looked discrimination straight in the eye and took it on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to make a special acknowledgement of my predecessor, the former member for Newcastle, Sharon Grierson, who was so rock-solid in her support for marriage equality. I don't know if she is listening in tonight, but I got to see her on the night of the results of the survey, and the smile on her face really said it all. On this issue she was well and truly ahead of her time, being the first parliamentarian to ever sign the Australian Marriage Equality's charter of equality. At the time, I remember, I was a slightly younger member on her staff, and we were all like: 'Oh, my God! This is not ALP policy. You've just signed this pledge.' And she looked at me and said: 'Sharon, this is an issue I care deeply about. I am a member of the ALP. I'm a fierce and passionate Novocastrian, but I'm a human first, and this is a human rights issue.' She had the courage to sign that charter at a time when very few did, I've got to say. Thankfully, that has changed now. She signed that charter in 2006, and she had to wait another six years to be able to cast a yes vote in this chamber. Regretfully, the time was not ripe, and that yes vote did not carry at that time. She's waited another five years for that yes to become a reality. I hope that we in the chamber tonight, or very soon, will give her great heart and encouragement that those initial steps she took really did help pave the way for those of us that came after.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to give a shout out to a very dear friend, Michelle Lancey. I don't know if she is listening tonight, but I expect she will be. Michelle is a very strong Christian woman I've known for a very long time. Michelle has three kids, one of whom is gay. She has never for a moment doubted that every single one of her kids deserves the same rights as the others. She has been a fearless advocate in my community. She heads up PFLAG, Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. Along with her national spokesperson, Shelley Argent, she has led a formidable campaign for decades around this issue. So I want to pay a tribute to Michelle Lancey tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also acknowledge the people of ACON Hunter and all of the advocates and warriors who have spent decades of their lives championing this cause. I think it is fit that we acknowledge those who come before us, which is why I've attempted to put on record some of that tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course—in this chamber and in the house opposite—when I think about the journey that my friend and colleague Senator Penny Wong has been on, both within the Labor Party and in the Australian parliament, over such a long period of time, it is utterly unimaginable to have walked in her shoes through some pretty horrific times over the last decade or so in this parliament around this issue. But she never gave up. She never gave up. So, despite however tough it has seemed from time to time, I have never allowed myself the luxury of saying, 'This is too hard,' or ever thinking it wasn't worth pursuing, because the LGBTI community in Australia are relying on us to stand up here in this parliament and do the right thing now. They've waited a very, very long time, and the time really has come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I asked Tom earlier tonight, before they left Nyngan to join us in this debate, what message he might want to portray in this debate tonight, he said to me, 'Who would have known that a chance meeting 15 years ago in the Nyngan RSL would lead to me and James settling in that small country town?' He told me just how thankful they are that their friends and community have been so incredibly supportive and accepting of their relationship. But they made the point that I want to end on this evening: they were surprised themselves by the impact that this national postal survey had on them. Their retreat from social media for several weeks or months really matches the experiences of so many LGBTI men and women in my community. When the 'yes' vote came in, there was an utter sense of relief more than anything, and hope that this perpetual judgement on their relationships would finally come to an end. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Revenue and Financial Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:35</span>):  Eight years ago, on this very day, I was elected by the people of Higgins to serve them in this place, to represent their interests both big and small. It is a tremendous privilege. When I gave my first speech some months later, I spoke about how families are the bedrock of our society, that they come in all shapes and sizes, and anything we can do to strengthen families will strengthen our society. After all, families support each other emotionally, physically and financially, in good times and bad. I strongly believe that a change to the Marriage Act to give same-sex couples equality before the law will only strengthen families. The institution of marriage provides for a public declaration of love and commitment where promises are made and sanctioned by the state. This, and society's longstanding appreciation of it and its solemnness, gives marriage its special place and power in our society. This bill, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill, will strengthen families by building stronger bonds of commitment between two people regardless of their gender and sexual orientation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The great Sir Robert Menzies said in his 'Forgotten people' speech in 1942:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I do not believe that the real life of this nation is to be found either in great luxury hotels and the petty gossip of so-called fashionable suburbs, or in the officialdom of the organised masses. It is to be found in the homes of people who are nameless and unadvertised, and who, whatever their individual religious conviction or dogma, see in their children their greatest contribution to the immortality of their race. The home is the foundation of sanity and sobriety; it is the indispensable condition of continuity; its health determines the health of society as a whole.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a Liberal, I believe strongly in respecting our individual freedoms and treating everyone equally before the law. As Liberals, we have a proud history in ending all sorts of discrimination. In fact, one of my predecessors in the seat of Higgins, former Prime Minister John Gorton, played a pivotal role in the decriminalisation of homosexuality through his 1973 motion before this parliament. This change we are debating to the Marriage Act has been a long time coming, for many of us on both sides of this chamber. I know that there are many opposite who have been frustrated with how the Labor Party dealt with this issue during their time in government and since—just as I and others in my party also had frustrations with how the matter has progressed on our side of the chamber. Indeed, it is well known that, in the 2015 coalition party room meeting debate on same-sex marriage, I argued strongly both in favour of same-sex marriage and for a free vote for members of parliament in accordance with Liberal precedent under the Menzies, Gorton, McMahon, Fraser and Howard governments. Whilst the decision of the party room to conduct a plebiscite was not the one I had argued for, in the end I think that conducting a national plebiscite has allowed us to move forward with this important social change with greater unity and purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost 80 per cent of all eligible Australians participated, with an overwhelming majority of Australians supporting a change to the Marriage Act. In my own electorate, we saw an exceptionally strong result of 78.3 per cent of residents supporting a change to the Marriage Act, the sixth highest electorate result in the country and the highest result for a Liberal held seat in Victoria. To have such an emphatic response in my community and more broadly across Victoria and across Australia is an affirmation of love, equality under the law, fairness and family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the years, I have sat down with, spoken with and heard from so many of my constituents, who told me why they wanted a change to the Marriage Act and how the exclusion of same-sex couples from this important institution has impacted them and their partners, friends, children, parents and grandparents. Sue wrote to me, telling me how, in 2016, she attended her son's marriage to his husband in New York, where they could have such a ceremony. She wrote about how it was the happiest, most loving wedding she had ever been to, but told me about how every time she showed her mother—her son's grandmother—pictures and videos from the wedding, her mother teared up because she was not physically able to travel to New York to attend.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard from Richard and his partner, who are renovating their home in preparation of welcoming their baby next year. They don't just want to have a commitment ceremony; they want to be married. They understand and want to join in the solemn institution of marriage. Richard wrote: 'When we signed the contracts to buy our home together, that house contract surprised me by how much I was struck with the symbolism of a commitment to each other—a joint venture. Marriage is legal and legal matters.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also heard from another local, Robyn Whitaker, an ordained minister of the Uniting Church. Robyn wrote about her journey in relation to same-sex marriage. On reconciling her view with her religion, Robyn wrote: 'I am now a supporter of marriage equality, not despite my faith but precisely because my Christian faith demands that I treat others with compassion, justice and love. I believe that love and marriage are God's gift to us. Why would we not want those gifts to be available to every consenting adult?' These are just some of the many examples of the discussions, letters, emails and conversations that I have had.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that there are also a significant number of Australians who hold very sincere and genuine concerns about a change to the Marriage Act and its potential impact on religious freedoms. As a Liberal, I believe that it is important to preserve people's freedoms. Importantly, this bill will not prevent people from worshipping as they choose, nor will it prevent them from holding their beliefs or undertaking their religious practice. Churches, synagogues and mosques and their clergy, rabbis and imams will continue to be free to practise their faith in accordance with their doctrine and beliefs, just as they do today. The bill before us takes away none of these rights, nor should it. Just as the current framework of religious freedoms allows a minister of religion to refuse to solemnise a marriage, this bill will allow ministers of religion to refuse to solemnise a same-sex marriage if that refusal conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of the minister's religion—for example, where the minister's religion only allows heterosexual couples to marry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, however, will create a new category of religious marriage celebrants. This new category will include existing civil marriage celebrants wanting to perform marriages consistent with their religious beliefs. It will also allow bodies established for religious purpose to be able to refuse to make a facility available or provide goods and services for the purpose of or reasonably incidental to the solemnisation of a marriage. Nothing in this bill takes away a right that presently exists, nor does it diminish existing freedoms. Having said this, I will, of course, do my colleagues the courtesy of carefully looking at any potential amendments to this bill and consider them on their merits. I will not, however, support new forms of discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's important to acknowledge my friends and colleagues who have played such a pivotal role in agitating for change to our party's policy on this issue. In particular, I'd like to acknowledge the leadership of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, the first Australian Prime Minister to have advocated for and prosecuted this cause. I believe it will stand as one of the significant achievements of the Turnbull government. I would also like to acknowledge Senator Dean Smith for his relentless strength and leadership in seeing this bill brought before the parliament, along with others in this place like Trent Zimmerman, who is in the chamber now, who has worked so hard. I would also like to acknowledge the member for Leichhardt, Warren Entsch, who has probably done more than anyone in this place to advocate for change. His unwavering sense of decency in pursuit of a fair go for all Australians, no matter their gender and no matter who they love, is in stark contrast to his sometimes gruff exterior. I'd like to acknowledge the hard work and quiet determination of Senator Simon Birmingham, who marched alongside me into the offices of different prime ministers and senior ministers over a long period of time to make the case for change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it has not just been Liberals who have argued for this change. We have had colleagues in our Nationals party room who have done the same. I'd like to acknowledge Senator Scullion and the member for Gippsland, Darren Chester, who joined with Senator Birmingham and me as the parliamentary patrons for the Liberals and Nationals for Yes campaign. I commend all of those colleagues, staff, party members and volunteers who have worked so hard in pursuit of what I truly believe to be both a liberal and a conservative cause. There have been so many more—too many to list in one speech—but I thank them all, just as I thank the millions of Australians who have made their views known and have participated in this important survey and debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am delighted to support the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. It is a bill that will see individuals choose to marry the individual they wish to marry. This bill reflects the will of the Australian people to amend the Marriage Act. It seeks to remove existing discrimination from the Marriage Act and to protect religious institutions and freedoms. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:47</span>):  I have to say, I am absolutely thrilled to rise to support the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 today, as I have supported marriage equality previously in this place. This bill is well considered, it's well balanced and it's well overdue. Today I have the greatest privilege to stand in this place to speak on behalf of my electorate, 65.7 per cent of whom voted yes. I want to use my time to give voice to the words of some of the amazing people who campaigned for love, kindness and fairness in my local area.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This campaign was actively supported by me and my federal colleague the member for Whitlam, and by our state colleagues. Especially I want to note Paul Scully, the member for Wollongong, who opened his home to host phone-calling nights. Our Labor councillors also worked hard. Thanks to Tania Brown, Jenelle Rimmer, David Brown, Janice Kershaw and Vicky King. Thank you also to Young Labor. I want to acknowledge members of the Liberal Party and the Greens in my local area who also supported a 'yes' vote. A big thanks for a campaign video from former Illawarra Steelers captain, John Cross. I want to say thank you to my dedicated office team—Nathan, Alison, Idalina, Dionne and Donna—who did have some tough days on the phones in the office.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the survey is a waste of $100 million and it has hurt many people, finally 61% of Australians has said to me "I am now equal". After 58yrs of my life being like a second class citizen once the bill is passed I will be like ALL Australians. I never thought that day would come after all those years of fighting. Finally I am equal.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Being asked to be part of this campaign has been a crazy and fun journey. Originally I jumped on board for a night of fun and to put a few smiles on people's faces. But by doing this the whole yes campaign became such a close little project to my heart and when the overall vote came back as "YES" it just made everything so worth it! All the hard work that was put in has paid off.</span>

Seeing the work that everyone put in, donating things like time, food, and venues - all so willing to help each other out was so beautiful to see. The acceptance within the Illawarra, especially within the last few months, has been overwhelming to say the least. Not only on a level of community, but for myself, a personal level as well, Illawarra have embraced Roxee Horror and it's so surreal and humbling.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I was 11 when the Marriage Act was changed. I was 13 when I had my first crush on a girl. I didn't know what those feelings were, or why I was having them, or what I was meant to do.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I'm ecstatic that this legislation means I won't again in my adult life, feel ashamed of who I am.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We've been together for over five years now, and lived in Wollongong our entire lives. The postal survey made us experience feelings of insecurity, and a lack of self-worth. We wanted to make the LGBTIQ people of Albion Park feel welcomed and well represented, so we campaigned hard, letterbox dropped, door knocked, and put posters up around town. Every Thursday night we made phone calls with other equality campaigners to people all over Australia. We have to say a lot of the feedback was positive, however the low self worth and insecurity continued to stay, with people pulling down posters, and people screaming obscenities at us, before slamming the door shut.</span>

We did that, we organised, we marched, we sought to bring others with us. The vote for marriage equality was a vote for fairness, commitment, and love.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Not since the AIDS tragedy have I ever known my community under so much distress and attack. I have friends who live in the city and the country and all of them expressed deep disappointment that the Parliament put the vote out to the people. I have heard stories of family breakdowns where young GLBTIQ people have had falling outs with Grand Parents, Fathers fallen out with sons and young people in our community attempting suicide because they have had their identity crushed. Like any culture, the GLBTIQ community are proud of our heritage, our cultural and our celebrations. We have come a long way in the last 50 years in this country.</span>

I was proud that our allies turned out to support the raising of the flag at Wollongong Council. Personally I fought for this so that young kids knew we had their back. When the Wollongong Lighthouse was lit up the night before the announcement many of my friends were too distressed to come, deeply nervous of the pending vote. For me, seeing the lighthouse in rainbow colours was a defining moment. I felt accepted once again by my community. If only for a brief moment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since the vote we have seen so much hate generated toward the GLBTIQ community. I follow the DIY Rainbow Group on Facebook and some men have had hate filled notes put in their letterbox, murals graffitied and the recent standoff over young people flying the rainbow flag from their home is deeply distressing. We stand today at a moment in history, a defining moment that generations will look back on. The vote has been cast. Our grandchildren's grandchildren, whether they are born Gay or Straight will learn of this moment. On looking back they won't be interested in the wording, I am sure future generations will refine the details. They will look back on how we came together, how we spoke as one voice and said lets finally get something the majority of Australian Citizens have wanted for many years finally done. Let's get the Marriage Equality Bill Passed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="83P" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms JULIE BISHOP</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:59</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill. This bill will enable a change to the Marriage Act to address what has been seen as a matter of unfairness in our community where certain members were unable to marry their partners, the person they loved and with whom they wished to form an enduring bond of marriage. I supported a plebiscite on the question as to whether the Marriage Act should be amended to allow same-sex marriage as I believed that, if the parliament could not determine the matter, then we should give the Australian people an opportunity to have the determinant say on the issue. When the plebiscite legislation was defeated by Labor in the Senate, I supported the mechanism of a postal survey, as I agreed with the Prime Minister that the government should seek to honour the electoral promise we made to the Australian people at the 2016 election that they would have their opportunity to directly express their view on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've not sought to actively campaign or to impose my views on others on this issue, which I have always believed to be a deeply personal matter, but I am pleased that the results of the ABS managed survey sent a clear message that the majority of Australians supported a change to the Marriage Act. While there are a range of views, emotions and sentiments on this issue across our vast continent, it seems many decided that it was a matter of fairness, and fairness goes to the core of our Australian identity. Contrary to the protestations of the critics of the survey, it was an overwhelming success. It was conducted efficiently and the vast majority of participants were respectful. Opposing viewpoints were, in fact, respected. There were some isolated incidents on either side of the campaign, but they should not be seen as representative of the views of the vast majority of people who participated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my state of Western Australia, every single electorate recorded majority support for change. Overall, in my state there was a 78.4 per cent response rate, with 63.7 per cent voting yes. In my electorate of Curtin there was a 72.2 per cent vote in support of change, from an 84 per cent response rate. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the electors of Curtin for their deep interest and their participation in this exercise of democracy Australian style. The outpouring of emotion on the day the results were announced is testament to how much this issue mattered to so many Australians, particularly those directly affected, who have felt the weight of this issue for so long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision of the coalition government to put this matter to the Australian people has been vindicated. The issue should now be settled, and no future government could or should argue that they would have a mandate to repeal this legislation. For some people, the results have been a revelation, as they hadn't expected such strong support for the 'yes' vote. I know from numerous discussions throughout this place that some members believed their electorates to be more socially conservative and that they would not support such a change. However, many of those electorates voted strongly in support of change. There were passionate and vocal advocates on both sides of the debate, and that is why the Australian people deserved a say and why that vote was so important to determine once and for all the level of support for change in the broader community. If this bill passes the House, as I believe it will, Australia will join jurisdictions across the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, Germany, France, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Spain, South Africa and many others who have legislated for same-sex marriage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another aspect to this vote that should be recognised. The Australian Electoral Commission indicated that a record number of Australians enrolled to vote ahead of the pending postal survey on same-sex marriage. An issue that encourages Australians to enrol and to be motivated to have a say in a national debate on a national issue in our political system is a significant benefit. In many ways, this vote has brought our community closer together, in that we have officially acknowledged the legitimacy of all loving relationships. The vote also reaffirms that we are a tolerant, open society with deep respect for those who did not support change, and that's what makes ours an open liberal democracy, committed to freedom, equality and respect for the views of others. I support this private member's bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those people denied the right to marry, their families and their friends, this bill has been a long time coming. I am sorry it has taken this place so long to act and seek to legislate for marriage equality to repair the damage done to equality in this place in 2004. I am sorry for our collective and historic failure to act. I think it is a shame that this chamber—the chamber where government is formed in this country—and this House's representatives have had to be dragged to this happy point. The chamber has been brought here by the leadership of some members in this place and by members in the other place who introduced this legislation and passed this bill first but, for the most part, the Australian community has brought us here, despite the extraordinary weight of the anchor that is the Turnbull government and, before that, the Abbott government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was undoubtedly a very happy moment for this country when the voluntary postal survey demonstrated to this Turnbull government, and its arch conservatives within it, that Australia really does support equality and voted overwhelmingly yes for marriage equality. But this government must be remembered always for what it subjected the people in this country to: a popular postal vote—a survey—to decide on the rights of a minority group. The issues of equality and fairness somehow stopped being a matter of public policy and instead became a matter of public popularity. This government gave this nation a new ridiculous tool of government to save the job of the Prime Minister and, in so doing, brought on a rancorous and sad public debate where television and newspaper adverts sought to scare people out of support for marriage equality and to scare people into doubting and questioning their lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex or queer sisters and brothers in our community. The Turnbull government delivered us a debate that sought to scare people into thinking that if someone else achieves equality and is able to enjoy mores rights then another person might lose rights. That is simply not the case. More people enjoying equality simply means that more people enjoy equality. Equality is not a zero-sum game. It is for sharing, and sharing as widely as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard members of this House tell us how the survey was such a success. I have heard members of this House say things about marriage that have upset me personally. My marriage has been devalued by what they have said here, in newspaper columns and on TV screens across the country. Careless, unthinking and with a distinct lack of generosity of spirit, some conservative lines of thought sadly seem to care little for those who don't fit their traditional ideal of marriage and family. I really wish you'd stop with this compulsion to act as moral guardians. It is tiresome and exhausting, and it is unnecessary. While you continue to speak about how marvellous this strange new tool of your democracy has been—the non-binding voluntary postal survey—spare a thought for those around the country at dinner tables, BBQs and lunches now learning that their mothers, fathers, siblings and loved ones voted no to marriage equality. People, of course, are entitled to respond to a survey with a 'no', but nevertheless there is a sting in the heart of those for whom the marriage equality bill is about their equality and disappointment that their loved ones couldn't share in marriage equality in this high-profile very-public survey. It could have been avoided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western Australia, nearly eight in 10 people participated in this survey, and nearly 64 per cent of them were in favour of marriage equality. In my electorate of Brand, in the south-west metropolitan area of Perth, more than 67 per cent of respondents were in favour of marriage equality. Indeed, out of the 16 federal electoral divisions in WA, all 16 returned a 'yes' majority in the survey. This reflects the norm of the Australian cultural psyche—that we are a fair and equitable country. The overwhelming support for marriage equality in WA demonstrates that my home state of Western Australia is not the socially conservative place that some think it is. WA demonstrated its progressive tendencies and its support for equality. I thank Western Australians for taking part in this survey, although I wish you had not had to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a couple of weeks my husband Jamie and I will celebrate the 18th anniversary of our wedding. At the time I was married in St Joseph's Chapel in Safety Bay 18 years ago, the woman who stood beside me that day, my bridesmaid and my sister, did not enjoy the same rights as me. She will never enjoy the same rights as me in the Catholic Church, but she most certainly should enjoy the same rights as me under the secular laws of this country. Soon enough she will enjoy these rights, as will her friends, who are now also my friends. This is 18 years after we were married. Thanks, Rebecca. I might offer some advice to those who want to get married quickly when the bill is passed in December, a week or so before Christmas—please be warned that your anniversaries, like mine and Jamie's, will be forever caught up with Christmas nonsense. You won't get to celebrate an anniversary quietly ever again because you will be at work drinks or different parties and now as the member for Brand I will be at Christmas carols—and I will be grateful but it does change the dimension, so maybe leave it until next year. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Christmas, an old friend I went to law school with, Brendon Pinch, sent me a Christmas card from London. In it he simply said, 'Madeleine—can I please have gay marriage for Christmas?' It wasn't to be last year, but, Brendon, look what we are doing—it looks like you will get marriage equality for Christmas, so I am looking forward to the invitation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned the faith in which I was raised and I make the brief comment that while this bill upholds the right of all couples to marry it also offers religious protections that some would consider have no place in a secular country such as ours. As I have said before, there is no justification for discrimination and it would be wrong if we looked at ending one form of discrimination by allowing another. I will make no further comment on that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I want to acknowledge the work that has been done to achieve marriage equality over a very long time by the activists that have fought and have really suffered in the minority. They remain in the minority but now have the support at last of their parliament. I want to acknowledge the young Australians that got involved in the process by voting, by volunteering, by marching, by getting on the phones and by talking to their friends and families. This won't be the last time young Australians will be asked to move this country forward. It really is an exciting time to be a young Australian. Once this government is relegated to history, we will be able to progress important national issues about the future of Australia—issues that young Australians care deeply about: reconciliation and agreement making with our Indigenous sisters and brothers who have lived in this country for over 60,000 years and ensuring that a person born here is no longer barred from being the Australian head of state. The young people that I speak with around my electorate, and at my old school at Safety Bay, will grow up with marriage equality. They will live to see Australia become a republic and to see our Indigenous peoples, our first nation peoples, take their rightful place in the Constitution of Australia. We will need the strength of young Australians and their energy to see this through and move this country forward. Marriage equality has been a long time coming in this country, so please let us not delay it any further. To the people of Brand, I thank them for their support, I thank them for voting yes in this survey and I will be voting yes in this parliament.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AMV" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUNT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Minister for Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:13</span>):  It is a great honour to speak tonight to the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. It is one of the great honours that we can all experience within our parliamentary lives. Perhaps the greatest honour of my life has been, is and will always be, however, the fact that Paula agreed to take my hand in marriage and together we have had the privilege of raising two wild, spirited, beautiful children. While we focus most of our time on them, as parents understandably do, the central foundation upon which our family has been built is the marriage between Paula and me—a marriage which was recognised before the law, before the church and, perhaps most importantly, before the community. To this day, I remember the vows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and health, until death do us part.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The vows didn't include the fact that my mother-in-law would live with me. We don't always know what's coming. But that in fact has been one of the great joys of our journey together as a family, being a three-generation family, with Elsa, the classical Italian grandmother—although that does not translate in citizenship terms to the son-in-law!—as part of our family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had the great joy of watching so many of my schoolfriends and friends through life take the vows of marriage for themselves. But not all of my friends have been able to make those same vows. People such as Bruce Meagher and his lifelong partner, Greg, have been denied this choice. My great friend Alex, who is in the box tonight, and others have until now not had that choice. There has been a gap in the Australian story, and the Australian people were asked to express their view on that gap, and the Australian people gave voice to ending that gap in the Australian story and voted yes so that we may be able to vote yes so that every Australian will then have the choice to say yes. We saw the greatest two-party preferred vote equivalent of any effective election we've had in Australia, and that's a sobering and important thought. In my electorate of Flinders the vote was even stronger, at 70 per cent yes. And tonight I commit that I will vote yes, that I will vote to give all Australians the right to choose whom they may wish to marry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also deeply aware and deeply respectful of the fact that many millions of Australians voted no for reasons of deep faith, for reasons of deep belief and for reasons of deep culture. It is important that we respect their views and the views of a nation if we are to build that nation in the best and strongest way. So tonight I want to briefly meditate upon three great freedoms that are part of the Australian story: the freedom to choose, which was expressed through the plebiscite; the freedom to commit, which is the subject of this bill; and the freedom to believe, which will be enshrined in the great protections that are currently in the bill but to which I will support additions through many of the amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the freedom to choose, I have a deep belief in Australian democracy—a profound belief. I take a different view to that expressed by some this evening and others over the course of the last few months. I understand that the plebiscite was controversial, but I believe it was right. This is a deep social change for many. It's a very simple thing for others but a deep and profound change for many. By giving every Australian a say not only do we honour a pledge we made to the Australian people at the last election but also we created a pathway to deep, fundamental and final acceptance that sexuality is no longer a dividing factor in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I doubt that in 30 years there will be many, other than those in this chamber, who will remember where they were when the same-sex marriage laws were passed by the parliament. But I am certain that there will be multitudes who will remember where they were at that moment of great joy when the chief statistician read out the results of the national marriage plebiscite. There was a euphoric joy which was unrivalled and which I doubt I will see rivalled again in the course of the democratic process. In that process, I believe, far from seeing the worst of Australia, we have seen the best of Australia. We saw the best of Australia in the course of the vote and we are seeing the best of the parliament in the course of this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a way, this process was ushered in by some unlikely grooms, four friends of mine, Scott Morrison, Peter Dutton, Mathias Cormann and Tony Abbott. All, in their own way, knew that this course of action was likely to produce this outcome. For none of them was this their preferred outcome, yet all showed the grace and a belief in our democracy to allow, to usher and to support a process that could lead to a different outcome than the cornerstone belief of each of them. For that, I want to honour and thank them, and I honour the views of all those who will vote no. Whilst I differ, they have their right to do so, and, whilst I have come to the conclusion of happily supporting the 'yes' vote and happily voting yes on this bill, I recognise that for many it has been a difficult journey. But their stewardship was critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time there has been a determined group of people for many years supporting same-sex marriage. In particular I wish to acknowledge, on our side, my great friends Warren Entsch and Trent Zimmerman, Tim Wilson, Senator Dean Smith and Trevor Evans, all of whom took courageous steps forward. I do not believe that, in years to come, they will have a single regret about the courage that they showed when it most counted. To all of them and to all of those on both sides who have conducted this debate in good faith, I want to acknowledge you. I want to acknowledge the stewardship of the Prime Minister. He has had a difficult path to tread, but, in the end, same-sex marriage will become law under his stewardship and on his watch, not on anyone else's watch in Australian history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This leads me to the second of our great freedoms, which is the subject of this bill—the freedom to commit. Some years ago, on a night such as this, Warren Entsch, Peter Lindsay and I visited the office of John Howard when he was Prime Minister. We made the case for superannuation rights for same-sex couples. We did so out of a belief that Australia was founded on the principles of both freedom and equality and the teachings of Locke and Burke and Mill and de Tocqueville and so many others that are encapsulated in the words of the great William Hazlitt that 'the love of liberty is the love of others'. We needed to give people freedom, but on this we also needed to ensure equality. That journey reaches its final point in this debate, and the ultimate outcome is not just the legal equality to marry; it is the fundamental and irreversible acceptance which goes forward from this moment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to the third of our freedoms—the freedom to believe. The Constitution of Australia, in section 116, guarantees freedom of religion. The nature of our society, a multifaith, multicultural, multi-ethnic society, demands freedom of religion and freedom to believe. I believe there are strong protections in this bill, but I believe they can be stronger still, in terms of the freedom of speech—but not to hate—in terms of the freedom to determine and in terms of the other great freedoms which have been proposed. I will be supporting those amendments. I will not be supporting the amendment which proposes a dual-tract definition of marriage. For me, that is not the full equality which I believe in and not something I can support. But all of the great freedoms being proposed I will happily support as consistent with the themes that we are examining in this bill: the freedom to choose, the freedom to commit and the freedom to believe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will pass the House on all that has been said, and at that moment I return to where I began. As we close a missing part of the Australian story, I turn to my friends and I say: 'It's your turn now. It's your time. It's your full moment of equality. You have the right to choose.'</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:25</span>):  In speaking on this bill for marriage equality, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, I want people in this place to remember that my home state of Tasmania was actually the last state in this country to decriminalise homosexuality. It was actually finally done only in 1997. Tasmania has come a very long way since that time. In a short period of time, and in the recent non-binding survey, my home state returned a 'yes' vote of 63.6 per cent. Every electorate in my state voted yes. In my own electorate, the vote for 'yes' was 68.8 per cent, but I am not surprised, because, of course, I voted for marriage equality back in this place in 2012. I was one of only 42. I have been re-elected by the good people of Franklin twice since that time. Whilst I accept that not everyone in my electorate will agree with my position, I trust and I hope that they all agree I'm entitled to have a view that is different from them. I also trust that they accept the majority view of the electorate of Franklin, of the state of Tasmania and of the nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this debate and the result, once we vote on this Marriage Act amendment, may be historic and uplifting, we should not ignore the impact that this debate and the survey have had, particularly on LGBTIQ people and their loved ones. I cannot imagine what it would be like to have my life, my relationship, the subject of a national survey. But one of my constituents wrote to me about that, and she said: 'Imagine if you were having dinner or driving or walking with your children past posters which say, "Every child deserves a mother and a father." It might sound innocuous enough, but that message tells every child raised by a same-sex couple, by a single-parent family, a foster carer or grandparent carer that their family is not good enough—wrong and dysfunctional. It tells LGBTIQ young people that they are not worthy of being parents and having a family of their own.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put on record my concerns for the LGBTIQ people and their families. I want to acknowledge the hurt that the survey and the ongoing debate have caused them. I want to say sorry. While the result of the surveys was welcome, the impact of that debate is not. The facts are that there has been a spike in demand for mental health services in recent months as a result of the postal survey and the ongoing debate on changes to the Marriage Act. What it clearly suggests is that people are vulnerable and they feel hurt. It's also clear that they don't want a public debate that judges them, their relationships or their families. That is exactly what we have now got. But the way we vote in this place, this week, will make a difference. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor were in office in 2008 we made significant changes to ensure equality for LGBTIQ Australians in over 80 different pieces of legislation, and we are rightly very proud of that. But we still have this one piece of legislation that remains that discriminates. The Australian public have told us to change it, and so we should. Australia has been a long way behind other Western democracies in legalising same-sex marriage, in removing this inequality. This week we have the chance to catch up. Getting to this point has been difficult. It has taken too long, it has hurt too many, but this is our chance now to right a wrong. This is our chance to make a historic change to ensure that all Australians are finally treated equally when it comes to the right to marry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to again quote one of my constituents, who says: 'I am in a relationship with and live with my beautiful partner. We do want to get married one day and we're at an age where we're frequently attending weddings of our heterosexual friends. It hurts when you're supposed to be excited for your friends, but you have to listen to those words "marriage is between a man and a woman, to the exclusion of all others". I feel a pang of pain every time, followed by guilt for being upset and thinking about myself on my friend's wedding day. I always thought that marriage equality would be achieved by the time I was ready to get married, but as each year passes I get more and more doubtful.' I want to say to my constituent: that time is nearly here. We are almost there. What we now need to do is to ensure that some people are not given the right to continue to discriminate as we deal with these amendments to the Marriage Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all of those campaigners, particularly in my electorate, who have worked so hard to get us to this point. To all of those families in my electorate that have been hurt by this debate, again I say sorry. My electorate voted overwhelmingly for equality. My home state has voted overwhelmingly for equality. Our country has voted overwhelmingly for equality. It is time we just got this done. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:30</span>):  I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill. The 2016 election saw, for the first time, an Australian government elected with a mandate to provide a path to marriage equality. We now find ourselves one step away from the end of that path. The postal survey is the reason we are at this point today. I believe it was the right direction for us to take to bring about such significant social change, giving ownership of the decision not to some 226 politicians in this place but to all Australians—to have their say. The leadership from Tony Abbott whilst he was Prime Minister on the policy to hold a plebiscite on this very important social change continued under the leadership of Prime Minister Turnbull, and both of them must be commended for their leadership. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With a national turnout nudging 80 per cent, this process we undertook has now been vindicated. The scare campaign from those opposite and their assorted friends on the Left about a divisive and vitriolic debate did not come true. So I thank the Australian public for having their say on this very important issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite their enthusiastic embrace of this result, it should be noted that those opposite opposed the bill to conduct the plebiscite in the first place. And, despite their rhetoric this week and leading up to this week, we must not forget they did precious little to advance this cause during their time in government. Very disappointingly, they are paying lip service to conscience by denying their members a free vote on amendments. The Australian Labor Party do not occupy the moral high ground on this issue, despite their posturing. History will show it was this side of the parliament that brought about same-sex marriage. It is right and proper that this institution is extended and strengthened under the coalition, and I extend my welcome to all same-sex couples around Australia who can now, upon the finalisation of this bill, have their relationship recognised and registered by the state as a union between two people, to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard much about the amendments that will be introduced in the House relating to a variety of matters, such as having multiple definitions of marriage, conscientious objection by civil celebrants, the right to freedom of expression and protections for that expression, protection of charities, shields against detrimental conduct by public officials and protections for parents' rights to withdraw their children from certain classes. I am particularly concerned about parental rights in a school setting being protected, and I do look forward to the introduction of amendments that address those concerns. While the public may expect us to get on with the job of legislating same-sex marriage—and I expect that will happen well and truly before Christmas, by the end of this week—they also expect us to keep delivering all other facets of good government. I look forward to continuing to do so. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Durack's participation rate in the postal survey was the lowest turnout in Western Australia, which I do believe shows that, although this is an important issue in my electorate, it is not necessarily a top-order issue, and I do respect that and respect the people in Durack. Turnout in Durack was lowest amongst those aged 18 to 24, with only 53 per cent participating in the postal survey. Interestingly enough, participation increased through each age group, with those aged 65 and over having the highest turnout, with some 83 per cent. I think this tells us that there were a large number of older Australians in my electorate of Durack who voted yes. I think a lot of people would be very surprised at that, given the demographics of Durack or what people expect of the demographics of Durack. I personally voted yes in the postal survey and will do likewise when we vote on this bill. I do so with the backing of the majority of Australian respondents, a majority of Western Australian respondents and a majority of respondents in my electorate of Durack, with some 59 per cent of those who voted voting yes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2015, the town of Port Hedland passed a local law to use its limited legislative power to formally recognise same-sex unions. You wouldn't expect a town in the Pilbara to pass such local laws or to be so progressive, given it's dominated by its harsh landscape and wall-to-wall fly-in fly-out workers, so I congratulate them on that. The first Hedland couple who took the opportunity to have their relationship formally recognised were my friend Gloria and her partner, Nicky. With the passing of the same-sex marriage legislation this week, Gloria and Nicky will be able to be legally married. I know that will be a very happy day and I will be the first to congratulate them. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="129164" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:36</span>):  Members of this House and the other place have spoken with eloquence and passion and from lived experience on this issue. The bravery and the work of campaigners over many years has been applauded. The deeply negative impacts of the postal survey on human dignity and mental health have been aired and explained. The shibboleths of extremism have been countered, and those who misused faith as a weapon of discourse have been exposed for the charlatans they are. The personal stories of sadness, sweetness, bitterness, hope, anger and joy have been told. Given the lateness of the hour, I will not seek to go over ground that has been well tilled, but I do exhort members to take the time to read the speeches that have already been delivered. Some speeches reflect this parliament at its best and some don't. I especially note that of the member for Gellibrand earlier this evening, whose sentiments and mixed feelings about this process reflect those of my own. Like him, I celebrate what I hope will be the passage of this bill in the next few hours, but I regret the hurtful journey that it's taken to get us here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the substance of the bill and whether to vote yea or nay, for me the test is as simple as it gets. I believe fundamentally and unequivocally that every Australian deserves equal treatment under Australian law. So, for me, the only vote can be yea. I'm delighted that this is a view shared by the majority of my electorate, a region of small regional communities. I had a taste of how my electorate might be faring during the election campaign last year. I was at an election forum. The then Liberal member, the Greens candidate and I were on stage in Longford, which is a fairly socially conservative part of my electorate. We were taking questions from a fairly packed house of constituents. I was given a question by a Tasmanian Senate candidate who was the wife of Reverend Fred Nile on my views on marriage equality. Looking out upon that sea of faces, I had a choice to make. The choice was: do I answer this with politics in mind—keeping in mind that I'm in a socially conservative part of my electorate—or do I answer this from the heart? I chose to answer from the heart. I said, 'I will vote for marriage equality in the Australian parliament, and I'll do that for these reasons,' being the reasons I have outlined here. To my surprise, to be honest, and to the surprise of the other people on the stage, my answer was met with loud applause from the community. I wouldn't say the town hall erupted, but the applause was loud. Indeed, to his credit, the then member, Mr Hutchinson, when I sat down after giving my answer, said to me, 'Well done!'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that opened a window to the people of Lyons and, frankly, to regional communities throughout Australia, because I think the vast majority of regional communities, as the member for Durack just alluded to, voted yes in the postal survey. People in regional communities are stereotyped as somehow being not with it, not with the times. It's not true. People in regional communities are fair-minded. I'm confident that marriage equality has not been a first-order issue for the vast majority of people across my electorate, but I am equally confident that the vast majority of people across Lyons are fundamentally fair-minded. That was reflected in the outcome of the postal survey. The people of my electorate would have preferred this issue to have been dealt with long ago. They ask: 'Why haven't you guys dealt with it? Why haven't you guys done the job you're being paid to do, which is to make decisions you're elected to make?' I couldn't agree more. I do hope that this matter is settled if not today then tomorrow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Australia in the postal survey voted to extend and expand rights, not to entrench discrimination, so it is my hope that this House rejects the amendments that some members seek to attach to this bill. This bill should be about extending the same rights to all Australians, not seeking to disenfranchise some Australians even further. I would like to pay tribute to Rainbow Labor and Young Labor in Tasmania for the work they did during the campaign. I pay tribute to the work of Rodney Croome and that of Australian Marriage Equality. There are many others who have helped bring this day about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I say this to my brother Kieron and his partner, Simon: you are loved, and today I think of you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:42</span>):  I thank the member for Hughes for his good grace in allowing me to jump in briefly for a short contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have listened with interest to a number of the contributions to this debate, and they have been by passionate people with personal connections and long-held views on both sides of the argument. As the member for Hinkler, I find myself in a challenging position. Of the 80,197 ballots returned in the federal seat of Hinkler for the postal survey, the count was 40,649 for the 'yes' case and 39,548 for the 'no' case, a difference of just 551 primary votes would have changed the result. Approximately 23,000 constituents did not take the opportunity to have their say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we consider the national result against the House of Representatives' 150 members, 61.6 per cent voting for would result in 92 members on the 'yes' side, and 38.4 per cent voting against would result in 58 members on the 'no' side. Clearly, the result has not been unanimous; however, it has been absolutely a vote for the 'yes' case. But I also want to acknowledge that these are just numbers and statistics in a matter which is deeply personal for many people. I did listen to the contribution today by Andrew Wallace, the member for Fisher, who is clearly conflicted as a devout Catholic with personal connections in his own family and the challenges he has found, and the contribution of Linda Burney, the member for Barton, who has absolutely been through a horrible personal issue only recently. I do acknowledge just how deeply personal this matter is for many Australians. However, the penultimate decision has been made. The Australian people have decided by a majority that same-sex marriage will be legislated in this country, and I have no doubt that the bill will be passed by the House of Representatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate I have supported the 'no' case consistently through two elections. I supported the postal survey. I held a consistent position throughout the public debate that I would vote no in the postal survey. However, I did not engage in pushing either side of the debate during that survey, because my view was quite simply that my constituents would make up their own minds. I have to say, it would be a lot easier if the vote had been a bit stronger one way or the other. It was almost literally fifty-fifty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the survey results were announced I have clearly and consistently said that my vote in this place, as the federal member for Hinkler, would be—as it always is—based on the bill and the details of the bill. I know a number of members of the LGBTI community. They have spoken to me personally about marriage, and I consider a number of them to be my friends. I've also had discussions with those on the other side of the debate concerned about religious freedoms, parental choice and the right for them to raise their children as they see fit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not as eloquent as many in this House. If I can use the vernacular: I don't have a horse in the race. I was raised in the Catholic faith. I attended public schools. I was married in the Catholic Church. I believe in the sacrament of marriage. I can't claim to be a devout churchgoer. You won't find me every six o'clock on a Saturday evening or 9 am on a Sunday at mass. In fact, recalling the preparations for my own marriage, the priest said to me at the time that he thought, in relation to my church attendance, that I might be having a dollar each way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've stated, this debate is about the bill and its details. Many members have spoken in this place about religious protections and freedom of speech, and I don't intend to restate or reprosecute those cases. I'll be supporting the proposed amendments for religious freedoms when they are introduced. I think it's critical that the four million Australians who did vote no not only are represented in this place but have their views protected in this bill. I acknowledge the Prime Minister's statement that Philip Ruddock will conduct a review and provide recommendations for consideration, but I can only make decisions based on the bill that is before the House. So my final decision to support or otherwise this bill will not be a reflection of the survey results or a reflection of those who've successfully lobbied for a change to the Marriage Act, because the change will take place. It will be simply a reflection on the bill which is before the House and a view as to whether it does or does not adequately address the concerns of many in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm aware of the opportunity to abstain from the vote, but I'm one of those in this place who believe you should always have the courage of your convictions. I look forward to seeing the bill in its final form so I can make an informed decision, an informed choice, on the amendments or otherwise.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="243609" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:46</span>):  I support the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 because it is the means to make marriage equality a reality in Australia and to advance the cause of equality. I will endeavour, in this contribution, to be brief. I do not wish to delay the passage of this bill and the enactment into law of equality when it comes to marriage, but there are some things I would like to say about marriage, equality and democracy. I have some thankyous, too. It is somewhat like a wedding speech, perhaps, in that regard!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On marriage, the enactment of this bill into law would mean one thing: that all of us would be able to marry the person we love. For those of us who have been able to have our relationship recognised at law as marriage, it's a big deal. It certainly means a lot to me, to Jill, my wife—I hope!—to our families and to those who we were able to share the occasion of our wedding with. That a previous parliament took steps directly to deny this to Australians by reason of who they are is not only regrettable but shameful. I'm pleased that this parliament should rectify this wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bill about marriage, but of course those who are opposed to marriage equality have seemed determined to talk about everything except that. The amendments to this bill which are foreshadowed deal with a range of matters which have very little to do with the real substance of the bill before us, regardless of its somewhat misleading title. Indeed, I find the reference that's often made to religious protections confusing as well as not particularly to the point. Perhaps I'm missing something here, but I don't understand who is being protected from what when this proposition is put forward. I say this: the reason that those who are opposed to marriage equality don't talk about it choose not to do so because it is very hard to argue against.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This takes me to equality. I say this: that one group of Australians can be subject to different and lesser treatment at law is, to me, unconscionable. In my first speech in this place, I committed myself to fight, as best I could, for equality. I also committed myself to support equality when it comes to marriage. I did so again at the last election. I will commit myself in casting my vote on this bill, when I have the opportunity to pursue those endeavours, but I will also commit myself beyond that point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about democracy briefly. I felt a wave of relief and then joy amongst the crowd at the State Library in Melbourne when the result of the postal survey was announced. But I then said to myself, and I say now: let's get real; that survey was borne of weakness and trashed both our democratic traditions and the rights of LGBTI Australians. I support representative democracy, and I had thought it was a shared belief in this place, including across the aisle. Even the hardest decisions should not require legislators to contract out their responsibilities, and this, I submit, is not a hard decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch very briefly on the human consequences of this craven cop-out. I do so because, frankly, I am offended by some of the self-congratulatory contributions of government members about the success of the postal survey. I ask them to consider an article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> today, by Paul Karp, which points to some of the impact the survey has had on too many members of the LGBTI community, in terms of both mental health and, indeed, physical assaults occasioned at least in part by reason of this craven cop-out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In talking about the journey to marriage equality, I reflect also on the journey that my party has taken in this regard. This has not been as smooth or as rapid as it should have been. Labor took too long to embrace marriage equality, and we were wrong to delay. I've been reflecting on this. I recall in particular a moment when I failed to press the case for change, when I went along with a sense of 'now is not the time'. It is a moment I have long regretted. Whenever we have the opportunity to act to end injustice, those of us who have the capacity must do so. So I acknowledge the courage of those who fought for marriage equality within Labor when this was a hard fight. I think particularly of Sarah Cole and Holly Cooper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reflect on the process more recently as well. I am pleased that the electorate of Scullin resolved to support the yes vote, but I'm aware that many thousands of my constituents took a different view. Should marriage equality be enacted, I will endeavour to engage with those who voted no, to work through their concerns—to see if this can be a moment of healing—and to relieve some of their anxieties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I tender some acknowledgements. I think Tim Gartrell is owed a debt of gratitude by many Australians for his work. In this campaign and more broadly he's steered the ship. In my home state I think of the contribution of the wonderful Wil Stracke and her team at the Victorian Trades Hall Council, amazing, inspiring and tireless activists. I think of the Victorian government and acknowledge the endeavours of the Premier, the Minister for Equality and Ro Allen, Victorian Commissioner for Gender and Sexuality. I think of the thousands of grassroots activists, in particular those who paved the way many, many years before they would have thought this parliament enacting a law for marriage equality was a prospect. I think of Jamie Gardiner, an inspiration to me for many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly acknowledge at a personal level the powerful advocacy of Rainbow Families, who reminded me of the difference between understanding something intellectually and feeling it viscerally. Rainbow Labor has transformed our party and, I think, gone some way to transforming our country. I acknowledge my colleagues in the Senate: my friend Penny Wong, who inspires me every day, and my dear friend of many years Senator Louise Pratt, who has been here from the very start in this debate. In this place, the Leader of the Labor Party has shown consistency and conviction, with the deputy leader, the shadow Attorney-General and my dear friend the member for Griffith, who has led the fight in the parliament and in the community with her customary sangfroid and passion for equality. I acknowledge also the member for Whitlam, who put forward a motion in the previous parliament, and Laura Smyth, the former member for La Trobe, who was a tireless advocate while she had the chance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, I pay tribute here to the courage of ordinary LGBTIQ Australians, because this is about you, for you and because of you. For some years now I've kept a postcard, a marriage photo, on my desktop in parliament. I committed to keeping it there until marriage equality became law and the ceremony could be recommitted and rendered properly lawful. I'm thinking of you guys now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that for so long we let you down. I'm sorry that, for too many, today, tomorrow or Thursday is too late. I hope, though, that this week in this place we can draw a pretty hard line and say that in Australia, from now and forever forward, love is love and that equality can no longer be regarded as negotiable.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:55</span>):  Tonight, at this late hour, as the clock approaches 11 pm, I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. In my electorate of Hughes, the vote came back 58 per cent for and 42 per cent no. Therefore, I'll be voting yes on this particular bill. I acknowledge, pay credit to and congratulate my colleagues that advocated for the 'yes' case. They advocated with conviction, they advocated strongly and, ultimately, they were successful. To every same-sex couple that is now intending to get married I wish all the best. With their expenditure, we may see a further boom and a further pick-up in our economy, if everyone that we hear plans to get married does so early in the new year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to make a few comments on the process that led us here. It was the coalition's election policy to have a plebiscite if we were successful at the last election. It's been disappointing through this debate that some have used this to attack each other on a partisan basis, especially many in this chamber who have said, 'Just get on with it.' Many of those same people sat on this side of the House for six years, when they had control of the Senate, and they could have changed the laws on same-sex marriage any day, but for six years they didn't, and now they come into this chamber and they criticise the coalition for 'not getting on with it'. They were the same people that also voted against the plebiscite, which could have been held in February this year. So same-sex marriage, about which everyone is saying, 'Get on with it,' could have been lawful if the Senate had passed that plebiscite and allowed that to go ahead in February. We'd be a good 10 months down the track, and there would have been many same-sex couples married in 2017. Instead they will be married in 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other reason that I believe the postal vote was the correct way to go is that it gave every single Australian a say in this process. One thing I found about the many same-sex couples that I know is that ultimately they want acceptance and recognition from the rest of society. That's what I believe the successful 'yes' vote gave them. Many people that were opposed to same-sex marriage, having had their say, having voted no and having seen that they lost that vote, will now be much more accepting of same-sex marriage in our society than they would ever have been had the legislation simply been rammed through the parliament. So I think we can say that, yes, the process that got us here was long and arduous but it was a successful process that I believe ultimately will give those same-sex couples that are getting married the greatest respect and the greatest recognition across our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also, by its title, discusses religious freedoms. Therefore, it's quite pertinent that the issues of religious freedoms are discussed in this debate. The question is: where should we actually draw the line? Where should we draw the line between where it is unlawful to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation and someone's religious freedoms? That is a fair question, and I am not sure in my mind exactly where that line should be drawn. But I agree there should be a line. For example, should an imam have the right to decide who they will and will not marry in a mosque? Where should we set the line there? Should a priest in a Catholic church have the right to decide who they will and will not marry? What about a registered marriage celebrant of an independent religious organisation? Should they have the right to decide who they will or will not marry? What about a marriage celebrant who holds very strong religious convictions? Should they be forced against their will to marry someone? This is a question of where we should draw the line. What about a master of ceremonies, an MC at weddings, who holds very strong religious beliefs? Should we have legislation that takes away their right to decide at what weddings they will be an MC? What about a musician or a singer who holds strong religious views? Should they be forced to perform at a particular event if it's against their religious conscience or beliefs? Then we get on to the famous case of the cake maker in the USA. I think if someone is supplying a plain wedding cake—or perhaps that is further than where the line should go. What if that wedding cake is actually decorated with certain messages, with the argument that it is an artistic work?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not saying I have the answers to these questions. That's why I support the process of the former member for Berowra, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, to look through these matters. We should discuss this in an open and civilised debate without any name-calling and without any bad faith on either side to work out where we should draw the line between religious freedoms and what is conduct that is unlawful discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I do have some concerns with the existing bill, and this goes to the list on the Attorney-General's Department's website on finding a marriage celebrant. Currently there are three main categories. The first category is Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants who perform civil ceremonies, the second is marriage celebrants who perform religious ceremonies for independent religious organisations, and the third is all ministers of recognised denominations who perform religious ceremonies. Under the proposed bill, the second and third categories will be given their religious freedom. They will have the right to decide which weddings they will and will not preside over. I think that's correct. However, the first category, the Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants who perform civil ceremonies, will have 90 days to make a declaration about whether they want to go on a separate list where they can opt out of performing all weddings. I have great concerns with that proposal. I have great concerns about a government having a list of people who hold a minority opinion on any particular area, especially when someone who goes on that list has no protections from harassment or vilification.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My other concern is that, if we are going to have religious freedoms, an important part of religious freedoms is the ability to change one's beliefs over time. Someone may hold many different positions throughout their life on religion and their religious beliefs. That is a fundamental basis of our free and open society: that someone can freely decide to change their beliefs without risk of sanction, threats, intimidation or harassment from anyone. The problem that we have by having a 90-day period, a 90-day window, where celebrants who perform civil ceremonies can transfer, is that if someone who is registered as a civil marriage celebrant changes their mind after 90 days we are prohibiting them from going on that list. We are denying them their rights to change their religious beliefs and to go on that list. That is something that I cannot support. Also, as I said, I am greatly concerned that there is no ability for someone in the future to decide that they want to go on that list. The only people that can go on that list are civil marriage celebrants who are currently on the list and who do so within 90 days. This is something that I also have great concerns about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I have concerns is that we have seen in our society recently a very disturbing tendency by some groups to use threats, violence, harassment and intimidation against those who hold a different opinion. This is why I believe that those who hold what is now a minority religious view in this country on the issue of same-sex marriage deserve some religious protections. I will be listening to many of my colleagues during this debate. I think these amendments put forward by colleagues in the coalition were done in good faith, and they should be considered in good faith. I hope they are debated that way. I will be reserving my right to support those amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I commend the bill as it stands. I'll still be voting for it—even though I have expressed my reservations—as my electorate voted for it. Again, I truly wish all of those couples, same-sex marriage couples, who will have a wedding in the New Year the best for the future, and may they enjoy long and happy marriages.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">23:07</span>):  The people have spoken. Over 7.8 million or 61.6 per cent of eligible Australians voted yes for marriage equality. Over 80 per cent of eligible voters participated in the postal survey. I am proud to stand here today as the member for Blair, based in the Ipswich and Somerset region, because 60 per cent of the people in my electorate voted yes, and I was one of them. We voted yes because it was a vote for love and against discrimination. We voted to treat people in the LGBTIQ community—our neighbours, our families and our friends—the same as ourselves. This postal survey was unnecessary, hurtful, divisive and expensive; however, the result validated what many already-published polls said: that Australians overwhelmingly support marriage equality. I am certain that the Turnbull government's postal survey was a delaying tactic and a way to paper over government divisions. Here we are now, doing what we should have done a long time ago: having a vote in parliament. Last week the Senate dealt with this bill, and now we are doing our duty and voting in this place on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only in the last generation have we seen the decriminalisation of homosexuality. This has been achieved in the statute books in all of the states and territories. Only in the last decade has discrimination in most areas of the economic and social life of the nation been ended, usually under a Labor government, in this place and elsewhere. Our country continues to change, as do the institutions of marriage and family. In my career as a family lawyer, I saw people in all different types of families who were good parents and those who were not. I learnt the most important thing for children is to grow up in an atmosphere where they are loved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can understand why some of those in the minority voted no based on their faith. I respect their views, often deeply held, but, respectfully, I disagree with them. I am a Christian and a member of my local Baptist church. I have thought long and hard about the issue of marriage equality, and prayerfully considered this matter. In my faith, God is love, and the second greatest commandment is to 'love your neighbour as yourself'. I was left asking myself the question: 'What is the loving thing to do?' I believe it is to affirm love and sanction love, to have love sanctioned by law in marriage; to see love expressed in words of commitment among friends and family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the greatest days in my life was when I pledged my love and loyalty to my wife, Carolyn, on my wedding day. I want to see the LGBTIQ community be afforded the same rights I have so couples in committed, loving relationships can make the same pledge I made. In no way does this diminish my marriage, nor does it demean the institution of marriage. There are many Christians—Protestants, like me, Pentecostals, Catholics and other denominations—who voted yes in the postal survey and supported marriage equality, defying the officially defined positions of their denominations. I am one of the dissidents. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the end, I think this is a simple issue, an issue about love and equality. I cannot vote for the various amendments to be proposed in the House, which were voted down in the Senate. It would be a repudiation of the emphatic vote for 'yes' both in my electorate of Blair and in wider Australia, including my home state of Queensland. Like many people in Blair and across Australia, my views about marriage equality have evolved over time. Before the last federal election I told voters in my electorate that I would vote for marriage equality if they re-elected me. I declared this openly. I said it in media interviews. I shared it with anyone who asked me what my position was. I even, clearly, stated my views and support for marriage equality in a debate hosted by the Australian Christian Lobby. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016 I was re-elected with the largest margin I had ever achieved in my 10 years in this place. That margin was 8.9 per cent. But that vote was surpassed even further by the 10 per cent margin in the Blair electorate in the postal survey and the 11.6 per cent margin nationally achieved by the 'yes' campaign. If 61.6 per cent of the vote of the 'yes' campaign were replicated in a federal election, the governing party's benches would stretch right across here and probably behind me. That's how overwhelming the impact would be for the 61.6 per cent vote. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I respect the concerns of those held by people of faith who voted no in the postal survey, but I want to assure them there are protections in this bill. This bill is a cross-party compromise. The protections specified in this bill, in proposed section 47(3), include:</span>

You have shared with me your personal stories and your desire to be respected and have equal rights. I have heard your voices and I want to thank you for your courage in speaking up and speaking out.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CREWTHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">23:16</span>):  I am honoured tonight to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017. I would like to recognise the coalition government, who, firstly, initiated the process to give the Australian people their say and then followed through by putting this bill before parliament to implement the will of the Australian people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The view of the Australian people was emphatic, both nationally and in Dunkley. Nationally the result was 61.6 per cent yes from those who exercised their democratic right to have their say, the national participation rate being 79.5 per cent. In my electorate of Dunkley the result was even higher, with 72 per cent saying yes, the 19th highest out of 150 electorates across Australia. In addition, the participation rate was also higher than nationally, with Dunkley participation being at 81.7 per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were some other interesting statistics that came out of the postal survey, those being that, by party, 63.3 per cent in majority Liberal seats, 61.7 per cent in majority Labor seats, 59.8 per cent in majority LNP seats and 56.8 per cent in majority National seats said yes. Indeed, of the 'no' vote electorates, 11 are held by Labor, four by the Liberals, one by the Nationals and one by the Katter party. So it appears that Liberal voters in general favoured a yes vote. Given the coalition brought to the 2016 election a promise to give the Australian people their say over the issue, I backed this decision both during and after the election. I believe in being consistent and in keeping promises. I also note that Labor had six years in government to take action on this issue but didn't put the issue to the people and/or the parliament. It is a Liberal coalition government that took action resulting in this bill today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Irrespective of one's views on holding this postal survey, I do note one clear benefit. It has made clear the majority view of Australians who wanted to have their say in a postal vote. That then strengthens parliament in now changing the Marriage Act in line with the outcome, such that parliament cannot be accused of not implementing the will of the Australian people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the substantive issue, my position has been consistent for many years, including in my maiden speech, where I said I would be a strong advocate for freedom. In essence, notwithstanding my own views on Christian marriage, I support the freedom of any two consenting adults to marry under secular state law. At the same time I also support the freedom of any person to express their own religious or personal views on the issue of marriage and not to be forced to act or express a view against their own conscience. On supporting the freedom of any two people to marry under state law, I made my view clear in my maiden speech. I stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am a Liberal because I support freedom and liberty …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I added:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A … state should not impose any religion or world view, such as Christianity, Islam or atheism. Nor should a state restrict the practice of any religion or world view. It should allow freedom of religion, including freedom to express one's views, critique and criticise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should note that I am a practising Christian. As a person of Christian faith, I believe that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman. Having said that, I do recognise that this biblical interpretation is not consistent across all Christian denominations or even within denominations; although it still remains the majority view within Christianity. But this debate is not about biblical interpretations. In implementing equality under the law, I have always favoured the minimal government approach of changing the Marriage Act to a relationships act, with the Commonwealth getting out of the business of defining marriage and only legislating as to the contractual relationship between two people. This would have created equality under the law, while, in my view, better protect freedoms of religion, belief, conscience and speech. While my preference still remains for the state not to legislate as to marriage, I recognise that we have chosen to go down the path of extending the definition of marriage under state law as the way to implement a majority 'yes' vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As parliamentarians, in doing so we are legislating as to state-defined marriage; we are not legislating as to Christian marriage, which I believe is, can be and should remain able to be defined differently from state marriage. In line with my belief in freedom, under the principles of classical liberalism, I stated that, while I have my own Christian personal views on marriage, I would be voting yes in the postal survey to allow for same-sex marriage under state law. I believe this is a position that many Christians like myself took up—distinguishing between Christian marriage and state marriage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I always like to put the shoe on the other foot, so let's consider a hypothetical—that state law says that marriage is only between two consenting adults of the same sex, restricting Christians of the opposite sex from marrying under state law. If that were the case, I would also expect people to support a change in state law to not restrict the definition of marriage and to allow for equality under the law for people of the opposite sex to marry. The same reasoning can apply to expanding the definition of marriage to allow for same-sex marriage. In the same way, under state law we do not impose Christian biblical morality as to divorce, adultery, sex before marriage and so forth. We distinguish between the two. This does not mean that Christians do not, cannot or should not hold these views personally, implement them in their own lives or express those views publicly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having voted yes in the postal survey, I also noted that I would support the majority will of the people in parliament. In accordance with the will of people of Dunkley and Australia, I will also be voting yes in parliament. I know how important a 'yes' vote is for many individuals who might wish to marry or at least have the right to marry in Australia. This includes a number of colleagues, family members, former housemates, friends, schoolmates and people in my electorate of Dunkley. I do not underestimate what a 'yes' vote means for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, I also publicly stated that I would be firmly advocating that any subsequent legislation following a 'yes' vote by the Australian people provides strong protections for freedom of speech and religion, which are absolutely crucial in a liberal democracy. These are freedoms that our Constitution provides only limited protection for and can be changed and reduced by this or a future parliament by a simple majority vote. As such, while supporting the freedom of any two people to marry by voting yes, I will also be supporting amendments put to this bill to provide strong protections for religious liberty and freedoms of conscience, speech and belief. I will not sway away from my consistent belief in freedom, even if it is unpopular. I personally believe that protections should not only include exemptions but should also provide proactive protections of freedoms. Essentially, I support an individual's freedom to express their religious or personal views and not be forced to act or express views against those beliefs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend Senator Dean Smith in putting forward his bill and the efforts of the Senate selection committee members, including for the way that they have conducted themselves during this debate. But I believe protections under this bill must go further, including for churches, other religious bodies and practitioners, such as religious ministers, celebrants, lay preachers and personnel, whether in meetings, proselytisation or expressing views privately or in public; for religious schools; for organisations set up on the basis of religious principles, including charities; for the press; for individuals expressing their religious and personal views in their everyday lives, employment and so on; for parents in terms of their parental choice for their children on what they are taught; and for business owners or organisations when asked to send out a message they disagree with. For example, an LGBTIQ publisher should be able to refuse to print a book advocating for Christian marriage, and a Christian, Islamic or other religious publisher should equally be able to refuse to print a book advocating for marriage equality. That is, people should be able to freely express their religious and personal views in a peaceful manner under our liberal democracy. Equally, people should not be forced to express, adopt, remain silent about or participate in a view that they cannot, in their conscience, agree with. These were freedoms fought for by our forebears in wars and in debates in the halls of our parliaments. These are freedoms that should be supported by anyone, even if they disagree with what a person is saying. As Evelyn Beatrice Hall said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe the amendments being moved are realistic and reasonable in giving strong protections and safeguards to Australians above that provided in the current bill, while not allowing for discrimination against anyone. That is why I am happy to put my consistent support for freedom into action by not only voting yes on the bill but by supporting the amendments and seconding one of the protection amendments being moved. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also notable is that 38 faith leaders from across Australia have drafted an open letter to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition expressing their concerns about the need for more protections in the current bill. In addition, surveys point to the fact that the majority of Australians support these freedoms. In one recent survey, 60 per cent of respondents supported the right of churches and ministers of religion to say no to conducting same-sex marriage ceremonies, 61 per cent supported the ability of parents to say no to certain teaching content for their children in primary schools, 53 per cent supported the ability of people who believe in marriage between a man and a woman to speak freely, and 59 per cent supported business owners and faith based charities to hold and practise their beliefs. I am therefore pleased to be supporting the majority will of the Australian people, both in voting yes to legalise same-sex marriage and also in voting to protect freedoms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are protections that should be supported by my fellow parliamentarians on both sides. It is disappointing that those in the opposition have not been allowed by their leaders, as it currently stands, to express their free will and conscience on amendments being put forward. They must follow the party line. In contrast, our party, the party of freedom, has allowed free will in putting forward and supporting or not supporting any amendments. At the same time, I will not support any amendments that could frustrate or potentially frustrate the process of this bill being implemented by the parliament. I will be focusing on substantive amendments. I will also vote yes irrespective of whether the amendments get through, to implement, in line with the outcome of the survey, the 'yes' result to change the legislation to allow for same-sex marriage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have promised the Australian people we will implement this bill before Christmas, and I will ensure that occurs. I am also cognisant that the likelihood of the protection amendments getting through is minimal, but we must try, as protecting all freedoms is critical. I hope I am wrong and that my fellow parliamentarians will support some or all of the amendments. In any event, I am pleased that the Hon. Philip Ruddock has been appointed by the Prime Minister to lead a review into religious protections, and that the Prime Minister himself has indicated his support for a number of amendments. I hope that Mr Ruddock's review can also recommend legislative changes to support wider protections for free speech and freedoms of religion that can be implemented in the new year, such as charter protections of our freedoms and liberties, as I suggested in my maiden speech. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, I have adopted my position in both voting yes and supporting protections because I support freedom. It was on the basis of these principles that I joined the Liberal Party. In summary, as a person of religious faith, I support the freedom of any two consenting adults to marry under state law. Equally, I encourage those in favour of any two consenting adults marrying to support the freedoms of those with religious faith under state law, and I encourage my colleagues on all sides to do the same, because, as Maximilian II said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">God alone rules the consciences of men: man only rules man.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">23:28</span>):  What a privilege it is to finally come to this moment—at a late hour, indeed—in this debate and in this national story. My own personal experience of this, I guess, is probably representative of many in this country. I grew up in an intensely homophobic environment, as I know many of us did in that time and period. I grew up in an extremely strict Christian household with an extremely strict Christian upbringing, so I know the Book inside out. From there, I was playing Rugby and Rugby League with a generation that quite often openly used that shocking, jarring phrase—as we regard it now—'poofter bashing'. The experiences that we saw at that time, when those sorts of things occurred, and the lack of community mobilisation to respond to them, can't be imagined now, thankfully. Then I joined an army that actually made same-sex relationships illegal. They were a criminal offence in the Defence Force. Great investigative resources were dedicated to rooting out those issues, and people who were discovered to have those sexual orientations were quite often dealt with in an extremely rough or even violent way in their service or time in the Defence Force. What a journey we have been on there to today, where we see ADF personnel marching in Mardi Gras, and we embrace and accept that difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The transition of the social norms of this country has been a long personal journey for me, but the political journey has also been one of great drama. In 2007, when revolutionary transformations of our legislative framework were achieved by the Rudd and Gillard governments, something like 85 pieces of legislation were amended to eliminate all forms of discrimination. That was one of the issues that had to be clarified in this debate. Many people that I engaged with often thought that this proposal encompassed issues around the status and handling of children and other factors, but we were able to disabuse them of those misconceptions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That vote on the legislation in 2012 is the one that stands out most to me. A lot of people said to me at the time that, representing a rural and regional seat, as I do, there was no way I could stand for supporting marriage equality, same-sex marriage: 'You will be slaughtered in Eden-Monaro; they won't put up with that.' There were many on my own side of politics who leaned on me heavily in that respect and made those statements and comments to me. I also remember vividly sitting on the side of the chamber in favour of that legislation and seeing many of my colleagues across the other side of the aisle, including our leadership. I felt at the time, though, that I had to live according to the principles that formed the basis on which I came into this chamber. One of those is that I have to pass the shaving mirror test when I leave this place and that I have to follow my conscience on things that are fundamental to that conscience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Christian principles that I was taught when I grew up framed much of the basis for my being here in the first place. Issues of social justice and protecting the weak are well enunciated in the philosophy of Christ, which is about loving one's neighbour and treating those as you would have them treat you. Christ was one of those people who led the way in re-educating a generation of people who'd grown up living on a survival-of-the-fittest type framework, changing concepts and mindsets towards appreciating the need to protect minorities and those of diverse backgrounds from social exclusion. He reached out to those who were excluded by others in society. I don't see, in any of his teachings, any support for discrimination against the people in same-sex relationships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also came to appreciate that this has been with us since the dawn of time. Since the human species existed, there has always been homosexuality. It's as natural as any other biological aspect of our being. I, and many others who are old enough, remember a time when people who were left-handed were treated as people with anomalies that needed to be corrected and who were disciplined and punished for being left-handed. In many cases physical punishment was exerted. We now obviously accept that that's just a natural occurrence. Left-handed people are well accepted for that trait, and we don't attempt to alter it. There's no difference between that biological inclination and a same-sex inclination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the end, though, the key thing for me was I came to appreciate that this opposition to marriage equality was in fact the last hook that people who wanted to say, 'You are different; I can legitimately treat you differently and discriminate against you,' were clinging to. This was the last hook left that allowed them to do that and enabled them to maintain their discriminatory mindset. It became clear to me that it was important to move on in order to eliminate this last frontier, to ensure that nobody could be given a basis for treating someone differently and discriminating against them on the basis of their sexuality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say I was deeply moved by and deeply proud of Eden-Monaro in this process. Eden-Monaro responded magnificently. Over 80 per cent of people filled in the survey, and 65 per cent of them voted yes for marriage equality—65 per cent of a rural and regional community, the very people that everyone told me back in 2012 would slaughter me if I voted for this proposition. I'm proud of them, because they showed intelligence to sift through the noise on either side of this debate to get to an intelligent and compassionate outcome. At the end of the day I think they understand what it is like in small country towns, how alienated and frustrated people who are in a minority such as this feel and that it has often led to suicides in rural and regional towns. That is a great tragedy, and we've had many of those in my region. That understanding is also reflected in this result, and I'm so intensely proud of them. I'm proud to be here to give voice to that 65 per cent yes vote and that 80 per cent response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also understand, though, that there are still those who voted no and that they expect to have their concerns addressed. There will be space for that. I don't support the amendments to this legislation that are being proposed. This is a simple attempt to put the Marriage Act basically back to where it was before John Howard interfered with it. A lot of the issues I've heard raised are issues that aren't even in the federal jurisdiction. What happens in schools is a matter for the states. As has been said, which I wholeheartedly endorse, we shouldn't be replacing one form of discrimination with another, and we should take great care in what we do in this space. The religious safeguards that are in the bill should reassure those who voted no.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I intend to continue to reach out to those people, to have ongoing discussions, as I have over the many years that I've been advocating on this issue. I would hope that this result reflects some of that work. I would ring and meet face to face with anybody who raised with me their intention to vote no or their uncertainty. I had countless personal conversations all the way through this in all of the mobile offices. I made it very clear to people where I stood because I believed they had the right to know where their representative stood, so that they had the chance to vote on that basis if they so chose. Those conversations were very rewarding. I took them on the personal journey I'd been through. I think, at the end of the day, that had some impact, along with my advocacy in our public media. I'm pleased with and proud of that result, and I'm proud to represent a region that can be so intelligent and compassionate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank young Eddie Blewett, whom the deputy leader mentioned, and his mothers, Claire and Neroli. Eddie and his family have been so brave, forthright and articulate in fighting this battle. They have made Tathra and Eden-Monaro proud in their behaviour and their representation of what a loving family unit can be in this context. I also say thank you to David Wilson and Kyle Moser, who operate the post office in Cobargo, who bravely put a rainbow flag up above the post office and were told by Australia Post to take it down. We had a wonderfully civil and respectful debate through the whole process of the survey, notwithstanding the pressure that it put on people of these sexualities and people struggling to come to grips with their sexuality at a young age, feeling very vulnerable. A group came to see me who were clients of headspace in Queanbeyan, begging for us not to go ahead with this survey—but, when it happened, the process in our region worked well.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, after the results came through, some vandal or group of vandals graffitied the post office of David Wilson and Kyle Moser in Cobargo. It came as quite a shock to them. It was vile, homophobic graffiti, not only on the post office but on other parts of town. The community responded magnificently. People rallied behind Kyle and David. As soon as it was known in the morning, they were out there with buckets, suds and soap, cleaning off that vile graffiti. I was pleased to be able to phone them and to go down and meet with them personally as well to reassure them about the support of our community. Those people should realise they say more about themselves than they do about people of same-sex relationships. They're the ones who broke the law and who threaten to divide our community. They should be ashamed of themselves. I would urge them to come forward and apologise for that; otherwise, they will have to live with that act for the rest of their lives. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, there is one message that I think this whole process should really educate us to absorb. It's really well summed up for me by the words of Audre Lorde, a black lesbian mother, cancer survivor and poet, who said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is not our differences that divide us. It is our inability to recognize, accept, and celebrate those differences.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PASIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">23:40</span>):  Mr Deputy Speaker, it will come as no surprise to you that my view of marriage is a traditional one. In fact, that's a view shared by nearly five million Australians. My view is informed by my faith. Having said that, I indicated early in this debate that I would respect the outcome of the national vote, and I will. As important as social change is, the method of achieving that change, in my view, is much more important. That's why I argued for a plebiscite to resolve this issue, this issue that was troubling our national conscience. I wanted to see 24 million Australians making this decision, not 226 politicians. I congratulate former Prime Minister Abbott for having the courage to adopt this policy position. I equally congratulate the current Prime Minister for having the courage to stick with that policy position and take that policy position to the 2016 federal election. While I'm congratulating people, I think it remiss to not congratulate Minister Cormann and Minister Dutton, who I think we can all accept were the architects of what ultimately became a mechanism whereby close to 80 per cent of Australians cast their vote. They did that against a background whereby those opposite and members of the commentariat said the High Court would strike down this mechanism. Well, the High Court didn't strike down that mechanism, and I'm grateful for that. As I said, what that did was facilitate this decision being made by those eligible Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sitting in my room and preparing to speak tonight, I have tried to leave the partisanship to one side, but I really do need to point out a couple of things. The first is that those opposite, who seem to be so celebrating this victory of democracy, had six years, between 2007 and 2013, and they couldn't bring themselves to get this job done. Equally, those opposite fought tooth and nail against the process which ultimately has delivered this change. They fought tooth and nail despite this process having obtained a mandate at the federal election of 2016. Enough of the partisanship. As I have said, I made it clear, just like I made it clear to my preselectors in early 2013, that I supported the traditional definition of marriage. I made it clear to the electorate of Barker in 2013 that I did. I confirmed that position in 2016 in the lead-up to the election of that year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also made it clear, as I've said previously, that I would respect the outcome of the national vote. The majority of Australians cast their vote in favour of same-sex marriage; we know that. Accordingly, same-sex marriage must now be recognised. Indeed, same-sex marriage will be recognised, and I will vote according to my commitment. Barker, whilst recording South Australia's lowest vote in favour of same-sex marriage, still returned a majority. Indeed, 52.3 per cent of residents in Barker voted in favour of change. Prior to this debate, I was concerned about what we may have seen during this national conversation. I must say I was pleased that the national debate, whilst robust, was conducted largely without rancour. There were occasions which disappointed me and I think offended our national consciousness. Those came from both sides of the debate, but what particularly sticks in my mind is the young girl whose employment was terminated as a result of her expression of her free speech and also a placard which was, effectively, calling on people to burn churches. Both of those things deeply disappointed me, but I'm pleased to say that they were very much on the fringes. As I've said, the debate was largely conducted without rancour—and I think that was fair enough—because, after all, I've long maintained that this was an issue on which decent people could differ. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My hope is that this national exercise, one which saw nearly eight of every 10 eligible Australians express a view, will operate as a unifying moment for our nation. Indeed, my hope is that parliament will see fit to legislate for same-sex marriage in a way that strengthens freedoms and protects freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom of parental choice. It should be noted at this point that contemporaneous polling during the course of the postal ballot made it clear that the overwhelming majority of Australians supported the protection of these important freedoms. After all, no Australian, in my view, should be discriminated against because of their conscientiously-held view of marriage. It would be, of course, a crying shame to see new forms of intolerance replacing old ones. Let's hope that those in this debate—whom I must congratulate on their victory—who have won the right to celebrate their relationships, if they wish, as married couples, respect that not all Australians share their view on this question of marriage. I truly hope that, if we fail to protect these important freedoms, we will not see the litigious behaviours that we have seen in other jurisdictions—but only time will tell.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I first spoke in this place, I indicated to the chamber that I believed in the conservation of important institutions. In my view, the most fundamental of all institutions is the family unit. If through this exercise we can deliver stronger families across this nation then we will have achieved a good thing. In line with my commitment, I will vote in favour of this bill, and I will do so in a way that I hope improves on the freedoms that we enjoy today, irrespective of the fate of those amendments. As I've made clear, I'll vote in favour of the bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">23:50</span>):  The core work of government and our society—our priority—should be assisting the poor, the marginalised and the oppressed. We need to be helping people find work to look after their families, providing good education and health care, growing our economy in a sustainable way, helping those with mental illness or drug addiction and ridding our society of the scourge of domestic violence. Removing discrimination from our law is part of this. I believe this is what the majority of Australians are about as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past months we have heard a great deal from the religious Right, the extreme Right and the conservative Right. We have also heard a lot from the extreme Left, the secular Left and the ideological Left—too much of it negative and too often abusive. As a Catholic MP who tries to get to church each Sunday I find myself in an interesting place during this same-sex marriage debate. Indeed, many have found it difficult to come to grips with my profession of faith and my support of marriage equality. Clearly, my Catholic faith and upbringing have a strong influence on the way I see the world—what I see as important and how our society should operate. I have no doubt that this has informed my support for and my membership of the Labor Party. However, it does not dictate to me everything that I do as an MP. And nor should it, because I have a responsibility as a parliamentarian to everyone in Burt, the electorate I represent, which voted 57 per cent in favour of same-sex marriage, as well as the nation as a whole, which voted 61 per cent in favour of same-sex marriage. I also have a responsibility to those who voted no or who didn't respond at all. As the great Catholic philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas posited, our law is framed for the multitude. Our laws do not forbid things because of one group's values or beliefs, but, chiefly, they should forbid things that are injurious to others. This law will not cause injury to anyone or to our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the present debate, other MPs have been keen to point out what they call the historical nature of the concept of marriage, observing that they oppose same-sex marriage because it cuts across their view of the Christian form of marriage as the only true form of marriage, having existed in this way through the ages and across cultures. Firstly, this is factually inaccurate. Secondly, as six of the seven High Court judges said when deciding on the validity of the ACT's attempt to allow for same-sex marriage in territory law:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The status of marriage, the social institution which that status reflects, and the rights and obligations which attach to that status never have been, and are not now, immutable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that marriage exists as a construct of our legal system is now a very old one, as can be seen from the change made to the law in the UK and in Australia in the 1850s, where instead of marriage being for life it became something entered into for life but from which one could become divorced. As you would imagine, many people opposed this change then, but it has always been seen as a legal, not a sacramental, one. Nor has it in any way changed what is preached in churches or in religious schools. Indeed, divorces are not even recognised in the Catholic Church, where the sacrament of marriage can be ended only by annulment through the church.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In earlier times there were debates about whether African Americans should be allowed to marry white Americans, whether Aboriginals should be allowed to marry white Australians and whether—that mother of all social faux pas—a Protestant should be allowed to marry a Catholic. Opposition to such marriages is now seen as bigoted, racist and discriminatory, yet at the time these were strongly held views with force of law, defended in many cases on the basis of what was then seen as God's order of nature. The core element of religious freedom is that the state does not prescribe any one religious view as the law, thereby imposing it upon the adherents of another religion. This is reflected in our separation of church and state. That is not to say that the parliament should not make laws that are consistent—or inconsistent—with any particular religious view but, rather, that laws should not be made on religious grounds. I should not as an MP, even as a Catholic one, seek to impose the view of my religion on the whole nation, nor should the view of any other religion or religions be imposed on others. Alas, this is what I think some MPs and some in the 'no' campaign have sought to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be clear, I take no issue with churches advocating their view on marriage or with anyone raising their concerns about what they see as the possible effects on society if we change the nature of marriage in our law. That is all part of our democratic right and freedom of political expression. Indeed, it should be encouraged. I do, however, take issue with those that have muddied the water by denying or misconstruing our existing religious freedom protections or raising other unrelated matters and conflating them with the matter at hand. The definition of marriage in our civil law is for the purposes of civil marriage, not curriculum content in schools and not what may be said in religious education or churches. Australian law is different to and operates differently to that of other nations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, as introduced by Senator Dean Smith—and I congratulate him on his hard work in this regard—strikes an acceptable compromise in achieving marriage equality and protecting religious freedoms. This balance is based on the unanimous recommendations of a Senate committee which reviewed the government's previously proposed legislation. That committee was made up of representatives across political parties and consulted with the community. The thing is that, while not many human rights are expressly protected in Australia, these ones are. Our Constitution prohibits laws that prohibit the free exercise of religion or that establish a religion, and there are specific exemptions from antidiscrimination laws to ensure that churches can preach their views and run their schools in accordance with their teachings. These protections are very important to me too, and they should remain. Critically, nothing in this legislation removes such protections. Indeed, for some, such protections are enhanced by this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill does not propose any additional carve-outs to our discrimination legislation, and I could not support such measures. Changing our laws to allow bakers, florists and others to refuse service to LGBTIQ people for same-sex weddings would be an apartheid-like policy. It would be legalised segregation and a return to the day of shop windows hanging signs stating, 'No Jews,' or, 'No Irish.' Such an approach is, in my view, completely morally reprehensible. I would have thought that what we should have learnt from Australia's sectarian past would have taught those advocating such an approach better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> I do, though, welcome the government's decision to encourage a broader consultative process regarding religious freedom protections into the next year. The outcome of this should be given full consideration by this parliament. It also means that it is not appropriate to countenance amendments to this bill to attempt to retrofit and augment such rights in a rushed and improper fashion. In a similar vein, I say to my colleagues in the Western Australian state parliament that any consideration of changes to state law to remove religious freedom protections from religious schools should not proceed and, in any event, should await the outcomes of the federal government's review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said when I started, the move for marriage equality is about removing discrimination and injustice from our law. While many see marriage equality as a fringe issue that doesn't affect them, what is often overlooked is that taking this approach is not how we as a society make ourselves better or successfully look after each other. The words of Pastor Niemoller are apt in this regard:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The meaning of these words sums up the solemn responsibility that we who sit here hold. As parliamentarians in a representative democracy, it is not our role to blindly reflect only the majority of views of our electorate or to speak only to issues that affect or are in the interests of the majority in our electorates. It is our role to always act in the best interests of our whole nation and to protect minorities against the tyranny of the majority.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As such, the abrogation of the role of parliament facilitated by the Turnbull government through the recent survey must not be repeated. It was unnecessary and a huge waste of money. It led to vitriol, abuse and division—division across our community but also, most worryingly, division within families. To LGBTIQ Australians and your families, that it came to having to go through this process, I say sorry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In equal part, I was happy to see that the response from the survey was a strong majority view to extend equal rights to a minority in our community—a minority that should no longer have to feel that way. While the missing mainstream were often silent in the debate, they were not missing in the result. Whether they are atheist or agnostic centrists, mainstream Christians or adherents of other faiths, there are many Australians going about their daily lives believing in a god but being more focused on a daily basis on having to make ends meet and supporting their families. When their minds do turn to same-sex marriage, their primary concern has been that Australia remains the country of a fair go. I think that is something that we can all believe in. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you distil it down, to love your god and to love your neighbour, so far as your neighbour is concerned, is about a fair go—not just a fair go for those needing work, those wanting a proper education, those wanting proper health care, victims of domestic violence, those with disabilities or anyone needing a leg up but a fair go for my great mates Drew and Liam, who had to hold their wedding in the British consulate in March last year. While we celebrated the occasion in suitable and expected style—one would expect no less from this couple—the truth still hurt us, let alone the imaginable pain it caused to them, that, once they stepped out of that consulate in Sydney, Australian law did not recognise their marriage. Our law delegitimised their relationship, but anyone who knows them knows the depth and nature of their relationship and their love for one another. There is nothing illegitimate about that. It's a fair go for Stephen and Dennis, who, despite being the first gay couple in Australia to marry—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  On Tuesday 21 November the life of Rotarian and family lawyer Anne Egan OAM was celebrated at a requiem mass at Sacred Heart Church, Murwillumbah. Anne, the seventh of nine children, was born and educated in Sydney. After school she obtained a Commonwealth scholarship and commenced a combined degree of arts/law at Sydney University, majoring in government. It was at university that she met her husband, Jeff, and the two moved to Murwillumbah in 1979 to start a family law practice. Anne was passionate about helping others, which was the driving force of her family law career. She sought fairness for everyone in all of her dealings. In her 62 years she was involved in a lifetime of community activities: board member of the Murwillumbah District Hospital, board member of the Tweed Valley Women's Service, an honorary solicitor for so many organisations and a founding leader of the Sacred Heart Parish Family Group.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anne was invited to become a charter member of the Rotary Club of Mt Warning AM in May 2000. Over the years, she held numerous positions at club and district level, including as assistant governor for three years and then as district governor in 2015 to 2016 for District 9640. As district governor she was known for her warmth, her fun, and sometimes wearing a tiara and feather boa. Anne had a wonderful, cheeky spirit but, above all, she had a strong sense of social justice. She was not afraid to stand up for what she believed in. Her service was recognised on 26 October this year with an Order of Australia Medal, presented by the Acting Governor-General, His Excellency David Hurley. Her OAM was for service for the community of the Tweed region. Above all, Anne always had time for her precious family: her husband, Jeff; children, Kate, Tim and Ben; their partners and her two wonderful grandchildren. Rotary's code of ethics is a four-way test:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Long before Anne joined Rotary and knew of the Four-Way Test, she already lived it in her work, her faith and her daily life. Rotary International has a theme each year, and the theme for Anne's year as district governor was Be a Gift to the World. Anne was indeed a gift to the world, and she will be so dearly missed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Revenue and Financial Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  I rise to raise Victorian state Labor's disappointing neglect of necessary level crossing removals throughout the electorate of Higgins. This is a very serious concern to residents in my community, who are sick and tired of congestion on our roads. In 2012 I began advocating for the removal of eight level crossings across Higgins on both the Glen Waverley and Dandenong-Pakenham lines. These level crossings inhibit the capacity of our railways, divide our community and encroach on time that could be spent with family and friends or otherwise committed to work. We can now see how the successful removal of the Burke Road level crossing, which was fully funded by the previous Victorian coalition government, has reduced congestion and improved amenity for residents of Malvern and Glen Iris and for commuters accessing the Monash Freeway.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that other level crossings on the Glen Waverley line need to be removed now. The RACV 2016 Redspot Survey continues to rank the Toorak Road level crossing among Victoria's top 10 worst congestion spots. The Level Crossing Removal Authority's own website notes, on the Toorak Road level crossing:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The boom gates disrupt the flow of traffic for the 39,000 vehicles that drive through the level crossing each day and can be down for up to 45 minutes in the morning peak. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This not only causes congestion locally but also impedes traffic flow, slowing and delaying vehicles continuing towards the CBD, yet the state government has no firm plans to remove crossings on the Glen Waverley line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've previously written to the state Labor Minister for Public Transport, Jacinta Allan, strongly conveying my view that level crossings in my electorate need to be removed now. They need to be removed with rail-under-road solutions, not via the elevated and unsightly sky rail which, following the Andrews government's discontinuation of the previous Victorian coalition government's level crossing removal plan, was forced on the communities of Carnegie and Murrumbeena without consultation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on Labor Premier Daniel Andrews to direct the $70 million in interest earned from the Commonwealth's $1.5 billion prepayment for the East West Link towards removing level crossings in Higgins. Instead of more delays, our community needs action now. We need to improve congestion on our roads. We need to give families more time to do what they do best, which is spending time with one another. I will continue to fight for the removal of level crossings across Higgins to ensure that our roads are safer and less congested.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMT" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms VAMVAKINOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  I rise today to congratulate the Greek Australian newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;">Neos Kosmos</span>, which this year celebrated its 60th anniversary. The importance of <span style="font-style:italic;">Neos Kosmos</span> was evident throughout the many pages of its special anniversary edition, which carried stories and tributes to members of the Greek Australian community, past and present; and images from its vast collection of photographic archives, documenting the challenging times faced by the Greek Australian community as it made its way through the integration process here in Australia over the last 60 years, but also its success and prosperity here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was February 1957 when the first <span style="font-style:italic;">Neos Kosmos</span> went to print from a tiny office in Niagara Lane in Melbourne's CBD. The four-page edition was filled with news from Greece and reports from Greeks living in Melbourne. Little did the team and the founding editor, Takis Gogos, know—as history now attests—that on that day they were to print the first edition of one of Australia's most influential ethnic media sources. I can tell you that it's the most thoroughly read and sought-after ethnic media here in Parliament House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's incredibly fitting that the name <span style="font-style:italic;">Neos Kosmos </span>translates to 'new world'. The newspaper was a by-product of its time, when thousands of Greeks from postwar Europe began migrating to Australia—a new world—and they were to be known as 'new Australians'. As the migrants transitioned to their new world and new life in Australia, <span style="font-style:italic;">Neos Kosmos</span> was there with them throughout their journey. True to the principles of access and equity that underpin our multicultural policy, <span style="font-style:italic;">Neos Kosmos</span> upheld with excellence the role of informing, ensuring no-one was excluded or disadvantaged because of any language barriers. It educated and challenged while it not only kept Greek Australians connected to their language and culture but also gave them access to the broader Australian community, especially in the crucial area of settlement services and government agencies, so critical in those early years of migrant settlement and integration. In helping to foster a community, <span style="font-style:italic;">Neos Kosmos</span> became that community's voice. It became more than a newspaper. It became, and still is, an institution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our own home, like thousands of other homes across the country, <span style="font-style:italic;">Neos Kosmos</span> was a household staple. In many ways, for me personally, <span style="font-style:italic;">Neos Kosmos</span> was my initial introduction into politics both at a local Greek community level and at a domestic and global level. It's not that I didn't read the mainstream dailies; I did. It's just that <span style="font-style:italic;">Neos Kosmos</span> provided a nuanced news service that certainly helped me understand and be informed about the issues confronting the Greek Australian community and the broader migrant community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From dramatic moments in Australian political history, such as the Dismissal in 1975, to its reporting and critiquing of the events surrounding the military junta in Greece in 1967, the ebullition of its fall and the return of democracy in 1974, <span style="font-style:italic;">Neos Kosmos</span> has been a serious player in political reporting. I congratulate all the team at <span style="font-style:italic;">Neos Kosmos</span> and wish them every success for another 60 years of service to the Greek Australian community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  Last Thursday, like so many other days since I became the member for Dunkley, I spent the morning touring a selection of small businesses. This time, I focused on a number of unique small businesses in Dunkley who contribute to our local economy. In particular, I want to give a shout-out to Mark at Sew Fix Sewing Machine Repairs, who works out of the industrial complex at Seaford. Mark's business started out in his shed, repairing sewing machines of all types and ages. I was intrigued to see all the different models lined up in his workshop, from Singer sewing machines of my grandparents' era right through to modern machines with LCD screens and digital settings. Mark imports sewing machines for local customers, puts them together and sets them up, ready to be used the minute they are taken out the door or shipped interstate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few doors down, I spent some time speaking to Dave of David Gumbrell Saddles, a master saddler who both makes and repairs racehorse saddles. Dave explained to me the complexities of importing and exporting cowhides used in saddles and expressed some concern that a lot of Australian hides tend to be sent overseas as a priority, rather than being available for Australian work. It was a privilege to see Dave's business at work and I am grateful that he took the time to walk me through how his business works and to convey his concerns as a local small business owner. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also visited The Comic Place, in Frankston, a new comic-book store that places a particular emphasis on Australian content on a wide variety of subject matters. I was delighted to see that the owner, Jim, makes his own comic—<span style="font-style:italic;">Cyberstone</span>—and it was on the shelves with other franchises, such as Marvel's X-Men and so forth. I purchased for my office a copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Anzac Legend</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;">A Graphic History</span>, in comic form, by Melbourne author and illustrator Dave Dye.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we make our way through December, particularly leading up to Christmas, I encourage everyone to 'shop local' at our small businesses and to support our local economy in Dunkley. I'm so proud that these and the 16,000-odd other hardworking small businesses in Dunkley continue to add to our local economy, and to our identity in Dunkley and across Australia. This Christmas, shop small, shop local—shop in Dunkley.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  The Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network's report on the rollout of the NBN only confirmed Canberra's worst fears—that this government's rollout is failing them. It's causing a digital divide within the suburbs of my community right across the electorate of Canberra, and it will leave many people in my community behind and many others no better off. The reason for this is that it's a rollout of a second-grade network. Since launching the Send Me Your Speeds campaign 18 months ago, I've shared the experiences of hundreds of Canberrans who are struggling to run businesses, who are struggling to study and who are struggling to communicate. They're struggling because they've got download and upload speeds of less than one megabit per second—we're talking one megabit per second within five kays of this Parliament House, 10 kays of this Parliament House, 20 kays of this Parliament House. This is in the nation's capital. This is in 2017.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are speeds that they're currently getting on ADSL using the copper network. This is the same network that this government expects the NBN to use in its deployment of fibre to the node. Instead of rolling out a network that would advance Australia's standing in the international rankings when it comes to broadband, this government is attached to a rollout that is pushing us backwards. It's definitely not the network you would expect for the 21st century and beyond. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Canberra is fast becoming one of Australia's great innovation hubs and knowledge economies. We are seeing growth in the defence and space industries—there's been significant investment in space, most recently—and an increasing number of start-ups in renewables and manufacturing. Along with the growth of these industries, Canberra is home to thousands of small businesses and microbusinesses, most of which operate from home. The main thing holding back many of these businesses is internet speed. Many businesses will face an additional burden when trying to compete domestically and on the international stage without communications infrastructure that will serve them both now and into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want these businesses to be able to thrive. I want people to be able to work from home. I don't want them to have to go off to hire office space and commute there just because the internet speed is so lousy. It shouldn't be so hard. Why is this government so determined to hold back businesses here in Canberra? Internet speed doesn't only make a difference to businesses; it's a key enabler for students, grandparents and families. I have heard from so many students and parents concerned about their current speeds. It is holding them back from educational opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The joint committee's report determined what so many of us already knew—that fibre to the node will quickly become an outdated technology. I'm calling on the government to adopt the recommendations from the report and roll out fibre to the curb as a minimum.</span>

Leo's design will feature on the Goldstein Christmas card this year, circulated throughout the homes of the entire electorate. One of the things that we loved about Leo's design particularly was that it had a sense of movement and energy around a Christmas tree and a home and it also had reindeer and Santa. I know you are excited, Mr Deputy Speaker Howarth—I will make sure you get one for Christmas! This decision wasn't just made by me, it was also made with the assistance of Michelle Laragy from the Beaumaris Art Group, who kindly volunteered to assist in the judging of the competition.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leo's design is not the only one on the Christmas card. Isobel, the runner-up from St Leonard's College, has her artwork on the back of it. It was a pleasure to host Leo, Isobel, their families and all the finalists for a morning tea on 24 November to recognise all the different finalists, including, from Caulfield South Primary School, Rosa of grade 2, Hayley from grade 3, Mischy from grade 3, Chloe from grade 2, Kayla from grade 2 and Aliya from grade 4. They also included, from Kostka Hall, Leo—who I have already mentioned—from grade 2, Harrison from grade 3, Ambrose from grade 1, Gianluca from grade 3, Emilio from grade 2, Harvey from grade 2 and Jonathan from grade 6. There were also from St Finbar's Primary School in Brighton Lily from grade 6, Kimberley from grade 6, Helena from grade 4, Juliet from grade 3 and Sophia from grade 4. I also say congratulations to the other finalists such as Grace from grade 2, Sophia from grade 1, Anouk from grade 5, Sophie from grade 5, Indie from grade 2, Sophia from grade 3, Juliet from grade 3 and Alessia from grade 2 from St Joan of Arc Catholic Primary School, which is also in Brighton. There were also a number of other students from St Leonard's College, one of the major schools that contributed to the competition, including Isobel from prep, Annika from grade 4, Tessa from grade 4, Oliver from grade 3, Isabella from grade 1, Ella from prep, Genevieve from grade 2, Luella from grade 4, Imogen from grade 2, Chunmin from grade 4, James from grade 4, Mitchell from grade 2, Indiana from grade 4— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  On 22 November our community celebrated the 30th anniversary of Australia's only women's-only drug and alcohol residential detox program at Jarrah House. In 1984 a conference was held in Sydney where strategies for improving services for women with drug and alcohol dependence and problems were discussed. Throughout that conference it became apparent that there was a lack of support and accommodation for women going through such difficulties and, as a result, the conference gave resounding support to the establishment of a specialist women's-only detoxification unit which also provided childcare services. Despite overcoming initial reluctance from governments to fund a women's-only program, three years later, in 1987, the Women's Alcohol and Drug Advisory Centre was formed and received funding to open Jarrah House on 24 July as part of a national campaign against drug abuse. Initially it was located in the inner west, but it soon moved to Prince Henry Hospital at Little Bay in the community I represent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With a name that's derived from the Aboriginal term meaning 'tall and straight' and located at Little Bay, Jarrah House is built on the belief that women have the right to choose the way in which they make positive changes in their lives. Other aims and objectives of Jarrah House include encouraging women to seek intervention for alcohol and other drug dependence problems; providing a 24-hour service to meet detoxification needs of women and their children in a safe environment; and providing accurate legal, health and welfare information to both resident and non-resident women. It's still the only women's-only detox unit with a childcare centre in this country. Jarrah House operates 24 beds. Thirteen are government funded and the rest come from small donations and rents from clients. It operates a 10-week program with three parts: detox and stabilise for four weeks, rehab and skills for six weeks, and after care post-treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The staff of Jarrah House include a registered nurse, a doctor, alcohol counsellors, social workers, childcare workers and a yoga instructor. It is nothing short of a miracle that the workers perform in saving the lives of countless women and children each year. The wonderful workers of Jarrah House do an amazing job day in, day out. They're an absolute godsend to our community and the many people who struggle with substance abuse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the celebration that we held recently, we heard a number of testimonials from women who've been through the program with their children, and it was wonderful to see those children now in their teenage years and the women back on their feet in stable relationships, earning an income and contributing to our society. All of them said they wouldn't have been able to get through that difficult period in their lives without the support of Jarrah House. I thank and pay tribute to Jarrah House and its amazing team for their 30 years of service.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  I rise today to report to the Chamber on the recent Pacific Women's Parliamentary Partnerships Forum in the Solomon Islands. I was privileged to be invited by the Hon. Julie Bishop to lead the Australian delegation to the forum during the last week of September. This forum was attended by Australian parliaments from federal, state and territory levels, as well as representatives from 13 Pacific nations. The Australian federal delegation included the Chief Government Whip, the member for Forrest, Nola Marino; the member for Gilmore, Ann Sudmalis; Senator Claire Moore; and Senator Anne Urquhart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The PWPP is funded by the Australian government and supports the professional and skills development of Pacific women parliamentarians and staff. It develops engagement between women in the Pacific region and their parliaments and supports research into gender equality. This week-long forum focused on many issues, including women's leadership, women's economic empowerment, and ending violence against women. Importantly, as neighbours do, we also discussed the future support that Australia can offer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an honour to join with such amazing Pacific women, who have achieved so much despite their unique challenges. Due to historical and ongoing social, cultural and economic barriers, there is still a noticeable imbalance in the representation of women in the upper echelons of Pacific legislatures and other decision-making bodies. We can ill afford for these small nations to fall behind, and it is therefore vital that, as a progressive country, we encourage and empower women to ensure their contribution benefits their countries. As at August 2017, the percentage of women elected in Pacific parliaments sits at approximately seven per cent. Women have never comprised more than 10 per cent of the membership of Pacific national parliaments in forum island countries since independence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that, through partnerships like the Pacific Women's Parliamentary Partnerships program, we will see more female participation as elected representatives. These forums facilitate face-to-face interaction and understanding of issues and ways to instigate change. We may not see instant results in the short term, but over a longer period these nations will benefit from discussions and support facilitated through these forums. As my good friend and colleague the member for Forrest says, 'To empower a woman is to empower a family,' and to empower a woman is to empower a whole community. That is so very true. However, I believe that to elect a woman to any of the parliaments in our neighbouring countries is to empower a nation. Increasing the participation and inclusion of women in decision-making roles will have profound benefits for all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A big thank you to all involved in this delegation, including the staff from DFAT who ensured Australia's involvement in this event was a success. I seek leave to table the Australian delegation's report.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  Thank you very much. I first want to acknowledge that I'm joined in the chamber here today by a visitor from my electorate, Isabella Thomas, who is here with the Country to Canberra delegation. She's from Daylesford Secondary College, and I want to welcome her here in the Chamber today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013, the then Labor government introduced the National Disability Insurance Scheme. This policy was one of the greatest social policy reforms since Medicare and one of which Labor is justifiably very proud. The NDIS is a once-in-a-generation reform focused on delivering better services and support to ensure that people with disabilities are able to lead strong and independent lives. It is a policy that, when fully rolled out, will reach the lives of over 475,000 people with disabilities, transforming the lives of them, their families and those that care for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians with disability have waited their whole lives for the NDIS, and it is up to all of us in this place to work continually to ensure that it has every success. This is a role that we must undertake with some urgency. In my electorate of Ballarat I have heard too many stories of individuals not being able to access the support they need or not being able to get into the scheme at the time they need to. This is particularly a problem for those with complex needs, as they struggle to work through the NDIS system to access support suited to their unique situation. Others have for too long been stranded in limbo, unsure if or when they will be able to access these services. I'm very aware of the negative experiences that many within my electorate of Ballarat have had with the NDIS and I'm also very aware of some of the reasons why.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, as was identified by the Productivity Commission, there are not enough staff within the NDIA and not enough providers of the services that people with disabilities need. Too often I have heard of people not being able to access the service they deserve and need simply because not enough capacity has been put into the system. One of the main reasons for this lack of support and capacity, frankly, is that this government has imposed a cap on the number of staff employed by the NDIA. This cap, in operation for a number of years, has severely restricted the ability of people with a disability to get into the scheme and access the services that they need. At the same time, the capacity of the market to meet the changing needs created by the NDIS has to be called into question. It is now the government's role to step in with a strategy to address these flaws. Another flaw with the NDIS has been its IT problems, which are well documented throughout the media.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many families in my community have waited their whole lives for the NDIS. They are desperately in need of the services. Its implementation is not going the way it should. People cannot afford to wait any longer. I urge the government to do everything it can to improve the rollout of the NDIS, not only in Ballarat but across the country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  As Christmas and the festive season are fast approaching, can I take this opportunity to acknowledge, thank and encourage the many volunteers and organisations in my electorate who do so much for the wellbeing of others, including Doncare, the Returned &amp; Services League clubs, the Lions and Rotary clubs, the local parish churches, the synagogue, the mosque, the senior citizens club, the Manningham Interfaith Network, the various aged-care and health services, and of course all the services associated with the Manningham and Maroondah councils.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I also encourage residents to embrace the festive cheer and to help families doing it tough in Manningham and Maroondah at this time of the year. Hundreds of individuals and families give to children less fortunate by donating to Doncare's wishing trees each year. Donated gifts then form part of Doncare's pop-up Christmas shop and give families experiencing hardship the opportunity to choose toys for their children at Christmas. This year Doncare's wishing trees are located at Bulleen Plaza, Warrandyte Library, the North Blackburn Shopping Centre, Aquarena, Manningham City Council and the Doncaster Library at MC Square. Simply take a tag from the tree and donate a new toy for a child or a gift card for a teenager.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 36th annual Manningham carols by candlelight will be held on 15 December at 6 pm at Ruffey Lake Park in Doncaster. To capture the magic of Christmas, the Manningham carols by candlelight will conclude with the ever popular spectacular fireworks display. There will be a number of food stalls on the night, including that of the Rotary Club of Manningham, which will be putting on a sausage sizzle for a gold coin donation to a good cause.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also encourage residents to donate to a good cause by obtaining a Lions Christmas cake from the Donvale Lions Club. Proceeds from this project are donated to the local community for some great causes, including blindness prevention and vision improvement projects, medical research, the Lions Children's Mobility Foundation, the eye health program, hearing dogs, disaster relief, and aged care, drug awareness and youth programs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of volunteers, I pay tribute to Erik Rubens, a stalwart of the local Manningham community, who passed away suddenly over the weekend. Erik migrated from the Netherlands in 1983, finally settling in Melbourne. He had a strong background in international trade, marketing and wine exports. He was active in the small business network as well as an organising committee member for the Manningham Business Excellence Awards. He has been mentoring small business owners and operators for years, in addition to owning the Travel Store in James Street, Templestowe. He had been a very active member of the Rotary Club of Templestowe since 2013 and held a number of positions over the years. I extend my condolences to Janene and his two daughters, Helena and Sarah.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  I want to speak out in favour of the hundreds of thousands of workers who are struggling to make ends meet as we go into the Christmas period. I particularly want to give a shout-out to workers who rely on penalty rates, and make some particularly harsh comments about members who have come to this place and failed to represent their constituents. I want to talk about the member for Dawson, who's spoken a very big game on the issue of penalty rates but, when given the opportunity to speak up and vote in favour of the 14,000 workers impacted by penalty rates in his electorate, he has left them stranded. Over 7,900 retail workers and around 6,000 food and accommodation workers have been sold out by their MP. We have all been reading with interest the comments in the newspapers and the backgrounding that has been going on for journalists in this place over the last fortnight: 'I will cross the floor, I will step down and resign from the coalition if things don't go my way.' But, when given the opportunity to stand up for people in his electorate and have the courage of his convictions, he went missing. The member for Dawson is rightly condemned by everybody in this place for talking one way and walking the other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this is not the first time the member for Dawson has done this. In fact, he has a history of talking one way and voting the other. We all remember last year when he introduced a private member's bill to protect the Australian flag. This is the very same man who is voting in favour of legislation in the House to have the Australian flag removed from Australian ships so that Australian workers can be replaced by foreign workers to man those ships. This man has absolutely no credibility when it comes to sticking up for the people of regional Queensland. He talks a very big game when he's up there in his electorate, but he acts like a complete lamb when it comes to standing up for the people of his electorate here in parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can expect over the next few weeks the member for Dawson to be looking for some distraction from the embarrassment that he has suffered over the last week, selling out his constituency when it comes to penalty rates, and selling them out on so many other issues. We know that the member for Dawson has had things to say about religions that he doesn't like. We have heard him speak out over the last month about the importance of freedom of religion and religious protections when it comes to the same-sex marriage bill. But the very same MP has stood in the House and made some pretty harsh criticisms of people who practise faiths and religions that he does not like. The people of regional Queensland want somebody to stand up and speak out for them, but they want somebody to come here to parliament and vote in exactly the same way.</span>

Over the last few weeks I've had the pleasure of contacting a number of organisations in my electorate of McPherson to let them know that they have been successful in their application for funding under that program. There are, of course, many organisations on the southern Gold Coast that make a difference, but I would like to acknowledge the following who received well-deserved Stronger Communities Fund grants: the Burleigh Heads Mowbray Park Surf Life Saving Club for a new flagpole; the Currumbin Beach Vikings Surf Life Saving Club to renovate their clubhouse; Coolangatta Country Women's Association for renovations and audiovisual equipment; the Palm Beach Cricket Club for new cricket nets; the Palm Beach-Currumbin AFL club to refurbish change rooms; the Lab to provide new technology for young people diagnosed with high-functioning autism; the Benevolent Society for a new support centre for young people and their families; the Sanctuary women and children's refuge to upgrade accessibility and security; Burleigh Heads Rotary Club to provide no-cost mobility scooters for those most in need; the Twin City Baseball Club for portable fencing; Fight 4 Youth to buy a new van; and Mudgeeraba Scouts to revitalise their den. I'm pleased to say that there are a couple more to be announced in the coming week. My sincere thanks go to my Stronger Communities committee members: Jeff Davis, John Forrester, Hilary Jacobs and Catherine Pevy-Trewartha. Thank you so much.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I also had the pleasure of announcing on behalf of the government $1.325 million in funding for Arcadia College in my electorate through the Capital Grants Program. Arcadia College takes a different approach to learning, and it's certainly a very inclusive environment. Students learn in a team with their own team leader in their own studio. There are currently about 190 students at Arcadia, with growth projected to 300 in the near future. This means that Arcadia College needs to expand, so the Commonwealth grant of $1.325 million will go towards stage 1 of the construction of a new facility that includes three junior secondary studios, staff offices, administration and an outdoor recreation area. It was great to visit the school and make the funding announcement with Principal Jason Sessarago, who leads a team of educators who are exceptionally dedicated to their students. I can assure you they were all very excited by the news. Well done to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to tell the House about a very worthwhile charity in my electorate that I'm supporting through my Christmas appeal. It's called Baby Give Back. The organisation is run by a group of local mums who are supporting mothers and babies who need assistance most. I'd like to acknowledge the directors: Carly Fradgley, Kylie Gregson, Ainsley McLaren and Julie McBride. Good-quality, new items that can help struggling mothers can be dropped off at my electorate office to be delivered to the charity. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  The majority of my electorate of Scullin falls within the local government boundaries of Whittlesea. This community is undergoing enormous growth at the moment, and that leads to some particular challenges. In the extended parliamentary break that we enjoyed, I was able to attend a couple of significant presentations on the challenges facing the communities which I represent. The first was a presentation by Whittlesea Community Connections, a community advocacy and support organisation about which I've often spoken in this place. It is a body that does extraordinary work on behalf of the most disadvantaged members of the communities that make up Melbourne's north.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The presentation that Whittlesea Community Connections provided to me analysed the changing profile of residents in the city of Whittlesea to inform decision-making and to deepen our understanding of the emerging trends. Their report found that, while some residents were highly educated and well skilled, others had very low levels of education and low levels of literacy. There are few entry-level jobs available in the area and there is very limited employment support for refugees. This is particularly concerning in light of this community's location as a resettlement place for Syrian refugees. From a health perspective, there are very high levels of chronic pain, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and general poor health in the community. There are also high numbers of people with disabilities. Housing affordability is a challenge. Utilities affordability is particularly poor, notwithstanding the rhetoric of the minister in this government. There is a high financial burden on people seeking family reunions—a very common issue in a community with a large population of immigrants, such as the city of Whittlesea. There are obviously very significant waiting times for language centres. There is fear and uncertainty amongst many who are facing future settlement delays, and there are concerns about legal processes and support. There is also a very high need for early childhood support and assessment. There is a desperate need to appropriately support victims of family violence—something the state government has been very serious about, something federal Labor is serious about, but something the federal government needs to take further action on. This analysis highlighted high levels of disadvantage which are not being dealt with and provides a very important framework to address those levels of disadvantage. It was backed in by the City of Whittlesea Council, and I congratulate mayor Kris Pavlidis and deputy mayor Emilia Sterjova on their election to their offices—particularly Emilia, the youngest deputy mayor ever in Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also highlighted infrastructure failings, a key issue in an outer suburban electorate. This issue is particularly compounded by the government's failure to appropriately invest in Victorian infrastructure, investing only nine per cent of Commonwealth infrastructure spending in Victoria, despite enormous population growth.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  For many years I've been concerned about the circumstances that surrounded the Commonwealth Bank's takeover of Bankwest. Despite the inquiries by two parliamentary committees and the report of Small Business Ombudsman Kate Carnell, the controversy surrounding these cases has not abated. While the Small Business Ombudsman and my parliamentary colleagues have been as thorough as they could be, they didn't have the powers of a royal commission, and neither did they have the forensic questioning ability of a royal commissioner and the associated silks. It's been my view for some time that these cases need to be properly adjudicated by a qualified person who'll be able to test the claims and counterclaims of the victims and bank executives. For some time I've been making representations to the Treasurer and other ministers about the need for an inquiry. Last week the government established a royal commission into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry. I'm pleased that aggrieved customers will now have their voices heard and their claims tested by retired High Court Judge Ken Hayne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the Commonwealth Bank's purchase of Bankwest during the global financial crisis, the Commonwealth Bank began revaluing the Bankwest commercial loan book. In many cases the value of commercial property on which loans had been made dropped dramatically. As the properties were worth less than they had been under the non-monetary default clauses in the loan agreements, the Commonwealth Bank was able to trigger the default of a business loan, even though in many cases the borrower had been meeting their regular repayments against that loan. Bankwest victims, as I understand it, do not dispute the Commonwealth Bank's right under the loan agreements to call in their loans. The central allegation of the Bankwest victims is that the Commonwealth Bank, in exercising their power under these agreements, acted in a way that might entitle the victims to the right to equitable relief for unconscionable conduct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a number of prominent constituents who've been adversely affected by the conduct of the Commonwealth Bank and who began telling me their stories in the years leading up to my election to parliament. One of my constituents, Peter McNamee, began talking to me about these issues at a Liberal Party branch meeting one night several years ago. Peter has been a member of the Liberal Party and my constituency for most of his life, including 28 years as a branch president. Peter's an engineer and second-generation property developer who was bankrupted himself in the 1990s yet dusted himself off and rebuilt a successful business. I suggested that Peter develop a policy paper for the Menzies Research Centre's small business round table, which he did in 2012. Peter wasn't a Bankwest victim, but he's become a great advocate for those victims. No-one's worked harder to get a result for them than Peter. He's been to every parliamentary inquiry and to other inquiries, met regulators and bank executives, and made submissions and policy reform suggestions. He's consulted by both regulators and bank executives today, and he's been an advocate for the royal commission. This royal commission is a direct response to people like Peter McNamee, who's a hero to me and to the victims, who will now have their chance to have their day in court, as it were.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  I'm so proud to stand up and talk for just a few moments about the great honour it is to represent my wonderful electorate of Sydney. It is an incredibly beautiful and an incredibly diverse electorate—from scenic spots like Mrs Macquarie's Chair, looking back over to the Botanic Gardens, the Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and Lord Howe Island, to suburbs that have high needs: Woolloomooloo, just a few moments walk from Mrs Macquarie's Chair, and Waterloo, Redfern, Surrey Hills and Darlinghurst and right across down south to Rosebery and Alexandria. It's a beautiful electorate, a diverse electorate, and it's a great honour to be able to represent the people of this growing city of Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a city that of course needs continued investment in public infrastructure—in education, health and transport. Instead, we've seen from the New South Wales government a reverse Midas touch, it seems. On everything they turn to in my electorate, they are doing the exact opposite of what the people of Sydney want—the $2.3 billion about to be spent on two unnecessary upgrades of stadia at Olympic Park and Allianz Stadium in Moore Park when instead we should be spending more money on public transport, health and education. We see the obsession with WestConnex, one of the worst traffic projects Sydney has ever seen, moving the traffic jams we now see on Western Sydney streets right into the centre of Sydney, instead of connecting Western Sydney with the port and the airport as the state government promised. They're just moving a traffic jam from one part of Sydney to another part of Sydney, as well as the sell-off of public housing in Millers Point, the terrible decision to move the Powerhouse Museum from Ultimo, perhaps to Parramatta, or perhaps not to reopen it at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud of my electorate despite these terrible decisions of the state government, and proud of the fact that my electorate voted 83.7 per cent 'yes' in the campaign for marriage equality. That's happened because of the terrific work of many organisations that I've already acknowledged in the chamber. But I want to make special mention of the 78ers, people who have been campaigning for equality for years. We will see, sadly, the retirement of Reverend Graham Long from Wayside Chapel at the end of next year. We've seen Elizabeth Morley hand over leadership of the Redfern Legal Centre to Joanna Shulman this year. Both of these people have made a fantastic contribution to our local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Happy 10th anniversary to Gamarada, a fantastic organisation that provides great services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men. It was wonderful to celebrate their 10th anniversary with them. Sadly, of course, we've lost a number of great local contributors this year, and I'm very sad to see a number of deaths of Labor Party members this year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  On 23 November, I attended the Carlton South Public School annual showcase down at Rockdale Town Hall. It was a fantastic night full of colour and dance and song. Carlton South Public School is one of the largest schools in my electorate, with about 600 kids. They represented it in fantastic fashion on the evening. I'd like to congratulate Patricia Floudas, the early stage 1 classroom teacher, who coordinated and organised the event, and also Principal Darren Galea for his ongoing leadership. The Carlton South Public School is a very tight-knit community with a very active P&amp;C. It's great that we have been able, through the Stronger Communities Program, to assist the P&amp;C with an important project to provide improved shade cover for the kids. It's a great school. It was a great night. Congratulations to all concerned.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 6 November, I attended the 2017 Tots to Teens 11th annual arts awards exhibition at the Bankstown Arts Centre gallery. The Bankstown Art Society was established way back in 1953 in somewhat less modern premises than it has today. The Bankstown Art Society, like a couple of similar societies in the St George part of my electorate, does a great job in creating a space in which local residents can learn about art—some people might be a little bit interested and some people might be very, very interested—and learn from professional and highly skilled artists. The great thing about the Tots to Teens exhibition is that it showcases and highlights the work of kids in our community. It was a terrific night. I would like to congratulate the president, Jim Kelly, and the secretary, Joyce Williams, for all their efforts, and also exhibition head Noela Fisher for all her work. I look forward to my next visit.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 22 November, I visited Carss Park for the annual St George Zone of Playgroups Fun Day. We have got a wide range of playgroups in our area in Oatley, Mortdale and a range of other suburbs across the Banks electorate. The Oatley playgroup runs one of the very few toy libraries in New South Wales and does a fantastic job. The fun day, as the name suggests, had lots of great activities. There was a little fire engine that kids could ride on, there were different food and drink things you could buy and lots of local businesses supporting the event. I'd like to thank Annette Ruhotas Morgan, the coordinator of the St George Zone of Playgroups, who is a volunteer. She does an amazing amount of work for a volunteer, as do so many other people involved in the playgroups of St George. It is a great organisation and one I'm proud to support.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="61378" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr EVANS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:52</span>):  Last month I spent a day in Far North Queensland with Act for Kids, who run SafeKIDS, a safe-house program running in Aurukun, Napranum, Pormpuraaw and Kowanyama. I was privileged to see the very real difference that safe houses are making in communities like Aurukun, keeping children safe by offering emergency short-term and long-term accommodation in community for children who aren't able to live at home at that time. Act for Kids is a charity based in my electorate, in Brisbane. They offer the safe houses in partnership with the traditional owners and the Queensland government's Department of Communities, Child Safety and Disability Services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The safe-house concept was formed in response to the challenges faced by many Indigenous children, and young people under child protection orders, being placed in care outside of their communities—sometimes a very long way away, making it impossible for them to maintain their family, community and cultural connections. The program provides safe and culturally appropriate home facilities for children up to 17 years of age, allowing them to remain with their communities and stay connected to their families, culture and country while their ongoing child protection needs are assessed and implemented. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the whole Brisbane community, I want to record my thanks and appreciation to Act for Kids for its great efforts in helping make our country a better place. I want to thank all of the Act for Kids team, their staff and volunteers, all ably led by their CEO, Neil Carrington, for their hard work and passion for child safety. I really enjoyed being able to have frank and meaningful conversations with many of them about their success stories, the challenges they confront and the opportunities in front of us all. I also want to thank, in passing, tireless child safety advocate Kay McGrath for accompanying us on the visit and for her dedication to the cause over so many years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reflecting on what we saw and heard there, I want to give honourable members a sense of how these safe houses are truly making the community safer. Safety really is a necessary precondition for any community where we're trying to help people succeed and thrive. Sometimes as policymakers we surely fail to appreciate how many of the usual policy options can fall away in challenging or remote conditions. Without safety, we can't expect to have young people going to school, learning, working and growing as individuals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The safe houses are now the biggest employers in some of these communities, where the only other employer is often the local retail store. Act for Kids itself has a predominantly Indigenous staff, and I witnessed huge respect across the communities for the safe houses and for what they represent: the children and the very future of those communities. Act for Kids deserves our support and greater awareness.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Howarth—and I'm no Les Murray! My electorate of Macarthur is the most rapidly growing electorate in New South Wales. Property prices have rapidly increased, and so have mortgages. The average household has 2.2 cars, and the majority of workers travel to work by motor vehicle, with each vehicle having one occupant. The population of the area is expected to double in the next 20 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new aristocracy, or perhaps not so new, are those that own large parcels of land now available for subdivision. The New South Wales government has just announced over 40,000 new home lots for the area yet no new public transport infrastructure. The federal government is building the Western Sydney Airport without any real commitment to a rail link to Sydney. The New South Wales government reaps billions of dollars in stamp duty revenue from families moving to Macarthur, yet it does not provide adequate transport infrastructure, adequate health infrastructure and adequate public school infrastructure. Many people spend two to three hours travel time to and from work every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've made a submission to the Greater Sydney Commission outlining the above, and I think they have the will to do better, but, with the present state and federal Liberal governments, we're getting a very poor response. We've relied on motor vehicles in south-western Sydney for decades, and it's only going to get worse. We already have very poor air quality, and we'll have air quality of the level of New Delhi, I think, in the next few years unless something's done to reduce our reliance on motor vehicles. Long travel times increase stresses on families, give less time with children and reduce productivity. There's no doubt about that, yet the federal and state Liberal Party governments are quite discriminatory in their attitude to infrastructure. They're providing lots of infrastructure in inner Sydney, in northern and north-west Sydney and in eastern Sydney, yet to south-western Sydney they're providing nothing. The people of south-western Sydney have been forsaken by the Prime Minister and the New South Wales Premier, who are happy to spend billions of dollars of state revenue on stadiums that are quite functional and don't need to be rebuilt and on doubling up the transport infrastructure in inner Sydney and in eastern Sydney yet give nothing to south-west Sydney.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  A group of seven students from St Carthage's Primary School, a Catholic school in Lismore, travelled to Flinders University in Adelaide recently to represent New South Wales in the social science division of the Tournament of Minds. Competing against thousands of students from across Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam and Thailand, the St Carthage's students took out top honours, walking away as the Australasian Pacific champions in the primary school division after also winning the New South Wales regional competition. I'd like to congratulate Charlotte Gilliland, Henry Lawrence, Layla O'Reilly, Clare Young, Jack Furness, Hilde Andreasen and Neve Schweizer. I'd also like to thank the team's facilitator, Jenifer Thomson, and the principal of St Carthage's, Janelle Heffernan, and all the staff at St Carthage's for fostering academic excellence in their students.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well done to the Trinity Catholic College year 10 commerce students who won the recent New South Wales Mock Mediation Competition. The winning team comprised Nick Ledwith, Zara Webb, Tahlia Brien, Zoe Wood, Emilie Hughes, Sage Stein, Tory Puglisi, Haley Laarhoven, Heidi Pearson-Roden, James Sanderson and Tayla O'Reilly. Emilie Hughes also won the Student Advocacy Prize for being the best advocate in the state. The teacher behind the team was Jo Morgan, who was very proud and said they had worked extremely hard, having given up three lunchtimes a week since February to practise. Well done, Jo. In order to make the grand final, the school had to compete in a series of round robins, progressing on to the quarter finals, the semi finals and then the grand final, which was held in Sydney, against St Patrick's College, Campbelltown. Well done to everyone involved.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The KTM Junior Supercross Challenge is a unique opportunity for children to experience the life of a professional supercross rider. Eight-year-old Zane Thompson from Corindi Beach was recently chosen as one of 20 lucky aspiring supercross riders to experience the thrill of racing in front of a packed-out crowd at the 2017 AUS-X Open. Participants ride bikes fitted with ready-to-race kits and are required to navigate the entire supercross track, which includes large and technical obstacles. Riders are chosen based on their riding ability and school report card. Competing at the Qudos Bank Arena, which had been filled with mounds of dirt to create jumps, burns and whoops, Zane won his race in front of a massive crowd of 20,000 supercross fans. Zane's parents, Michael and Stacey, will certainly have their hands full when the local motorcross season starts soon, with their two other boys, Nate, 10, and Levi, six, who are also keen motocross riders. I wish them all the very best.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2017 is a sad and accurate reflection of the Turnbull government. It is weak, it is insufficient, it is largely ineffectual and it is too little too late. I want to set out my strongly-held personal view at the outset. Let's be very clear: Australia's global anti-money-laundering rules are appallingly, embarrassingly weak. We all—Liberal, Labor and everyone else in this parliament—need to lift our game. It's gone on for too long. Allegations that the Commonwealth Bank breached these laws on almost 54,000 occasions are bad enough. That raises serious concerns about the weakness of the current laws and shows how badly exposed Australia in fact is to highly sophisticated organised money-laundering syndicates that operate globally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the reality is far worse and the problems are much wider than the banking sector. Most Australians, I believe, would be shocked to know that Australia's laws don't even cover key sectors of the economy. The so-called gatekeepers—real estate agents, accountants and lawyers—are not covered at all. In fact, by global standards, we are now way behind good practice. Transparency International published their assessment of Australia in March this year. Australia failed in all 10 priority areas. We were ranked worst in the Anglosphere. The global regulator of money laundering, the Financial Action Task Force, published their most recent evaluation in 2015. It's shocking reading. Australian homes are a safe haven for dodgy money, with particular concerns about Chinese funds. Australia's regime is not compliant with six key international standards, and, embarrassingly, Australia was placed on a watchlist, given our ongoing failure to comply with terrorism financing and money-laundering reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government talks a big game on national security and crime. We heard it today in question time: tough on crime, tough on national security. But it's hot air, because in this area they're way behind what's needed and need to lift their game and do so quickly. Serious risks exist. This is not trivial stuff. This is not people stealing five bucks from a bank. It is terrorism financing, and it is facilitating serious criminals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is manifestly insufficient. It implements the first set of recommendations from a 2016 statutory review. At first glance you might think this is reasonable progress—first tranche, off we go!—but it's not. These issues have been hanging around unfixed for over a decade, and this bill does, at best, I would estimate, about five per cent of what is needed. It is 11 years since the Howard government introduced what they said was the first tranche of the legislation, back in 2006, and since then it has not been fixed. We have had our period in government, and I will talk about that later on. This is the fifth year that these guys have been in government. This is not good enough. We don't need more reviews; we need the government to lift their game and introduce comprehensive amendments to the legislation, which is currently riddled with loopholes and gaps and is too weak for the threats that we face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the bill is fiddling around the edges and the biggest gap is still the lack of coverage for real estate agents, lawyers and accountants, which this bill doesn't even touch on. The most urgent issue—and I'll make some remarks on this—in my view, is real estate agents and it's less complex, in fact, than the others. Why do I say it is most urgent? International experience in the USA suggests this is a major area for money laundering and potentially counterterrorism financing. For over 10 years we have been warned that we have a similar problem in Australia and we've done nothing. The difference is the US are now at least doing something tangible about it. In August this year, the US government extended a pilot program to crack down on dodgy real estate deals after 30 per cent of high-end real estate deals checked out under the US Treasury program involved people targeted for potential money laundering and suspicious activity. The program was expanded to cover luxury real estate deals in the big US markets to stop real estate money laundering by overseas buyers. It's a scary warning of what may be going on in Australia, completely unseen. We have seen an enormous flow of funds and alarm bells have been rung by our regulator and academics for years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The FIRB data is the best available of what's going on. It does slightly overstate things because it is based on approvals, not completions, but it is, as I said, the best available. To give you a sense of the scale, in 2015-16 $122 billion of foreign direct investment stock was approved in the real estate sector. That included about $50 billion of commercial and about $72 billion of residential. China was the top source country, with $31.9 billion in residential. Other top source countries included the USA, Singapore, the UAE, Canada and Hong Kong. AUSTRAC's 2015 strategic analysis brief, <span style="font-style:italic;">Money</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">laundering through real estate</span>, recognised that this was a well-established money-laundering method in Australia. I'm not making this stuff up. This has been sitting there. It's from the regulator to the government and they haven't acted. They also said that, compared to other methods, this could be:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… relatively uncomplicated, requiring little planning or expertise. Large sums of illicit funds can be concealed and integrated into the legitimate economy through real estate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the international regulator's 2015 report specifically identified China as one of the countries from which laundering through Australian real estate was suspected to take place. To be clear, the Chinese authorities cooperate with us extensively in cracking down on money laundering where it's identified. There's no question about that. The problem remains that our systems to pick up dodgy transactions are appallingly weak.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it is not just Chinese criminal money that's a worry. Media reports over years abound of stolen funds from Papua New Guinea's coffers being laundered in Australia—more than $200 million in 2014, including through real estate. There was a shocking <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> article in 2015 outlining how Malaysian officials bid up the price of an apartment block by $4 million over the value and then had kickbacks and dodgy invoices. Yet, today, the fact remains that Australian properties can still be bought and sold willy-nilly without any due diligence on the parties. Firstly, there are no requirements for real estate agents or related professionals involved in real estate deals to submit suspicious transaction reports, even if they suspect illegal activity. Secondly, there are no requirements to disclose the identity of individuals or beneficial owners behind foreign companies purchasing property in our country. Thirdly, there are no effective controls then of the practice of criminals buying and selling properties in quick succession to confuse the audit trail. I'm not making that up, either. Successive AUSTRAC reports from 2007 onwards have highlighted exactly that practice—you buy something, you sell it, you buy it, you sell it, you buy it, you sell it and, before you know it, the audit trail has no idea who originally owned it. Also, it links with other illegal activities such as drugs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a report on the SBS in recent times where the CEO of Chinese international property investments website juwai.com said that 70 per cent of their clients pay in cash. This poses clear risks given that money sent through a financial institution like a bank would be assessed and reportable under the counterterrorism or anti-money-laundering legislation. AUSTRAC's brief included two specific examples of the proceeds of corruption in China being traced to real estate assets in Australia. I have some small exposure to the integrity issues around the investment side of things through my previous work in the Public Service managing business and investment migration. Checks are done quite carefully and thoughtfully on people seeking visas here and, yet, you can just move money in and out in this way because it's simply not captured by the regime in the real estate sector.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that we can identify and stop suspect and corrupt transactions, not only to comply with our international obligations but also, importantly, because of the inflationary impact on property prices in Australia from funds that are not being properly and commercially invested. To their credit, the Attorney-General's Department acknowledged this in its recent discussion paper, on page 6:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is likely to be an attractive destination for the investment of foreign proceeds of crime in real estate … [This] allows criminals to conceal and enjoy the profits from their crimes, but also can lead to the artificial inflation of property prices, as the criminal may be willing to pay more than the fair market value to secure a safe investment which minimises the chance of detection.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Residents in my electorate are extremely concerned about the impact of foreign investment on residential property values—for example, in Glen Waverley, which is a hotspot of concern within Melbourne. And I continue to get reports, almost every week and certainly every month, of dodgy transactions that are not properly regulated or caught, and the government has to act. A discussion paper with no commitment to implementation and no time line is simply not good enough.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I'd make is in regard to disrupting terrorist networks. Extending the regime to cover the gatekeepers is also critically important to ensure that we can stop terrorists and their support networks. The December 2016 report published by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute was titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Detect, disrupt and deny: optimising Australia's counterterrorism financing system</span>. It includes two case studies of concluded terrorism financing convictions in Australia in relation to al-Qaeda and the Tamil Tigers. Importantly—and this is important—the No. 1 recommendation for improving Australia's counterterrorism regime is: what do you think it was, Member for Brand?</span>

                    </a>  It's catchy, I know—and ensure that Australia's anti-money-laundering regime and counterterrorism financing regime is consistent with global standards. Money is the lifeblood of terrorist organisations. Who knew? It's necessary for obtaining weapons, mounting attacks, sustaining members and facilitating recruitment and propaganda. Detecting, disrupting, and denying terrorist financing is a powerful means of countering the terrorist threats posed to international peace and security.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, this is not trivial stuff. The government needs to commit unequivocally to fixing this within the next few months. And the signs are not great. Worryingly, the Minister for Justice—he of the sparkling personality, one of the government's two secret weapons that they deploy to us in question time, to bore us to death; he's neck and neck for the gold medal with the Minister for Urban Infrastructure in the 'Boring Olympics'—stated in July: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Seriously: 'robust'! Robust, Member for Dawson. I'd hate to see what he thinks are lax arrangements, then, if he considers our arrangements to be 'robust'. The real estate lobby are hostile or lukewarm—quelle surprise!—about the need to even do anything. The REIA are sort of a bit cleverer: they kind of don't oppose it, but they seek a light-touch approach. Okay. The REIA Queensland, from the member for Dawson's neck of the woods, of course opposes this outright and says that these serious risks should just be dealt with by continuing professional development and awareness training—send them a memo; send them a fax. Give me a break. 'Trust me; I'm a real estate agent.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm gravely concerned that the government will continue to go slow or quietly cave. The status quo cannot be allowed to prevail. The minister must come in here when summing up this debate and state unequivocally that the government will extend the regime to real estate agents in a meaningful way within six months. Enough is enough. The Attorney-General should stop measuring the curtains at Australia House in London and get this fixed before he leaves. The cost-benefit regulatory analysis was to be completed by mid-June 2017. I haven't heard anything about that. Anything short of a time-bound commitment is weasel words and should be called out by all members, the media and the public. And I say this to my party, because we have been in government and not dealt with this: we need to stand firm and be very clear, unambiguously, that if the government fails to act then we in government will—no weasel words. Time doesn't permit a detailed account and comments in relation to the need to extend the regime to accountants and lawyers. Suffice it to say that that case is also strong and coverage is well overdue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once we've dealt with real estate agents, accountants should be the next cab off the rank, and there are pretty well-thought-out models around. Submissions to the statutory review from the various professional bodies—I got a bit nerdy and read some of them—including the CPA, proposed a two- to three-year transition period with some broadly sensible caveats. I acknowledge also the particular issues in relation to the legal profession—it is more complex—and think the Law Council of Australia's submission does provide a way forward. Whilst the Law Council strongly opposes, in principle, the extension of the regime to lawyers—'trust us, we're lawyers'—it goes on to signal a sensible way forward if it is so extended, which is always the bit you have to read. There are things like excluding legally privileged information—fair enough—and making arrangements for barristers so they don't drown that profession in red tape and can rely on the arrangements put in place by law firms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, enough is enough. This has gone on for too long. The laws were introduced in 2006. They were the first of an anticipated two tranches of legislation to bring Australia into line with international best practice. Eleven years ago, it was expected the second phase would follow soon after, but 11 years on we're still waiting. At the tail end of the Howard government—most of that government was its tail end—in 2007, they flagged that consultation would progress on the form of the second tranche. There was even draft legislation—it's kind of out there—10 or 11 years ago. The Rudd government continued work and did have industry roundtables but put the reforms on hold for a few years, given the impact of the GFC on business, which made sense at the time. But that time has passed and there is no excuse, no reasonable explanation, for the ongoing delay. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government started their review in 2013—that's four years ago. You're in your fifth year, government, and all we have is another review, another half-done first tranche, which doesn't even pick up on all that it was supposed to. I will use my last half a minute to point out that this bill pretends to implement the first tranche but mysteriously misses many recommendations, with no explanation. Recommendation 4.8, about digital currency wallets, is just not there, along with recommendations 14.1 and 14.2 about secrecy and access amendments, and at least five others. It remains entirely unclear whether a decision has been taken to not proceed with those reforms or whether they're in the never-never. In conclusion, I take this matter seriously and I think the government should do, too.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:17</span>):  I'm pleased to contribute to the debate on the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2017. We know that Australia has experienced some sustained pressure from many stakeholders across the globe to strengthen our anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing regime. This has been consistent over the past decade. In the course of this debate I think it's safe to say that both sides of the parliament understand that this piece of legislation is well overdue for an update. The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 is the principal legislative instrument to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. It establishes reporting regimes for prescribed entities and provides procedures which reporting entities must go through to properly identify customers before engaging in transactions, including international and domestic fund transfers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Hotham, the shadow justice minister, noted in her remarks, taking the profit motive out of crime is one of the key elements to maintaining law and order. Therefore our anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing legislation is immensely important within this objective. There's an urgent need for reform and it's well demonstrated in the scandal involving the Commonwealth Bank, in which AUSTRAC had initiated civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court against the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for serious and systemic noncompliance with the existing Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements a first phase of reforms arising from the recommendations of the report on the statutory review of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and the associated rules and regulations. I won't go through all of the details of the bill—we all know them. What I do want to say is, although it is acknowledged that this bill implements only the first phase of the necessary reforms, it's important that all aspects of the bill are as strong and as robust as possible. While Labor are supportive of this bill on the basis of an initial review, we are concerned that the bill may not go far enough, particularly in light of the recent scandals that I have just referred to, including that involving the Commonwealth Bank and many others. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2015-16 report of the Financial Action Task Force, part of the global body responsible for setting and monitoring international standards on combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism, found that Australia's regime for anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing was noncompliant with at least six international anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing standards. This report called on the regulator, AUSTRAC, to pursue a more aggressive enforcement agenda, recommending:</span>

It spruiks its record on national security with photo opportunities in front of tanks—everyone wearing helmets and maybe some fatigues, with a few guns in the background. It talks almost obsessively from one side of its mouth about cracking down on organised crime and terrorism, while from the other side it refuses to invest in law enforcement or commit to meaningful regulation and oversight of the banks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are some facts: the very same year in which that criticism of our financial intelligence agency was made by the global organisation the Financial Action Task Force, AUSTRAC actually sustained a $7 million cut from the Abbott Liberal government's 2014-15 budget. So, while Australia was being told to ramp up its anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing efforts and enforcement, the Liberal government cut eight per cent of AUSTRAC's budget. The government is cutting funding to AUSTRAC—the body that is supposed to be monitoring these institutions and enforcing our laws. I note that the 2016-17 budget contains a $19 million cut to AUSTRAC's work to protect the financial system from criminal abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen, of course, in recent days that the government have rolled over and decided to hold a royal commission into the banking and financial sector. Despite resisting Labor's calls until the eleventh hour, they are now talking big on how they plan to clean up misconduct in the banks. Despite all of this—despite the smoke and mirrors by this government—Labor, in particular the member for Hotham, the shadow minister for justice, and the member for Isaacs, the shadow Attorney-General, are willing and eager to work with the government over the coming months on the more significant challenges Australia faces in responding to money laundering and terrorism financing. It's very clear that Labor's not going to stand in the way of legislation that strengthens our anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing regime. To be clear, this is an issue with direct bearing on our national security, and we don't do smoke and mirrors; we do the real, substantive stuff, the real work that's necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It must be said that the ripping of millions upon millions of dollars out of AUSTRAC at the same time as professing to strengthen it through this particular legislation is just another example of the con job of this government. Despite that, I call on the government to work with Labor to ensure we deliver robust legislation which will underpin the safety and security of all Australians.</span>

That report was tabled in the parliament on 29 April 2016.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The AML/CTF Act provides the basis for regulation of certain businesses by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, AUSTRAC. The regulatory framework established under the AML/CTF Act and the FTR Act provides for the collection of information from the private sector, and from inbound and outbound travellers, about the movement of money and other assets. AUSTRAC shares this information with associated financial intelligence and designated agencies, non-designated Commonwealth agencies and AUSTRAC's international counterparts in order to combat money laundering, terrorism financing and other serious crimes. This bill aims to strengthen some of those provisions that exist in Australia at the moment, specifically by expanding the objects of the AML/CTF Act to reflect the domestic objectives of such regulation, to bring digital currency exchange providers into the regime, to provide regulatory relief for industry, to strengthen AUSTRAC's investigation and enforcement powers, and to give police and customs officers broader powers to search and seize physical currency and bearer negotiable instruments and establish civil penalties for failing to comply with questioning and search powers. The proposals also revise the definitions of 'investigating officer', 'signatory' and 'stored value card', and they expand the rule-making powers of the AUSTRAC CEO across a number of areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of a strong AML/CTF regime in counterterrorism financing cannot be overstated. Money laundering and terrorism financing are relentless threats. The criminal networks that lie beneath impact on all levels of society, from the state to the individual. The Paradise Papers recently have shown how easily money can be moved and held overseas in opaque corporate structures away from regulatory scrutiny. These methods can be utilised readily by criminals seeking to clean their cash, finance terrorism or prop up corrupt regimes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the country was rocked by money-laundering allegations and actions that were aimed at the Commonwealth Bank after AUSTRAC alleged, in August, that the bank had failed to properly report more than 53,000 large cash transactions through its intelligent deposit machines between 2012 and 2015. Basically, these machines allow people to deposit up to 200 notes at a time, and often they are able to do that multiple times, onto a key card or a particular card from which an individual can't be identified. The actions that have been taken by AUSTRAC are unprecedented, and the alleged nature of the breaches of any money-laundering laws really highlights the necessity for a banking royal commission and also for the strengthening of associated laws in banking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this, the government has been attempting to avoid a royal commission into the banks for some months now in Australia. They've been eager to ensure that proper scrutiny wasn't entered into in terms of bank behaviour, particularly in some of the big four banks and the scandals and rip-offs that we've seen there. For the last 600 days, the Prime Minister has been saying: 'No, we won't be having a royal commission. There's no need for one.' He's been ignoring the pleas of the victims of the banks, the whistleblowers and the people who've said that we need a royal commission in this country, including many members of parliament and senators, particularly those senators who were involved in the initial Commonwealth Bank inquiry into wealth management scandals who recommended, on a bipartisan basis through a Senate committee report, that there should be a royal commission in this country. The Prime Minister denied that. Yet, when the big four banks write to the Prime Minister and say, 'We want a royal commission,' the Prime Minister rolls over and gives them exactly that. This, of course, came not from the realisation of the extent of some of the shonky actions and the rotten culture of the big banks but from a request from the banks themselves. If ever there has been any evidence that the government was acting in the interests of the banks, this backflip is it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing regime is long overdue for an update. In 2015, the Financial Action Task Force, the global body responsible for setting and monitoring international standards on combatting money laundering and the financing of terrorism, found that Australia's AML/CTF regime was non-compliant with six international AML/CTF standards. The FATF called on our regulator, AUSTRAC, to pursue a more aggressive enforcement agenda, recommending that Australia should focus more on effective supervision and enforcement of individual reporting entities and compliance with AML/CTF obligations within various sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the same year that these recommendations were made, AUSTRAC sustained a $7 million budget cut. It was the Abbott Liberal government that has been cutting funding for AUSTRAC over the forward estimates. AUSTRAC sustained a $7 million budget cut under the Abbott government's 2014-15 budget. When Australia was being told to ramp up our AML/CTF enforcement, the Liberal government had cut eight per cent of AUSTRAC's budget. Breaches of our AML/CTF regime are an issue of international and national security and we can't afford to take that threat lightly. In this time of heightened anxiety and international alarm, and being aware of and on notice about terrorism incidents, we need to ensure that the regulators, principally those bodies that are working to uncover terrorism financing and money laundering, are adequately resourced to do their job. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, yet again this government is cutting funding for AUSTRAC. The 2016-17 budget contains a $19 million cut to AUSTRAC's work protecting the financial system from criminal abuse. As I said, in the context of what's going on internationally this defies belief. It absolutely defies belief that as a nation we face increased threats from global terrorism and sophisticated criminal syndicates seeking to move their ill-gotten gains around the globe for nefarious purposes, and yet this government is cutting resources from the regulatory bodies that are charged with tracking down this behaviour and protecting our country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, Labor does support this bill and the elements that will strengthen the AML/CTF regime, particularly giving the AUSTRAC CEO the power to issue infringement notices for a greater range of regulatory offences and allowing the CEO to issue remedial direction to a reporting entity to retrospectively comply with an obligation that has been breached, and giving police and Customs officers broader powers to search and seize. The bill will also bring digital currency exchange providers such as Bitcoin into the AML/CTF regime. However, the government has taken a particularly light touch approach to this reform. Under the government's proposal, digital currency exchange providers would only need to report transactions on physical currency of $10,000 or more. This is despite the fact that their own consultation paper on digital currencies proposed that a threshold of zero dollars apply to digital currency exchange providers and disclosure. So it's a lighter touch than would otherwise be the case. Nonetheless, Labor do support this bill because we recognise the need for strong laws in this space and the increased threat posed by ever-advancing criminal syndicates, and I commend the bill to the Federation Chamber. </span>

                  </a>  I thank the chamber. I rise to make a statement in relation to citizenship. In 2007, I was nominated for election to the Senate as a candidate for the Australian Labor Party. As a part of my nomination process I completed a form entitled 'Checklist for eligibility', which asked if my parents or grandparents were citizens of another country. This vetting process was compulsory for all Labor candidates. As a result of this check, I was advised by the ALP national secretariat that, as my father was born in Northern Ireland, I should renounce my citizenship entitlements under British law. I was also advised that out of an abundance of caution I should also renounce any entitlements under Irish law. I can advise the House that neither I nor my father, nor any other member of my family, is or has been an Irish citizen, nor have any of them taken any steps to enliven any entitlements to Irish citizenship. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In October 2007, I signed the documents prepared for me in accordance with the advice, renouncing my rights and any other rights to which I might have been entitle, and I understood that they had been sent to the British and Irish governments. As a part of the universal disclosure process, I contacted the British high commission regarding the declaration of renunciation I made in October 2007 to request a copy of that notice. In subsequent correspondence, the high commission informed me that they were having difficulty locating this information. They had checked with the UK Home Office, which deals with these kinds of queries, and they stated that they do not keep records for such long periods of time—from which I understand they could not locate my notice of renunciation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to establish that this form was indeed submitted in 2007, I have inquiries outstanding with the UK Home Office to confirm, firstly, whether my original documents, such as my notice of renunciation from October 2007, would have been destroyed, whether addressed to the Home Office or the high commission; and whether there are any other historical or archival searches which may be made to locate my declaration of renunciation. I have also sought past bank records from more than 10 years ago to determine whether I made a payment processed by the UK Home Office at the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the best of my memory from a decade ago, I followed the advice I received and sent renunciations to both UK and Irish authorities. It, of course, makes no logical sense that I would do one and not the other. However, I accept that I have been unable to produce the requisite notice of renunciation with respect to the United Kingdom. I remain hopeful that continuing searches of UK records in archives will clarify this matter in my favour. Nonetheless, I accept that at this moment my status as a citizen in UK law remains unclear. On this basis, if the relevant documents have not been located by the time this issue is dealt with in the House of Representatives, I will be asking the Manager of Opposition Business to refer this matter to the High Court. I thank the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="13050" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:34</span>):  I rise to speak on the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2017. As speakers before me have stated, this is the first phase of reforms from the recommendation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Report on the statutory review of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and associated rules and regulations</span>. As speakers before me have also stated, Labor broadly support the proposed bill. Our anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism-financing regime is long overdue for an update. Too often we are left playing catch-up with terrorists and organised crime groups instead of being ahead of the curve and focusing on what we can do in prevention and early intervention as opposed to disruption.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Way back in 2015, the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, which is the global body responsible for setting and monitoring international standards in this space, declared that Australia's regime was noncompliant with six international standards. Broadly, the task force recommended that Australia should focus more on effective supervision and enforcement of individual reporting entities' compliance with the AML/CTF obligations within various sectors and not just the financial sector. The importance of this cannot be underestimated or overemphasised. As I said, we cannot continue to play catch-up with terrorists and criminals, who continue to find ways to fund their destructive activities under the watch of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time as the task force was making these recommendations, the Abbott Liberal government ripped $7 million from AUSTRAC in the 2014-15 budget. This government likes to talk big on how tough it is on crime and national security. What could be more important to our national security than cutting off the flow of finances to terrorist groups? Terrorists and organised criminals rely on these funds. They rely on them to set up training camps, to develop their influence propaganda, to recruit would-be terrorists and to finance transnational and domestic terror attacks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Supporters of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, or Daesh, and other jihadist and terrorist organisations are actively looking to and promoting the use of new and emerging technologies such as bitcoin to mitigate some of the risks associated with traditional fund transfer methods. Indeed, some websites associated with terrorist organisations have started to collect donations in bitcoin. It's not rocket science to understand how attractive it is for terrorists and criminals to use cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin for financing, because they offer anonymity, they have global reach, and they're fast, final, cheap, easy to use and difficult to track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are things we've known for years, and yet this government has sat on its hands and done nothing about it. So exactly how tough are you on national security when you refuse to acknowledge this, you refuse to do anything about it and then, to top it off, you rip money out of the regime that is responsible for enforcement? The recent charges by AUSTRAC against the Commonwealth Bank around alleged breaches of money laundering and antiterrorism laws are extremely serious and, indeed, deeply concerning. So why will this government not ensure that financial institutions and companies are doing the right thing in not allowing their facilities to be used to fund crime?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here I refer to recommendations 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the FATF report that explicitly relate to customer due diligence and record keeping. Recommendation 10, for example, states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Financial institutions should be prohibited from keeping anonymous accounts or accounts in … fictitious names.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Commonwealth Bank case, we saw the bank allegedly accepting cash deposits through intelligent deposit machines, followed by international and domestic transfers. The bank is alleged to have failed to report cash transactions totalling $624.7 million made through these machines to AUSTRAC in time for assessment, thereby failing to comply with the requirements of AUSTRAC and failing to assess the risk of money laundering or terrorism financing. Yet this government, in its 2016-17 budget, cut $19 million from AUSTRAC, again impacting negatively on AUSTRAC's ability to do the kind of work that is necessary to protect the financial system from criminal abuse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has been dragged, kicking and screaming, like a two-year-old having a tantrum, to finally calling for a royal commission into the banking and financial sector. And make no mistake: this is not a show of the Prime Minister's strength or concern about the criminal abuse of the financial system. This was not prompted by a concern for the victims of unscrupulous dealings by the banking sector. It was not a sudden change in the Prime Minister's consciousness or an epiphany of compassion and care that caused him to backflip so spectacularly on a banking royal commission. No. This was prompted by one thing and one thing only: the Prime Minister's desperate attempt to keep his job. He has time and time again opposed a royal commission and, only now, when the big four banks have said, 'Oh, okay; I guess you should do it,' decided that, 'Hey, maybe Labor have been right on this all along.' I hope that the process will be a fair and transparent one that delivers for the victims of the banking sector. But, to be honest, I'm not holding my breath.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government beats its chest and talks big on cracking down on organised crime and terrorism. There's hardly a day goes by in question time when the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection do not stand up and crow about how tough they are. But the proof of the pudding is in the eating, to use an appropriately festive phrase. Despite all their chest beating and crowing, they've failed. They've failed to invest in law enforcement and failed to commit to any meaningful regulation and oversight of the financial system and the non-financial sector to ensure that it's not abused by criminals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And they've failed to recognise and respond to the gaps in our capabilities and capacity to really deal with trends in terrorist financing. Our law enforcement agencies do not have the capacity to deal with terrorist immigration to the dark web and the use of cryptocurrencies for financing their activities. I have yet to hear one person from the government—including the Minister for Justice, who just doesn't seem to get any of this—speak about this issue or even recognise it as an issue. We have a Minister for Justice who simply doesn't have the capability to do his job in this space. He's like a deer in the headlights. He doesn't understand the area and he takes little interest in what legislative changes are needed to effectively act on terrorist financing and what capacity building we need to ensure that our agencies are well equipped to keep ahead of trends.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendations 15 and 30 of the FATF report speak specifically to this. Recommendation 15 states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Countries and financial institutions should identify and assess the money laundering or terrorist financing risks that may arise in relation to (a) the development of new products and … the use of new or developing technologies … </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 30 states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Countries should ensure that designated law enforcement authorities have responsibility for money laundering and terrorist financing investigations … ensure that competent authorities have responsibility for expeditiously identifying, tracing and initiating actions to freeze and seize property …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 31 states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Countries should ensure that competent authorities conducting investigations are able to use a wide range of investigative techniques …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have a minister for immigration who stands up and screams about national security and puffs out his chest to look like the tough guy, but has absolutely no idea what his own government is doing to undermine the ability of Australia's regime to comply with international standards in anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing by ripping money from AUSTRAC. You couldn't get a more ineffective pair of ministers when it comes to actually doing something about national security and counterterrorism: ineffective, inexperienced, unknowledgeable and utterly clueless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this bill goes some way to addressing some of the concerns in the FATF report, it falls short of addressing all of them. It will be effective in expanding the objects of the AML/CTF act, bringing digital currency exchange providers such as bitcoin into the AML/CTF regime, giving the CEO of AUSTRAC the power to issue infringement notices for a greater range of regulatory offences, allowing the CEO of AUSTRAC to issue a remedial direction to a reporting entity to retrospectively comply with an obligation that has been breached, and giving the police and Customs broader powers of search and seizure for AML/CTF breaches. But it will not completely address all of recommendation 4 in relation to the Vienna and Palermo conventions and the Terrorist Financing Convention. Importantly, it doesn't cover non-financial businesses and professions including casinos, real estate agents, dealers in precious metals, lawyers and notaries, and trust and company service providers—all of which are mentioned under recommendations 22 and 23 of the FATF report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a top destination for money laundering. That's primarily due to our lax rules around accountants, lawyers and real estate agents. We simply can't allow this to continue. Yes, we have a bill that goes some way to addressing the lax standards in our regime. But simultaneously ripping out money from AUSTRAC while only addressing part of the recommendations made by the FATF report way back in 2015 will not completely address the issue at hand. We need to be able to look at where our gaps in capability are and fill in those gaps, whether it's through a legislative instrument or whether it is providing more resources and better resources to our law enforcement agencies, and to the regime to enable it to do its job in stopping money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, while Labor supports this legislation in so far as it strengthens our anti-money-laundering and CT financing regime, we will be carefully examining the details to ensure that this piece of legislation is sufficiently robust to address the current gaps in that regime. Like the speakers before me, I too reach out to the government to say: Labor is willing to work with you on this. This can only be achieved by a bipartisan approach in which we collectively look at what those gaps are, use our expertise on both sides to identify those gaps and fill those gaps through a more robust legislative framework.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="font-weight:bold;">):</span>  What a great benefit it has been to have the member for Cowan in this parliament bringing to our deliberations her perspective, experience and expertise on this subject. I welcome her to our caucus. It's been a privilege to work with her in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Kingsford Smith and the member for Cowan have rehearsed, there are many issues associated with the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2017 that are of concern in relation to the general government approach to security. Labor works very assiduously in attempting to have a bipartisan approach to security matters and we wouldn't normally air issues about these things in public. But we're greatly disturbed by what is transpiring in the House in relation to the shameless politicisation of security—particularly the references to China, which are extraordinary when you consider the hypocrisy and irony of that. Consider, for example, that the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister were wined and dined by Chinese communications company Huawei in China and both came back vigorously advocating for that company's participation in the NBN, regardless of and despite the fact that our security agencies strongly recommended against that. I'm well aware of the detail of that advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Andrew Robb, former member and former minister, presided over a FIRB process that allowed the sale of the port of Darwin, a significant strategic asset, to the Chinese, a cause of great consternation to the Americans. They let us know that in no uncertain terms. The lack of consultation over that, as a minimum, was a significant issue in the relationship, because we both use that as a military asset as well. You can add to that the sale of Ausgrid in New South Wales, where Ausgrid managed significant defence infrastructure, and Treasury in the FIRB process did not consult at all with Defence over that sale. Defence had to raise the red flag, so to speak, in that process. When we were in government, Labor endeavoured to set up and manage our own data centres, but then the new government, wanting to save money, looked at leasing data centres, one of which, Global Switch, was handling much sensitive material and was subsequently the subject of a Chinese takeover, raising alarm bells again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to this legislation, as my colleagues have detailed, AUSTRAC features prominently in what we seek to deliver in tackling terrorism financing. The attacks on AUSTRAC's budget are of great concern, as are the delays which we've seen as this matter is dealt with. The legislation of 2006 provided for a seven-year review of the operation, which is as it should be, because we see a lot of evolutionary trends in this area. It's a daily challenge to keep track of the morphing of financial movements and technological developments, as the member for Cowan highlighted, particularly in relation to cryptographically based digital currencies like bitcoin, which is not covered in the current arrangements under the act. That seven-year review commenced in December of 2013, and the minister didn't table the report until 29 April 2016. That was three years, so there was not a great deal of urgency in the processing of that. This legislation is also supposedly dealing with phase 1. I'll come back in a moment to what our government did in relation to terrorism financing, and the deficiencies of this government on that very serious matter, but we hope that, in the next phases of this legislative process, many of these issues that aren't addressed in this legislation are picked up, because they are necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent revelation of upwards of 55,000 breaches of the anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism-financing legislation, just in relation to one bank, one financial institution, is deeply concerning. The royal commission that has been announced into the banks must include terms of reference that deal with that issue if this government wants to be serious about his credentials on counter-terrorism-financing, otherwise their treatment of terrorism-financing will be a complete joke and farce. That must happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll briefly canvas some of the issues out there at the moment relating to terrorism financing. We've seen a lot of commentary about the threat of North Korea. North Korea is not just a threat in relation to its ballistic and nuclear missiles; North Korea sustains its efforts in this sphere, and does end runs around sanctions regimes, largely by being a regime of criminal transactions. The nation is effectively a mafia fiefdom. The Strategic Studies Institute includes narcotic trafficking and counterfeiting of United States currency in that activity, as well as many other issues, such as blackmail arms sales, the sales of its nuclear know-how—we know well its connections with Iran on that matter; I'll come back to that in a moment—and the sales of scud and other missiles to Hezbollah, Iran and Syria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are all important issues, but North Korea is focused on cryptocurrencies at the moment. There is a whole military enterprise set up to steal cryptocurrencies. They have an office called Office 39, which is a bureau that's dedicated largely to engaging in illicit economic activities. Every cog of the nation's machinery is mobilised to facilitate the regime's racketeering. Defectors have often described how there are schoolchildren working in poppy fields to help with the narcotics trade. Cash and smuggled goods are brought in on state owned merchant vessels. There was an issue that I was involved in where we were tracking a North Korean vessel off Australia's shores in this respect. This is a direct threat to us, a direct interest to us and a global and international issue. So we need a great deal of focus in relation to this legislation on how we tackle the crime bosses of North Korea. This is as important as any other measure that we take, particularly noting that it is defeating sanctions regimes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a great deal to learn in this respect from what Task Force Harpoon delivered in Israel's situation. They were obviously confronted with a significant threat from terrorism financing and went down this road very early in the piece. There were waves of suicide bombings in the late nineties and early 2000s. What was revealed in their detailed examination of terrorism financing was how it required so much money. Setting up suicide bombing regimes involves purchasing safe houses and vehicles, investing in the ability to construct suicide vests and explosive devices, and then there's an entire pensions regime to pay off the families of the suicide victims. So an entire regime was developed around these things. What transpired was massive amounts of money—hundreds of millions of dollars—being poured by Iran into Hezbollah and Hamas, associated too with Hezbollah's global criminal activities, it also being involved in narcotics dealings with Mexican syndicates and in Venezuela, and with money-laundering activities in West Africa. Hezbollah's global financial reach is just astronomical. Israel engaged in an extremely aggressive approach to dealing with that counter-terrorism financing. As I've often said privately in a lot of meetings, we could deal with terrorism through battalions of accountants as much as we deal with it through battalions of infantry and other kinetic operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That global picture of counter-terrorism financing is a very significant one. As we know, Iran is significant in that regard. Just recently, one of the global organisations that really focuses on this issue highlighted that Iran was actually in the top three of nations in the world for money laundering and counterterrorism financing. This is why I am disturbed somewhat by the government's approach to dealings with Iran. Earlier we heard a question posed about what the Labor government was doing in this space. Labor, when in government, not only rigorously applied the United Nations sanctions in relation to Iran but also introduced legislation on autonomous sanctions regimes. Under that legislation, we enabled Australia to engage in many levels of activity beyond what was contemplated in UN sanctions. In March of 2012, we produced a guidance note for advice to businesses and others that detailed what those countermeasures would entail in our autonomous sanctions and UN sanctions regimes, specifically in application to Iran. Special attention was given to business relationships and transactions with Iran, including Iranian companies and financial institutions, and countermeasures were applied to protect financial sectors from money laundering and terrorism-financing risks emanating from Iran. We put out a lot of warnings and engaged directly with businesses to make sure that they were aware of the details of the issues and risks and threats that were presented by the way that Iran conducted its business. This was an extensive financial operation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've seen in the legislation and the reports on where this needs to go, in relation to how correspondent banks deal with the transactions associated with financial distribution and flow of activity around the world, those banks are obviously a key means by which actual currency transactions take place—the central one of those currencies, of course, being that of the United States, because so much of foreign currency revolves around the US currency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it was litigation operations established during that wave of suicide bombing that really helped bring to the surface the involvement of banks that involved themselves in arm's-length processes in this—the Arab Bank, the Lebanese Canadian Bank and others. AMEX was approached and dealt with in some legislation as a correspondent bank. So, a lot of progress was made in that litigation to highlight that problem and to also hold those institutions accountable and pay the financial penalty for being involved. Labor introduced that autonomous sanctions regime and fleshed that out with specific targeting of Iranian interests and activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I'm disturbed about is that the current government has bent over backwards in recent times to really develop a relationship with Iran that is quite unhealthy. Of course, the world has been moving away from the UN-related sanctions on Iran in relation to its nuclear activity, but not completely. And of course the United States maintains quite a degree of sanctions that relate to Iranian activities in this field of terrorism support. So, it's a shame that the current government has moved away from those provisions and from the autonomous sanctions provisions that we had in place. This is really concerning when we see ministers like the trade minister planning to open an office in Tehran and encouraging Australian businesses to get involved there as an opportunity. In fact, a quote from him is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There's a significant opportunity for Australian trade to Iran, now that the sanctions have been removed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd encourage the government to take a closer, harder look at the way Iran operates as one of the top three nations in the world. It was highlighted by the Basel Anti-Money Laundering Index in 2016 as the highest money-laundering risk out of 149 countries surveyed by the Basel index.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I think the government has dropped the ball in relation to Iran. Obviously I understand why this was the case. They were bending over backwards to try to win Iran's support for taking Iranian asylum seekers. And of course we saw the foreign minister over there trying to curry favour, trying to get them in the door to coalition meetings in relation to activities in Iraq, which was rejected by the other coalition partners. And it was all for nothing. There was absolutely no way Iran was ever going to take asylum seekers back from Australia in those circumstances, so they were really stringing the foreign minister along. The foreign minister was engaging in activities and allowing agency activities in relation to Iran that we shouldn't have been involved in. I won't say any more on that, but it's deeply disturbing, the degree to which the foreign minister was taking us down this road of this closer relationship with Iran and the way in which this government is watering down the counterterrorism financing legislative arrangements in relation to Iran.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would encourage the government to re-examine this. Our own financial institutions have flagged that it is really difficult for them to actually work out how to work with Iran. For example, Cassandra Winzenried, senior economist at Efic, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Iran's external and fiscal situation makes it relatively non-risky but the payments experience has not been tested and there are some large problems with the banking system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a problem that our institutions have with confidence in dealing with Iran in relation to those issues because of the relationship it has with terrorism financing in particular. I'd encourage the government to get off its political bandwagon on these issues of China and actually focus on practical measures to fix the terrorism threat that this nation faces.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="E0J" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEENAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Counter-Terrorism</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  I thank all honourable members who have contributed to the debate regarding the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2017, which will strengthen protections against Australian businesses being misused for money laundering or the financing of terrorism. The bill will update Australia's AML/CTF regime to close a regulatory gap that has arisen with the emergence of digital currencies. Digital currencies are growing in popularity in Australia as a method of payments for goods and services and transferring value in the Australian economy, yet to date they have operated largely outside the regulated financial system. In doing so, the bill will also reinforce legitimate use of digital currencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is also pleased to be able to provide industry with some regulatory relief by simplifying and streamlining regulatory requirements. The bill deregulates two sectors, recognising the lower money-laundering and terrorism financing risks associated with them. Deregulating cash-in-transit operators will provide savings of approximately $326 million over the next 10 years, and deregulating some insurance intermediaries and general insurance providers will provide savings of over $500,000 over the same period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also improves and streamlines the operation of the correspondent banking provisions under the AML/CTF Act and better aligns with current international banking practice. The bill also enhances the ability of related corporate bodies to share information within corporate groups about the money laundering and terrorism risks associated with shared customers. This change will better reflect the way businesses actually structure themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cross-border movement of physical currency and bearer negotiable instruments, such as traveller's cheques, is a known money-laundering and terrorism financing method. The bill contains enhanced search and seizure powers for police and Customs officers that will strengthen their ability to enforce reporting obligations and to take appropriate action where there is suspicion of money laundering and terrorism financing. The introduction of civil penalties for some offences related to the cross-border movement of physical currency and bearer negotiable instruments will provide law enforcement with greater flexibility to respond in a proportionate manner to these offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of amendments in the bill will strengthen the important role of AUSTRAC as Australia's anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing regulator and financial intelligence unit. The bill will update the powers and functions of the AUSTRAC CEO to better reflect and support the full range of work performed by AUSTRAC. These changes recognise the growing role for AUSTRAC in supporting international efforts to combat and disrupt money laundering, terrorism financing and other serious crimes. Introducing the power for the AUSTRAC CEO to issue remedial directions to require regulated businesses to retrospectively rectify contraventions of a civil penalty provision will help address financial intelligence gaps created by a failure to report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also strengthen the AUSTRAC CEO's powers to supervise the registration of remitters to assist in addressing the higher risk posed by this sector. The new power to cancel the registration of a person who is no longer conducting remittance activities will ensure that dormant registration certificates are not used by third parties to avoid AUSTRAC scrutiny. Infringement notices under the AML/CTF Act provide a flexible and responsive option to encourage greater compliance with the act, reducing costs for both businesses and AUSTRAC. The bill extends the use of an infringement notice beyond the current six regulatory offences to an additional 11 minor regulatory offences. The bill will also make a number of additional amendments to the AML/CTF Act. The AUSTRAC CEO will only grant exemptions that could have an effect on money-laundering or terrorism financing risk where such a risk is low. The bill also expands the objects of the AML/CTF Act to reflect the domestic objectives of the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee tabled its report on the provisions of this bill on 16 October. The committee recommended that the government consider clarifying certain definitions in the bill through amendments either to the bill or to the explanatory memorandum. The government has carefully considered the findings in the committee report. The government amendments to this bill clarify the definition of stored value cards and the treatment of certain betting instruments under the AML/CTF Act. These amendments will ensure that betting products such as slips and vouchers are captured under the AML/CTF regime but not as stored value cards. This is consistent with the treatment of gaming chips and tokens under the AML/CTF Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's recommendation also asked the government to consider whether the terms 'article' and 'in the course of carrying on a business' should be clarified. While the government appreciates that these matters are complex and that some submitters raised issues of uncertainty, the government does not consider that additional amendments to this bill are necessary. Further amendments may have the unintended consequence of introducing additional uncertainty for stakeholders that could result in inconsistency with existing provisions of the AML/CTF Act. The bill has been drafted to provide flexibility and to future-proof the act. I'd like to thank the committee for its work in considering this bill. The committee's report recognises that submitters were generally positive about the provisions of the bill and that the bill would bring about an improvement in the operation of the AML/CTF Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is the first phase of what will be comprehensive reforms to Australia's AML/CTF Act to make sure that the regulatory framework that we have established remains effective against the evolving threats of money laundering, the financing of terrorism and other serious financial offences. Legislation is only part of the answer, and efforts to protect Australia's financial system from serious crime require the support of the private sector. The government will continue to work closely with all affected industry sectors to ensure that this bill and Australia's AML/CTF regime continue to effectively achieve that goal.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've just foreshadowed in my summing-up speech, these amendments give effect to the recommendation of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, and I thank them again for their report in relation to this bill. The committee recommended that the government consider whether the terms 'stored value card', 'article' and 'in the course of carrying on a business' could be clarified with a view to addressing some uncertainty expressed by some submitters to the inquiry. Following further consultations with stakeholders, the government determined that there is some uncertainty in relation to the proposed definition of 'stored value card' in the bill—specifically, whether certain types of betting vouchers are captured. For the purposes of clarity and certainty, government amendments have been prepared that rectify this issue. The bill will be amended to provide a definition of 'betting instrument' which includes betting vouchers; amend the designated services in table 3 in section 6 of the AML/CTF Act to explicitly capture betting instruments; and exclude betting instruments from the definition of 'stored value card'. These amendments will ensure that betting instruments such as slips and vouchers are regulated under Australia's AML/CTF regime but not as stored value cards. This is consistent with the treatment of gaming chips and tokens under the regime. The government does not consider that additional amendments are necessary. Further amendments may unintentionally introduce additional uncertainty and could result in inconsistency with the existing provisions of the AML/CTF Act. The bill has been drafted to provide flexibility and to futureproof the act.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  I rise to speak briefly on the amendments that have been proposed for the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2017, which concern the definition of 'stored value cards'. Stored value cards such as gift cards and travel cards are increasingly being used by criminals to launder money and finance terrorism. These cards have been used by cybercriminals to defraud Australians, by foreign fighters to fund terrorist activities abroad, and even by terrorists to finance aspects of the Paris attacks that occurred in November 2015. This year AUSTRAC released its first risk assessment of stored value cards, and in that document it warned:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the hardening of the banking and remittance sectors against criminal misuse … may increase the risk that SVCs will be used for terrorism financing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm pleased that there's been an amendment to the bill that looks at some of these areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned, though, at the minister's attempt to link this to the committee's report, because anyone who has read the committee's report would see that, although it noted some issues around stored value cards, the amendments that are being proposed in the Chamber right now have nothing to do with that recommendation. The Law Council Australia made a submission to the Senate inquiry asking that the bill provide greater clarity regarding stored value cards issued by financial institutions. That's not the amendment that is being moved by the government. We are happy to consider this amendment, but, like the bill more broadly, it frankly only tinkers with the edges on what is a very important and significant challenge which faces our country in our fight against terrorism. The amendment and this bill will not have a significant impact on Australia's ongoing issues with money laundering or terrorism financing. Like much of what we see from the government in this space, it makes a big noise about the things it is trying to do on terrorism but, when it comes to the policy and the legislation, they are just not up to the job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reiterate what I said in my second reading speech. Labor stands very willing and very eager to work with the government on what are very significant reforms that are acknowledged around the globe need to be made to the regime. This bill doesn't even come close to addressing those matters, and we are waiting for activity and leadership from this government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="231027" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TAYLOR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  I'm grateful to be able to speak today on this condolence motion to honour Wal Fife, an enduringly successful former federal member for Hume who had a penchant for people and a knack for numbers. If Wal had written a book on grassroots politics, it would have been a bestseller. No doubt, an entire chapter would have been devoted to the art of village visits—advice he so kindly shared with me when I was a candidate, which I readily absorbed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wherever Wagga Wagga went, Wal went. In 1984 he squared off against prominent National Party member Stephen Lusher and a tough Labor candidate for the newly redistributed Hume, which had taken in Wagga. At that stage, Wal had previously been the member for Farrer. Wal was always a gentleman, a man of the people who had time for a yarn. His great friend and adviser and a former Yass Liberal Branch President, Dr Jonathan Williams, recounted to me that Wal's village visits probably swung that election in 1984 in Wal's favour. 'One has to look beyond the Cootamundra dinners,' Wal always used to say. He put that to great effect in 1984, turning up to Wee Jasper, a very small town just outside of Yass that I used to represent, a place Lusher hadn't visited for years. In a few moments, Wal had completely wooed 44 Wee Jasper locals, winning their hearts, minds and approval at the ballot box.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wal was a statesman of consequence and a mentor of mentors. I like to think that there are many of us in the House today, including myself, benefitting greatly from his legacy. He was the major influence on my predecessor and mentor, the late Alby Schultz, who went on to become the longest serving member for Hume since Federation. 'Wal Fife is the reason I went into politics,' Alby said when he announced his retirement in 2012. 'He guided and nurtured me and is still giving me advice.' Alby, in the same way, guided and nurtured me as a candidate in my early days as the member for Hume. Very much in the Wal Fife mode, Alby would remind me where I came from, to be honest and to make time for people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Williams always says that Wal was an absolutely outstanding constituency MP. He would dictate to his secretary, Mrs Nugent, constituent replies, notes of personal thanks, birthday cards and vote-winning strategies for particular towns and villages while driving the car from one end of the electorate to the other, which would take, in those days, most of the day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alby Schultz's wife, Glo, who remains a very local and close friend, said to me of Wal: 'There was no-one else in politics who carried out their job with more respect for protocol. He was a statesman in every sense of the word.' When Alby contested the seat of Burrinjuck in 1988, Glo recalled Wal being always encouraging and guiding: 'But that didn't stop him from having a quiet word to me on occasion about protocol—about what I should say and what I shouldn't. He was strong on things like that but always warm and encouraging.' Glo says that Wal also used to have a saying—that politics is like a wheel, but the trick was to keep moving forward. He was always making progress in the right direction. Former Deputy PM Tim Fischer, the former member for Farrer, said that Wal had masterminded the establishment of Charles Sturt University. He had worked closely with Dr Cliff Blake, the then vice-chancellor of the Riverina-Murray Institute of Higher Education, to bring the multicampus university into existence. We all see the enormous benefit of that today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over a federal parliamentary career spanning 17 years, Wal would serve only the first 18 months on the backbench before his elevation to the Fraser ministry as the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. He would go on to serve as the Minister for Education from December 1979 to May 1982 and as the Minister for Aviation from May 1982 until the defeat of the government in 1983. He also served three stints as minister assisting the Prime Minister, twice in the area of federal affairs and then, from 1980 to 1983, as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters. He would have marked 70 years as a member of the Liberal Party in January 2018, and 14 December will mark 60 years since he won the state seat of Wagga Wagga. He not only put his life into the Liberal Party; it was his life. Just hours before he died, he was told that he was to be made a life member of the Liberal Party in recognition of his service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My thoughts and the electorate of Hume's thoughts are with his wife, Marcia; with their children, David, Allan, Carolyn and Susan; and with their 10 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. I offer my deepest condolences to them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation" style="font-weight:bold;">):</span>  I share the sentiments and eloquent words of the member for Hume about Wal Fife, a great friend of both of ours and a great friend of our regions. I stand here today sharing a unique bond with the late Wallace Clyde Fife. We are, and were, the only two Wagga Wagga born men to represent the city in the House of Representatives in the federal parliament. I can recall contesting a very robust three-cornered contest in 2010, in which the late Wal Fife, the late Alby Schultz and the late Joe Schipp were all very keen to see the Liberal candidate running for the seat of Riverina succeed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up in a household in which Wal Fife was revered—absolutely revered! My late father, Lance, and my mother, Eileen, thought Wal Fife was the best politician that could ever be hoped for. Indeed, he was. As the member for Hume just pointed out, he was a mentor to all of us. He was the reason that many of us embarked on a political career. Even Kay Hull, the former member for Riverina before me, remarked just what a mentor Wal Fife was for her. Of course, Kay and I are both National Party members and very proud of it. I appreciate the member for Hume is a Liberal, and, let me tell you, Wal Fife was a very, very proud Liberal, and so he should be!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After winning the seat, in 2010—as I said, it was a rather vigorous contest—it took me a little while to summon up the courage, but I thought I should go out and get anointed, as it were, by Wal Fife, because, as I say, he was a very special friend of my family. His farm, Gundary Pastoral Company, at Harefield near Wallacetown, was not far from Brampton, Brucedale, just nine miles out of Wagga, near Junee, on the Olympic Highway, where I grew up. And so it was that on 11 August 2011 I drove out to Gundary for morning tea with the Fifes. Marcia greeted me at the door and ushered me into the study, and there was Wal holding court with all the papers around him. He'd suffered a stroke some time prior to that but, I tell you what, he hadn't lost any of his wit or memory. Even though it had been a long time since he'd graced the frontbench of the House of Representatives, he went through each of the frontbench Liberal and National Party members one by one and absolutely summed them up, and, dare I say—for our Labor friends here—some of the Labor people too. He knew absolutely everything about the parliament. It was, of course, the hung parliament that we had between 2010 and 2013, and Wal knew everything about it. It was great that, over a cup of tea, a scone and a sandwich, he did anoint me and said he was very pleased. He knew my family, so he thought I'd be okay. From time to time I sought Wal's advice, and from time to time we would run into one another at functions. He was always very gracious, and I know that I had Wal's respect—as, of course, he had my lifelong respect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another link between Mr Fife and me. After serving 18 months on the backbench after being elected to federal parliament in December 1975, Mr Fife was appointed Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, two ministries that I now hold portfolio responsibility for. I'm Australia's 17th Minister for Small Business since 1988 and I share Mr Fife's dedication and, indeed, his lifelong interest in protecting consumers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wal Fife, as the member for Hume pointed out, was born on 2 October 1929. He was the son of William Clyde Fife, an agricultural produce merchant, and Myrtle Elizabeth Wyatt. He was born into a family committed to public service. His father served as an alderman on Wagga Wagga city council, and upon his death Wal's older brother, Harold, was elected to council and went on to serve as deputy mayor—and a fine deputy mayor and historian he was, too. Harold Fife also served as president of the Wagga Wagga sub-branch of the Returned &amp; Services League and was made a life member of that sub-branch. Harold died in 2011, aged 92.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wal was educated at South Wagga Public School, Wagga Wagga Public School and Canberra Grammar School. He loved writing letters to politicians. In 1945 he wrote a letter to Winston Churchill after Churchill lost office. He said: 'I started off the letter by saying I was a 16-year-old Australian schoolboy, one of the many Australians who would like to thank him for his services during the war years. I made the point that it must have been a regret to him that, so close to the end of the struggle, the British people had cast him aside.' Churchill replied, thanking him for his kind message and saying he had read the letter with great pleasure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1947, Wal wrote to opposition leader Robert Menzies seeking a position in the Liberal Party of Australia's federal secretariat. A year later he was appointed clerk and received a congratulatory letter from Menzies. He didn't stay long in that role. In 1949 he joined the family business, Fifes Produce, but he did not stay idle in public life. He was active in the Wagga Wagga and Albury political scenes. Wal wrote in his book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Wal Fife: a country Liberal</span>—required reading, I think, for every federal parliamentarian: 'In the late 1940s the Liberal Party was still only a fledgling organisation and it was quite unusual for a person my age living in the country to join it. Furthermore, my father was vice-president'—here you go, Member for Hume, you're going to love this—'of the Wagga Wagga branch of the then Country Party.' So Wal had a little bit of Country Party/National Party blood in his veins. He said: 'Everyone, including the president, expected I would join the Country Party. Instead, I joined the Liberals, and I joined it for very good reasons.' He talks about the leadership that was required to form a strong government. He said that he felt it was a party for all Australians, regardless of whether they lived in the city or the country. I know that was espoused by the late great Alby Schultz as well. Mind you, he had great things to say about my friend the member for Hume here, and certainly I know the member for Hume is following in Alby's footsteps as far as being a great Liberal Party member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wal goes on to say, 'In 1948, I joined the Liberal Party and in doing so changed the course of political history in Wagga Wagga.' Indeed he did. He served as member for Wagga Wagga in the New South Wales parliament from 14 December 1957 to 15 October 1975—17 years, 10 months and two days. Quite remarkable service. He served as Assistant Minister for Education, Minister for Mines, Minister for Conservation, Minister for Power, Assistant Treasurer, Acting Minister for Transport as well as Minister for Highways. When appointed Minister for Education in 1965 he was 35, and at the time he was the youngest minister ever appointed in New South Wales. He resigned as member for Wagga on 15 October 1975 to contest the federal election in the seat of Farrer. He was elected to federal parliament on 13 December 1975. It was a red-letter day for the federal parliament. He served on the backbench for 18 months before being appointed Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in the Fraser ministry. He went on to serve as Minister for Education.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  Nearly a year ago a 64-centimetre blood clot almost killed my healthy 20-year-old daughter, Elanor, after she was prescribed an old and dangerous drug, Diane-35, also marketed under names like Brenda-35 and Juliet-35. This drug has never been approved for use in the USA and was actually banned in Europe in 2013 after too many women died from blood clots, and it was only reintroduced with tough restrictions. Yet it's routinely prescribed to Australian women without proper warnings, education or consideration of safer, modern alternatives. Since first talking publicly of our experience I've been deluged with horror stories of life-threatening or fatal blood clots by families from across Australia. I've also researched the issues and met with health regulatory authorities and professional bodies. I have no hesitation in saying there are women in Australia who needlessly die or are harmed by this drug.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our case, in January we were staying with family friends in Kandy, Sri Lanka. I got back from an early morning walk and Elanor was lying on her bed and she said, 'Dad, my leg pain's worse and I think I have a deep vein thrombosis and need to go to a hospital.' I said, 'Darling, that's a bit dramatic for 9 am, have you had breakfast?' She said 'No Dad, look, my leg's swollen, I can't pull my foot up and the calf pain is worse.' Luckily she recognised the classic DVT symptoms as she works at a medical clinic and helps with ultrasounds. The first hospital we went to just wanted to ice it and bandage it as a sprain, so I commandeered a car to drive three hours to Colombo, where Elanor was diagnosed with a life-threatening DVT and hospitalised for a week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We made it home a fortnight later and she's had a harrowing year of daily blood thinners, blood tests every few days, stockings, ultrasounds and medical appointments galore. The clot slowly shrank but stubbornly would not clear. After resigning herself to the advice that the residual clot may be with her for life she stopped the blood thinners six weeks ago, and thought she'd do one more scan for luck. Miraculously this last scan showed the clot appears to have cleared—although she still has swelling, intermittent pain and vein damage, potentially lifelong, and one hell of a beige leg stocking. She'll never be able to take oestrogen-based medication again, she struggles to get some types of insurance and any future pregnancy will be high risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So why did Elanor's DVT happen? The medical consensus is it happened because three factors combined. First, her doctor prescribed her Diane-35, which heightens the risk of blood clots in women. This drug is only registered in Australia by the TGA for two indications—idiopathic hirsutism or signs of androgyny, really where other drugs have failed. Yet unknown thousands of Australian women are prescribed it 'off-list' or 'off-label' because a side effect of this drug is it's an effective contraceptive even though it's not registered in Australia for this purpose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The TGA wrote to me making clear that off-label prescriptions are not endorsed by the TGA. Yet everyone knows this drug is widely prescribed as a sexy-sounding first-choice contraceptive. Elanor's doctor wanted her to take a contraceptive pill to regulate her irregular periods, but she was never advised it was an off-label prescription, warned that the risk of blood clots on this old-style drug is 1½ to three times higher than more modern, safer alternatives, or educated about the signs to look out for. The risks are heightened in the first three months of taking it, like most medications. The second factor was that, after starting this drug, she took long-haul flights. Astoundingly, the same doctor did her overseas travel vaccinations, even though the drug's fine print says not to take it on long flights. Third, Elanor also had a fairly common genetic variation that increased the risk of blood clots. Around one in 20 Caucasian women have the Factor V Leiden gene, but there's no routine testing in Australia, even when women are prescribed old-fashioned, riskier drugs like Diane-35. The doctor prescribed Elanor this drug without knowing she had a fairly common genetic variation and then hopping on a plane almost killed her. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The important question now is: what needs to be done to reduce the risk to other Australian women of being hurt? I've had productive discussions through the year with the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the Pharmacy Guild, the Royal Australian College of GPs, the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, the National Prescribing Service, and law firms expert in medical negligence and regulation, and I plan to meet with medical insurers. It is clear to me that we need to improve Australia's overall pharmacovigilance regime, or, in plain English, our drug safety systems that minimise harm. Importantly, we need to overhaul systems in this country in relation to off-label prescribing, because the risks of adverse effects are heightened when a drug is prescribed for a purpose other than that for which it is approved by the TGA. The system should ensure that Australian pharmacists are always made aware when a prescription is off label and also if a drug is being prescribed to a patient for the first time. That way, the pharmacists can engage with patients to ensure greater awareness and acceptance of the risks and possible side effects, which is an extra and potentially life-saving check in the system—which some countries have, but we do not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to Diane-35, if this drug is to remain in Australia at all, then much tighter controls over it are needed. The reality is that, despite this drug not being approved as a contraceptive in Australia, doctors and pharmacists think of it as one. It's listed under 'contraceptives' in the pharmacy manuals and it's stored with them. Everyone I've spoken to has admitted privately that this drug is a problem. Two of the executives I met at one of the regulatory agencies told me in frustration that these pills are known as sleepover pills. I said, 'Why's that?' They said, 'They're named after a girl you had stay over as if they're your friend, but they are not.' A refreshingly direct statement came from my meeting with Dr Bastian Seidel, President of the Royal Australian College of GPs. He told me he doesn't think Diane-35 should be available in Australia anymore. He wisely observed that the real issue is that this is an old drug, but we don't delist legacy drugs in Australia, even when there are newer and safer alternatives. Drug companies can withstand or fight off the odd lawsuit and still make money. So a mechanism to delist or restrict such legacy drugs is a policy issue that governments should look at. But that won't happen quickly, so more immediate action is needed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that, since I raised this issue, work is underway to improve education and awareness amongst doctors, pharmacists and consumers. In response to a letter from the TGA after my meeting, the National Prescribing Service is now working to raise awareness amongst practitioners of the risk of blood clots from drugs like Diane-35. The NPS is also scoping a consumer awareness campaign for social media to raise awareness of the risks and safer alternatives. This is important, because one of the issues driving the prescription of Diane-35 is the consumer pressure on doctors. My daughter saw this on social media chat groups, where some young women think this is a good pill because 'it makes your skin nice'. Well, there's not much use in having nice skin if you're dead from a blood clot! The Pharmacy Guild and the PSA have committed to updated professional education modules on women's health in light of Elanor's case. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, more research and data is needed to understand this problem. There's strong evidence that this drug is prescribed far too widely in Australia. Everyone knows it; everyone admits it. But there is no reliable way of knowing how widespread this danger is, because data isn't collected in Australia about off-label use if it's not on the PBS. This should change. The NPS are interrogating their data now to try and identify patterns in the proportion of prescriptions that are likely to be for contraception. But, without system changes, it's likely that only the drug companies know how big this problem is, and they have no incentive to tell. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, there is a clear need for tougher restrictions and warnings, so I will write again to the TGA, requesting tighter restrictions through scheduling of this drug, either by requiring a formal authority for GPs to prescribe it, which should be available only after a Factor V Leiden blood test is performed and negatived; or, if this isn't possible, its availability should be restricted in future so that only certain specialists, such an endocrinologists, can prescribe it, and only after ruling out genetic blood disorders. To support this, blood testing for genetic risks such as Factor V Leiden should be available on the Medicare Benefits Schedule. I will also write to the Minister for Health asking him to encourage applications and quickly agree to any recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Product warnings are also important. In 2016, Australia's Advisory Committee on the Safety of Medicines conducted a full review of combined oral contraceptives in light of this drug being banned in Europe because it was killing women. It recommended the harmonisation of product information statements, amongst other things. Shamefully, the only pharmaceutical company that has refused to make the recommended changes is Bayer, which manufactures Diane-35. The TGA, however, has the power to require warnings on the packaging of drugs in Australia. I will call on the TGA to require a warning be added to Diane-35 and all generics that says in big bold letters, 'This drug is not approved as a contraceptive in Australia', which will help to influence consumer and prescriber behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being stuck in the ICU in a foreign country was a traumatic experience for my daughter. The doctors and the medical staff in Sri Lanka were fantastic, but we did have to take RID into the ICU so she didn't get dengue fever from the mosquitoes. It certainly wasn't a comfortable experience, but she eventually made it home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I dearly and sincerely hope that my daughter's experience, and the steps I've outlined, will reduce the risk of other Australian women suffering life-threatening blood clots. I thank all of the professional bodies that I mentioned—the TGA, the Royal Australian College of GPs, the National Prescribing Service and the pharmacists—and also my colleagues, the member for Macarthur, who's a practising paediatrician, and the member for Dobell, who's a pharmacist, for helping me undertake this research. Finally, I thank everyone involved who has spoken up about their family experiences. I hope we can do better.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:41</span>):  December is a time of reflection, and 2017 has been a magnificent year in Chisholm. I'm so pleased to recount the many successes of our wonderful community here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chisholm is an iconically multicultural community. Regardless of our cultural heritage or ethnicity, Australians across Chisholm are united by a shared belief in the important values of freedom, family and enterprise. The Chisholm community represents the best of liberalism, respecting and upholding our freedom to celebrate different cultures in this great country we call home. It's about upholding religious freedoms and the individual enterprise, which is so evident every day and always throughout the Chisholm community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day in Chisholm, over a hundred different languages other than English are spoken in our community and families and friends regularly gather to celebrate their unique cultures and traditions. Throughout the year, I have been honoured to represent our Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, at myriad cultural celebrations. I loved joining Chisholm's substantial Chinese and Taiwanese communities at the colourful and vibrant Box Hill Chinese New Year and Moon Festivals, the Telugu Association of Australia for their 25th anniversary celebrations, attending the 20th anniversary of the Taiwanese School of Melbourne, the welcome dinner for Chinese star Yang Liping and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Under Siege</span> review cast, a celebration of the 106th year of the Republic of China Buddha's Light International Association of Victoria, Fo Guang Shan Melbourne's Buddha's Day and Multicultural Festival known as Vesak Day, the 33rd Annual Theofania—the Blessing of the Waters—the Oakleigh Glendi Festival, the Lonsdale Street Greek Festival and the Diwali celebrations, to name just a few. My sincere congratulations to community leaders who ensure that these important celebrations and traditions are passed down through generations of Australians of migrant and varied cultural heritage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our nation has been vastly enriched by faiths of every tradition, each contributing its own unique and special thread to the multicultural fabric of our society. Perhaps the greatest celebration of our culture and heritage is on Australia Day, where Chisholm residents and Australians nationally gather together and celebrate the myriad attributes which make our society so rich and so vibrant. On Australia Day, and at wonderful times throughout the year, I was thrilled to attend citizenship ceremonies run by the Whitehorse City Council and the City of Monash where hundreds of Chisholm residents proudly became citizens of Australia, the world's most successful multicultural nation. With diversity comes a richness and vibrancy that is something to be treasured and celebrated. Australia Day is a traditional day for all Australians, especially given that one of the things we subliminally celebrate is our freedom to enjoy our cultures, traditions and a merger of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By far the best part of my role as the member for Chisholm is the amazing people I meet every day who make a difference to our local and broader community. If I were asked to name one thing that makes me proud to be Australian it would be the volunteering spirit and the fact that Australians across the board always help those in need. The Chisholm community is strengthened and enriched by the many hardworking people who dedicate countless hours to our local sporting clubs, neighbourhood houses, social groups and other fantastic organisations. In June I held the inaugural annual Chisholm Volunteer Awards night, at which we had the honour of a very special guest, the Hon. Julie Bishop, who joined me in naming Mr Trevor Eddy as the 2017 Chisholm Volunteer of the Year and in giving many well-deserved awards to the volunteers. Having the Minister for Foreign Affairs take the time to attend and to give these awards with me is a testament to how truly appreciative the Turnbull government is of the thousands of Australians who contribute and volunteer their own time. Forty-two recipients and their friends and families all gathered at Crossway in Burwood in celebration of Chisholm's rich volunteer culture, and our foreign minister warmly welcomed them and gave them their prizes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the year I have enjoyed visiting and being visited by a plethora of community groups, including the Box Hill Lions, U3A Box Hill, Rotary clubs from across Chisholm, Oakleigh-Carnegie RSL, Box Hill RSL, Clayton RSL, Neighbourhood Watch, Neighbourhood Houses and Centres, community information services, Eastern Volunteers, Burke &amp; Beyond, Melbourne Eastern Residents Association, Alkira, Migrant Stitches and Crossway Lifecare. Our volunteers are the threads that hold together our communities, and I know I speak on behalf of all Chisholm residents when I sincerely thank all of those who dedicate countless hours to the betterment of our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the year, Chisholm's schools, universities and TAFE were abuzz with a love of learning and education. Throughout the year I had the pleasure and honour of attending many local schools to award school leadership badges and certificates. I've gone from honouring new school leaders at the commencement of the year to looking forward to attending graduation ceremonies in coming weeks. Some key school based events this year included hosting our foreign minister, Julie Bishop, at Avila College in Mount Waverley, presenting at the Presbyterian Ladies College Participating in Politics program and representing the Prime Minister at the Day for Daniel—Daniel Morcombe—at St Mary Magdalen's primary school in Chadstone, as well as visiting many other local primary and secondary schools. I also was very happy to welcome a number of Chisholm schools, including Mount Waverley Secondary College, Orchard Grove Primary School, Christ Our Holy Redeemer, Huntingtower School, Mount Waverley North Primary School, Mont Albert Primary School, Mount Scopus Memorial College and Ashwood School to our parliament when they visited Canberra. I was also thrilled to visit Box Hill Institute with the Minister for Employment, Michaelia Cash, to discuss how Box Hill TAFE is a fantastic provider of the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Monash and Deakin universities continue to provide world-class tertiary education for students from Chisholm and beyond. This year I was pleased to visit fantastic research centres, such as the Monash University Food Innovation Centre, the Monash Health Translation Precinct and the new Monash University diabetes research laboratory, as well as to see the manifestation of integral research at Deakin's ALLPlay dance program. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull visited Monash University with me, and it was the first time a prime minister had visited Monash University, Australia's largest university, since 1989.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be part of the Turnbull government, as we have backed and supported many local clubs, including many clubs that have worked hard to ensure the active participation of young girls and women in sport. Providing equal opportunity for women to participate in sports often translates into their leadership attributes and experience in other spheres, such as business and community life. For future generations of women in leadership, leadership in sport translates to leadership and equality in business and the community, and it is integral to continuing the great Australian tradition of sport participation for future generations. Clubs such as the Box Hill Hawks, Surrey Park Junior Football Club, the Box Hill United Pythagoras Soccer Club and Waverley Hockey Club are actively looking forward to the future by including women's participation in sport, and I am proud to say that many Chisholm sporting clubs continue to expand and include girls at all levels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to announce that, also in round 3 of the Stronger Communities Program, Harlequin Rugby Club, Nunawading Basketball Association, Kerrimuir United Cricket Club, Nunawading City Soccer Club, Eastern Lions Soccer Club, Ashwood Sports Club, Mount Waverley City Soccer Club, North Box Hill Tennis Club and Box Hill United Pythagoras Soccer Club were all successful in their applications for grants, with a particular focus on backing girls in sport and providing appropriate infrastructure to best facilitate their participation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Australia Day and on the Queen's Birthday, some extremely worthwhile individuals who live and work in Chisholm were acknowledged as part of our nation's honours system. I acknowledged them at the time but wish to again highlight their integral contributions to our community. On Australia Day, Mrs Rosemary Brown, Mr Keith Irvine, Mr Alexander Hehr, Mr Bernard Millane, Professor the Hon. Nahum Mushin, Professor Evan Simpson, Professor Jane den Hollander, Mr Christopher Thorn and Mr Michael Wells were recognised for their invaluable work in our community. On the Queen's Birthday, Mr Paul Bonsak; and Mr Norman Fettell, known as Rex, were also recognised as wonderful Australian citizens who contribute to our society and live in Chisholm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Representing the electorate of Chisholm is a great honour. As my speech tonight is testament to, our community is so rich and diverse. I'm amazed everyday by the many wonderful elements of our community and am so grateful to represent them in this place. I'm particularly proud to reflect on a fantastic year in Chisholm during this week in parliament, a week where members and senators have gathered to legislate for marriage equality. I was personally thrilled and over the moon when 61.6 per cent of Chisholm residents voted yes in support of the marriage bill, and I am proud to vote yes in this place as their representative. This year, 2017, has been an extremely busy and productive one, and I look forward to the year to come.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="129164" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:51</span>): Recently, Airservices Australia changed the flight paths into Hobart Airport in a way that directly impacts rural communities in the south of my electorate. For the people on Forestier Peninsula, which is about 50 kilometres north of Port Arthur, the first they knew about this change was when they were woken up at 3 am by freight planes overhead, flying low on their descent. This isn't a nimby issue. The people of Dunalley, Murdunna, Bream Creek and other affected communities know that flight paths have to go somewhere. This is an issue of appalling consultation and of impacts that could have been avoided with a little more forethought and care by the authorities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My home in Penna has had planes flying overhead for years on their way to the airport, but they're high overhead and hardly noticeable unless you're looking up. That is very different to what now faces people on the peninsula—very loud aircraft at all hours of the night and day, as there is no curfew in Hobart, and an impact that is only set to get worse as the airport gets busier and as it prepares to accept bigger jets, including from China.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The communities affected have not previously been under flight paths. They are quiet, rural communities that are recovering from the devastation of the 2013 bushfires, and they are developing agritourism ventures with wine, oysters and accommodation. Being under new, noisy flight paths is hardly what they bargained for, and they had no idea it was coming. If the new flight paths are necessary to improve safety, and that has been the claim from Airservices Australia, then so be it—except no evidence has been presented that these changes are necessary and, certainly, no evidence has been presented that safety on the former routes was ever an issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has emerged through a lot of tortuous discussion that the so-called safety benefit of the new route is simply this: less communication is required between the tower and the pilot on approach. Airservices argue that this lessens the risk of human error. Essentially, on the new routes, once the plane gets into the formal and narrower flight-path route, it is essentially 'set and forget' from the tower's point of view. But no-one, as far as I have been able to discover, has ever argued that the old system was a potential risk—not the pilots association, not the air traffic controllers association, not the unions, not the airport. This seems to be about streamlining processes. That's a laudable goal, to streamline your processes and make them more efficient, but given the price to be paid by people on the peninsula, the people of my electorate, I do not think this change meets the cost-benefit test. And community consultation has been farcical. There were no ads in the newspaper, no community forums, no flyers and no liaison with me or the member for Franklin, or with Tasmanian senators of any party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many authorities, Airservices Australia makes it difficult to speak to a real human being, and that's been a matter of considerable frustration to Dunalley residents like David Patman who were badly impacted by the changed routes and who simply wanted to express their concerns and get more information. David contacted me and together we managed to get through to a real person, and as a first step we strongly encouraged Airservices Australia to run a community forum in Dunalley, actually getting to the community and talking to people on the ground; listening to the community, explaining why the changes were necessary, taking on board their concerns and having a go at developing acceptable alternatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, David and the community kept the pressure on, with petitions, and contacted Minister Chester's office. The preference from the community and my preference is to ask for the old routes to be reinstated while the efficacy of new routes can be examined. But that has not occurred. We are pleased that Airservices finally agreed to a community forum, but I was very disappointed when I saw it was to be held at 11 am on 11 November. Some mad scrambling, after we explained the difficulty with such a time clashing with Remembrance Day services, resulted in the forum being reset to 11.15 am. Despite that awkward time and lack of notice, more than 70 locals from Dunalley and surrounds turned out. Instead of it being a public meeting, residents were carved off into small groups in private rooms to have the changes explained to them—the old divide-and-conquer rule. Despite the good faith on display from residents, it was clear that the exercise was what I feared it might become—a tick-a-box consultation: 'We've had the consultation; tick that box.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Airservices did propose an alternative new route at that forum, and despite many concerns raised by residents about the impact of the suggested new route that's what Airservices came up with some weeks later, saying, 'Oh, well, we've consulted the community and here's the route.' Lo and behold, that's exactly what they've presented. Other alternatives that affected fewer residents were ignored, with no explanation given as to why they were not explored further. Airservices had simply made up their mind. It defies belief that with the vast tracts of unoccupied land and water on the southern approaches to Hobart Airport a more suitable path affecting fewer residents could not have been found. This new route may be convenient for Airservices Australia, but it will continue to have devastating impacts on residents and tourism businesses on the peninsula. It will also have significant and unknown opportunity costs. Can the area still transform itself post-bushfire as an agritourism centre? Will investors be interested in risking their money on boutique ventures when passenger and freight jets fly low overhead?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have informed Airservices Australia of my deep disappointment with their handling of this issue, and I will continue to work with the community to press for an outcome that meets the needs of both a growing airport and the local community. The ball is now clearly in the court of transport minister Chester. He can choose to either stand up for regional communities or continue to sit on his hands while Airservices Australia run roughshod over the folk of my electorate. The Nationals like to put on the big hats and act like they're working in the interests of country people. Well, Minister Chester, here's your chance. Here's your chance to work in the interests of people in rural communities. Tell Airservices Australia to revert to the old flight paths and order a proper consultation process for the development of new routes, if they are required, which take into account the likely impacts on rural communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the two minutes I have left, I'll talk about the NBN in Lachlan, in the Derwent Valley. There's a wireless tower there which NBN Co has agreed needs an upgrade. The town of Lachlan has 300 people in it and they're all connected to the wireless tower, and it's oversubscribed. Basically, more people are trying to use that tower than should be. At peak hour, it can get as slow as one or two megabits per second. That is essentially so slow that people like Luke Cashion, who contacted my office, cannot even run a speed test on it. Luke's organised a petition of the Lachlan community. In just a few days, he's organised 45 signatures. He is not the only one affected by this. Schoolkids home from school, people working from home and others simply cannot use the internet in the afternoons at peak time. That's not good enough. The NBN has agreed it's not good enough, and an upgrade is on its way. The NBN says, 'You can wait till the second half of 2018.' They are expecting residents of my electorate, the residents of Lachlan, to wait at least six months—probably more like 12 months—before they get around to upgrading the wireless tower at Lachlan. That's simply not good enough. Minister Fifield really should get involved. He is another minister who sits on his hands, waits for advice from his advisers and does nothing other than what he is told—an absolutely hopeless minister. Get that tower upgraded now. We know that, under the coalition, the NBN has become second rate. We know it's slow. We know it's not fit for purpose. At the very least, you can fix it for the people of Lachlan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:01</span>):  I haven't got lots of grievances; I've got lots of things to celebrate. At the moment, we are harvesting across the Wimmera Mallee. The harvest is a good time. It's a time when, frankly, people receive the benefits of their soil, water, sun and sweat; you combine those things together and produce food. There's something very noble about agricultural production. It's a pleasure to speak in front of you, Mr Deputy Speaker Coulton, because you know something of this. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BROAD:</span>
                  </a>  I cannot understand the complete rudeness in this chamber when I'm talking about something that's not controversial. It shows the character of the people sitting on the other side, when they can't even listen when I'm simply talking about food. I am amazed by the character of this person, because I've always treated her very decently. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I talk about the harvest. People go out there and do a lot of hard work. When you see the bunkers when you're driving along, you look at them and think about what a blessed country we are and how blessed we are to have the people who are out there putting in that hard work. A lot of the sowing of the crops across the Wimmera Mallee is now done dry. Because of the seasons, and we don't get those big opening rains, people put those crops in, spending up to $300,000 or $400,000 of their own money sowing fertiliser and seed into dust. They are sowing in hope, and this year they're reaping the reward. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government plays a key role in this. Whilst we've got to harvest the crops, we have to get the crops from the paddocks to our arterial roads. The federal government is putting $20 million a year into Roads to Recovery. Roads to Recovery was an initiative of John Anderson, a former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. It was said that the best expenditure of money was to give it to the local councils so they could upgrade local roads. Of course, a B-double can weigh in excess of 60 tonnes. They have to be able to get down over those culverts, over those dirt roads, so they can get to our arterial roads. The federal government has put more money into those federal roads in the electorate of Mallee: the Calder Highway, the Western Highway and the Sturt Highway. I'm pleased to see the upgrading that's taking place there—upgrading that needs to happen. The challenge for us is that, when we think of roads, we tend to highlight those that have large traffic loads rather than those that roads that may not have the high traffic loads but are critical to our economy. If we produce something and can't get it to the market, then all Australians are the poorer for it. You may not have huge numbers of trucks like you have on a busy freeway in Melbourne, but the product that goes on those trucks is of economic benefit to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also invested in rail. Darren Chester, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, was excited to announce $240 million to build the Murray Basin Rail Project. That is upgrading and standardising rail in my patch. Did you know that Mildura to Melbourne is the busiest freight rail link in Victoria? Now we'll be able to take trains with 24-hour turnaround, high-value horticulture and up to 150 shipping containers per train. Each of those shipping containers can have in excess of $80,000 worth of table grapes. I took Michael Sukkar, the assistant minister, to have a look at it last week, and he was amazed, frankly, at the amount of product coming out of our area, the prices they were getting and the confidence. Everywhere we went, they were talking about expansion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That expansion has been able to be achieved only because of the free trade agreements with China, Japan and Korea that were signed by Andrew Robb. Those boxes are scanned, packed in containers and sold before they even leave Wakefield Transport, then sent down to the Port of Melbourne and shipped across to China, Korea or Japan. We haven't talked enough in this place about the one thing that has driven economic growth in our patch: those free trade agreements, opening up those markets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no point having markets if you can't grow the stuff. The other thing that the federal government has done is invest in water infrastructure. Water is the lifeblood of agriculture, and it's something that our side of politics clearly understands and that side of politics doesn't. When Senator Wong was the water minister, she put through a policy which said that, if a farmer wanted to get out of farming and sell their bit of water, they had to pull up their water infrastructure, sell that water to the Commonwealth and not use that block for production for five years. It was diabolical. Essentially the government bailed out someone who wanted to leave, and put the cost of production, the cost of water, onto the person who wanted to stay, making them wear double the costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, we came in and put $103 million of federal money into upgrading irrigation infrastructure, granted tax deductibility status if you wanted to make irrigation upgrades on your own farm and also allowed for $20,000 instant tax write-offs. Fortunately, it is now five years since Senator Wong was the water minister, and those blocks are coming back into full production. They're getting the tresses and wires in, the vines are being planted, and the water infrastructure is being rebuilt. Senator Wong is the least popular politician to have ever walked the streets of Mildura, because we are still cleaning up the legacy of her mismanagement after five years. It shows the contrast: her vision was that the place was dead and dusted, and they were going to shut it down; our vision is, 'We're going to open markets, put common sense back into water policy and make the place boom.' Mr Deputy Speaker, you've had the great privilege of visiting the wonderful town of Mildura, and I think you can confirm just how much enthusiasm there is and that it is a booming place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have built 11 NBN towers around the outskirts of the town, which has been our doing, and that has put telecommunications there. We've also just recently upgraded the runway so that a customer from China can fly on a Chinese coded airline—incidentally, Virgin is now Chinese coded—directly to Melbourne and take the 737 to Mildura, Chinese coded all the way, have a look at the products they're going to buy, experience the community and place their order. Those products are then making their way to other parts of the world. It has been a real jigsaw, a piecing together to drive productivity, and it's been a result of the decisions we've made—decisions about roads to recovery, delivered by the National Party; decisions about rail, delivered by the National Party. It is the biggest investment in freight rail in Victoria's history, delivered by the National Party and the federal government under Darren Chester.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's investment in roads. The federal government has put $20 million into the Western Highway and the Calder Highway. It has been the free trade agreements that have opened up those markets. It has been the investment in irrigation infrastructure, with $103 million as well as getting the economic settings right after that investment in irrigation infrastructure. And it has been the investment in runways and telecommunications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that has been the sleeper—that probably isn't seen as an investment but is clearly an important part of government—is getting stability back in the water market. People talk about managing our water better. The one way you take away confidence is to say to the Australian people, the Australian irrigators, 'We're going to take away your water; you are managing it badly. We need to send it down to South Australia. We need to keep the river mouth open. You are to blame.' And someone says, 'I was going to put a centre pivot into my farm. I was going to put some new technology on my farm. I'm not going to do that now, because I may not have water.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have put stability back in the water market. The Deputy Speaker's son was a key person in that advisory role. It has incentivised people to say, 'There is a future for me. It is worth putting in new irrigation infrastructure. There is a future for our town. It is worth spending the money to put a centre pivot in.' It's about getting the policy settings right: free trade agreements, infrastructure and water policy. Those are the things that, when you piece it together, deliver a great country and wealth, and when we get that wealth we have the capacity to build the society we want. It all starts in regional Australia, and it all starts with good decisions by this government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263328" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HUSAR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:12</span>):  I have a lot of grievances on behalf of my constituents. Given the time of the year it is and that people are more festively focused than they are on things that aren't working, I decided to take a different approach to this speech. I am continually impressed by the strength of my community and the decent hardworking people I represent and get to call my neighbours. I can't say it enough but we do have the best people living in my electorate. I don't want to do this with hubris but I would like to go through some of our achievements, tinged with some of the things this government might like to do better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year in Lindsay, as with most electorates, we welcomed new citizens. But we now see that the citizenship application process has been delayed somewhat by the immigration and border protection minister, with his ridiculous policies around a level 6 English test, among other things. Our Lions Club has celebrated its 60th anniversary and I would like to acknowledge the club president, Steven Holley, and thank him for the club's continued support of our community. They are stepping into the void and filling things in our community and doing projects that ordinarily a government might handle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In March, at my International Women's Day awards, we launched a shelter for women and children who are victims of domestic and family violence. That shelter is being looked after by a team of volunteers. It will be staffed by experts when we come to opening it. Of course, this is something where governments could intervene and not take away funding. It has been ripped out of that sector and put into normal bulk homelessness housing rather than specialist homelessness services for victims of domestic violence. We celebrated International Women's Day at our Penrith Women's Health Centre, and I'd like to make mention of the incredible work being done by everybody there. Ninety per cent of their work is in domestic violence. It would be great to see the government jump on board and provide certainty around funding. I'm not talking about the federal government, I'm talking about Stuart Ayres and the Liberals in New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We opened a new water park for a community that sees 45 degrees in summer. It's a pretty phenomenal achievement, having that for our community. We've had a groundbreaking ceremony for a new retirement village. The private sector, of course, was called in to help look after our aged because there are no housing options for them. The Nepean Men's Shed has opened, and we have the biggest men's shed, per square metre, in the whole of the country—or at least we did back when we opened it. And I'd like to say thankyou to Tony Hudson, the secretary, for his dedication in getting it up and running.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And through the hard-fought campaign of most of my community we saw that our Nepean hospital finally got a boost to the amount of funding that it will receive; $550 million will be coming into that hospital. But, again, we should be getting about $1 billion, when you compare it with what other Sydney hospitals were given. And given that it won't meet our current demand, let alone our future demand, it is another short-sighted decision by the Liberals in New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fantastic students at Werrington County, Werrington Public, Cambridge Park and Cambridge Park High School, along with our deadly dancers, had a great performance earlier this year. And Grace Brinkley, the president of the Penrith seniors and pensioners club, has been really supportive of me and my work across the electorate this year. We opened a new school for a specific purpose over at Glenmore Park, and Fernhill has been operating for a year now, with Julie Raciborska at the helm leading that school. I was incredibly proud to attend their very first awards ceremony last week, before coming down here, and to see the joy on the students' faces. How far they've come this year is an incredible achievement, and congratulations to Julie on that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been appointed as patron of the Nepean Family History Society, which has been a great joy to me. We have a volunteer group of people in our community who are adamant about researching all the family histories of every member of our community. NAIDOC Week was celebrated. We've run over eight mock parliament sessions in local schools, and the PCYC has overseen its upgrading and reopening of the club. Our Nepean Football Association registered 12,500 players, many of whom are just from my community. Western Sydney University successfully supported students in their learning but now, sadly, face a cut of $98 million, which is the highest cut of any university in New South Wales and the second-highest cut anywhere in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you were in an electorate like mine, in Western Sydney, with some of the pressures faced by ordinary families, you would see that cutting $98 million to that university is the dumbest decision ever made by almost any government. The M4 toll was reintroduced by the Liberals in New South Wales. They congratulate themselves on making commuters in my electorate pay another $2½ thousand per year just to get to and from work. At the same time, they actually managed to completely ruin the train timetable. Now about 15 minutes has been added, give or take, to the commuters' journeys. So, you can get on a train and take about an extra half an hour per day for your return trip, or you can get on the M4 and pay a toll—which was already paid for and which we removed, and then they put it back on. But it is not just for the term or life of that road being paid for; it'll go for about 40-something years. I think I'll potentially be at retirement age, provided that this government doesn't keep boosting that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in my community have been interested in what's been happening, and we've been able to offer a number of forums over the last year. We could have had even more going on if we'd had a Labor government, because a Labor government would have actually invested in my community, not continued to rip the guts out of it. And who knows when the election might be called in 2018? Hopefully it'll be sooner rather than later—not that I look forward to facing another election campaign, although this time I'll do it on two legs and not one. But we would have seen investment with a Labor government in Western Sydney, and in Lindsay in particular.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many, many forums have been attended by the wonderful members of our community who are interested in what's happening in aged care. Julie Collins came out to visit us. We launched the Lindsay Awards—the first time we've actually recognised and supported the work of the phenomenal women in my community and what they've been up to. We had an education forum with Tanya Plibersek and Jihad Dib, the member for Lakemba, and an urgent meeting on the education cuts that saw $17 billion cut out of our primary school and secondary schools. Chris Bowen came out to meet with our local businesses, and I got to welcome 80 new babies to our community, which is probably one of the biggest highlights of my year so far. The Australian Jobs Taskforce visited and heard from our community about the things that are lacking. At the same time we had Doug Cameron visit, for the Western Sydney Apprenticeship and Traineeship Expo. The Medicare task force, headed by Sharon Claydon and Mike Freelander, was attended. We had about 25 doctors from our own community come along and give evidence about the appalling conditions they are stuck working in, which is an absolute blight on this government. There was also the housing forum, with Senator Doug Cameron, to discuss the issues around affordable housing, and climate change and energy, with Mark Butler and Adam Searle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are talking about climate change and energy, people in my community faced 20 days of over-33-degree heat in February of this year. We reach phenomenal temperatures on an extended basis, so energy prices are incredibly important—not only that but getting something done about climate change and renewable energy is very much on our minds, especially with the new solar energy provider that has just opened in our electorate. We'll be one of the only ones to be able to sell the new Tesla batteries that are going to be available for homeowners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently we had an NBN forum which someone renamed the 'No blooming internet forum'. That was the pet name for the forum because people cannot actually connect to the NBN or, when they do, it is incredibly slow. Chris Bowen and Amanda Rishworth came out to celebrate our veterans. We also had a childcare roundtable to talk about the accessibility issues for early childhood education. Those accessibility issues go to people with children with a disability who can't afford reliable early childhood education or after-school and out-of-hours care. That is not meeting the needs of vulnerable families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Lindsay care about our community and their investment in our local community. They want to see some action. They don't want to see it stagnate. All they see is an out-of-touch Prime Minister. They want to see more local jobs and not 83 per cent of our community having to commute over an hour every single day in one direction just to get to their place of employment. They hear a lot about the '30-minute city' and being able to get to jobs and education, but then they see a government that does the opposite, which is cut money for a local university. I have been out at the train stations, at the mobile offices, at 'Coffee with a Pollie' and at the forums to let people know that I'm there. We've received and addressed more than 1,200 representations for our local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm here, I would like to thank my hardworking staff—Jane Shelton, Lara Greenhill, Catherine Sargent, Angela Hadchiti and Phoebe Fuller—for the incredible work they have done in the Lindsay electorate office this year and will continue to do into the new year. I look forward to the election next year, when we can, hopefully, get a Labor government and deliver for the people of Lindsay.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HYM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IRONS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:22</span>):  I will take this brief opportunity to note one grievance, but, like my colleague who was here previously, the member for Mallee, I will be talking about some positive aspects of things that have happened within the community as well. I just wanted to remind my electorate about the issue with power prices in Western Australia. At the last state election, which the Liberal Party lost to the Labor Party, one of the issues that was raised heavily was the sale of Western Power. The Labor Party vehemently opposed it because they said it would raise power prices. The Labor Party won the election, and so, obviously, Western Power wasn't sold. But one of the first acts of the Labor Party was to put up power prices by 10.9 per cent, which flew in the face of their campaign that said, 'Don't sell Western Power because prices will go up.' But it's the old story with Labor: don't listen to what they say; watch what they actually do. That is what Western Australians and all the people of my electorate now have to suffer—an extra 10.9 per cent in power prices under the state Labor government. Mark McGowan, who opposed the sale, introduced that as one of his first acts in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I wanted to remind my electorate is that we've got the stadium opening soon. It, again, was developed by the Liberal Party. At the launch in 2010, the now state Treasurer Ben Wyatt was there, turning the sod with Colin Barnett and all happy about it. But in 2013, at the state election, Mark McGowan and Ben Wyatt, the local Victoria Park member, opposed the stadium. They said, 'If we get elected, we will not build this stadium.' What's happening now is that they're part of the state government and they are having their photos taken everywhere, launching the opening of the stadium. That is going to happen next week. They want to take all the credit for something they actually opposed back in 2013 and said they would not build if they got elected. Again, don't listen to what Labor say; watch what actually they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker Coulton, the rest of my speech will be of deep interest to you. I recently had the Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources visit my electorate. One of the things we did was launch a new office. It was a combination of the Perth NRM and the WA Farmers Federation. They have joined together to occupy an office in my electorate on the Great Eastern Highway. I look forward to the symbiotic relationship they will have working together. It was a very positive morning with a lot of people excited about the prospect of those two not only sharing an office but working together. Then Minister Hartsuyker and I attended the local IGA store in Preston Street and we did some promotion of the country of origin labelling, which I'm sure you might have done in your own electorate as well, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was great to do that and meet people and present them with information about the country of origin labelling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With that country of origin labelling, the reforms commenced on 1 July 2016 with a two-year transition period to allow businesses time to comply with the new arrangements. The transition period ends on 30 June 2018. Under the reforms, the labels for most food that is grown, produced or made in Australia must include a logo—a kangaroo and a triangle symbol—as well as a bar chart and, where appropriate, a text statement to show the proportion of Australian ingredients. More information on the Country of Origin labelling reforms is provided on websites, and a range of COOL examples are also provided on some of the websites, which I will name at the end of my speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The instore demonstration provided consumers with information about the new COOL reforms and showed them the range of examples what the new labels look like and where they can find more information. We handed out some notepads, which had the details on the back, to some of the people who were shopping in the store. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, after extensive consultation with industry and consumers, the new reforms came into effect on 1 July, and these reforms provide consumers with clearer and more consistent information about how much of their food is actually Australian. As I said, the reforms: include a two-year transition period; replace the current requirements in the Australia and New Zealand Food Standards Code with a new mandatory information statement created under Australian Consumer Law; close a loophole that allowed some food to be labelled as 'packaged in' without indicating where it was grown or made; simplify claims by clarifying what 'substantial transformation' means; and remove the complex 50 per cent local production cost test to reduce regulatory burden across all industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, food that can currently be sold without an origin label will continue to not need a label. This includes food sold for immediate consumption or made and sold on the premises in places such as restaurants, cafes and bakeries, and also at the farm gate, which would hold a deep interest for you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To support industry, the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science has developed a range of business support initiatives for these reforms, and they are available at foodlabels.industry.gov.au and business.gov.au/foodlabels. In addition, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has developed a suite of educational material for businesses at accc.gov.au/business/advertising-promoting-your-business/country-of-origin-claims. I welcome these reforms. The country of origin label is important, not only for our farmers but for consumers to know where their food and products are actually coming from.</span>
