                  </a>  Yes, I do. It's about this issue of wearing artefacts into the chamber. We've been pulled up on scarves, coats, hats and all sorts of things. The Greens are wearing badges that have '$75' on them. I personally don't believe any of them are worth $75, but, nonetheless, I think that they ought to be told to remove them, otherwise we'll set a precedent. I've got plenty of stuff I want to wear in here if that's the case.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  Before I come back with a formal ruling, we have previously prohibited the wearing of a jersey or a shirt that had a senator's name on it by, I believe, the mining industry. We have not finally settled upon what badges are allowed or what paraphernalia is allowed. We know that slogans on shirts are not allowed. I was going to start with the principle that any badge wider than a lapel is probably going to be inappropriate, and that would facilitate people wearing ribbons, as I know they do for certain notable days. Before I come back with a ruling, I will ask senators with badges that are wider than about an inch or two to take them off to be consistent with past rulings. Otherwise, I'll come back to the chamber with a ruling. I am trying to be reasonable to facilitate people wearing ribbons on special days and for commemorative events but at the same time be consistent, because, if those badges were on a T-shirt, I would suggest that they would not be allowed in the chamber. Senator Whish-Wilson, are you rising on a point of order?</span>

Can I just, with a touch of seriousness, note that the Senate operates on the basis of a degree of comity amongst colleagues. The slogan on the shirt that was ruled out of order in the past that had someone's name and an industry on it was smaller than that badge. I note Senator Di Natale has a small badge, which I wouldn't consider to be out of order, consistent with my view of ribbons and the like. I ask senators who are wearing the large ones to take them off. I'll come back to the chamber with a formal ruling. I'll check the precedent on it. I thank senators for assisting with that. I trust that suffices on the point of order.</span>

We know that this government can't be trusted to bring on legislation. We know that they can't be trusted not to leak documents to the media. They can't be trusted to keep their word. We've become accustomed to a government that says one thing and does another. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are here to ensure that this parliament ends discrimination once and for all in our schools and in educational settings. We don't think it's acceptable in any area of the community. We don't believe there's any place for a school to tell a young person who may be gay or lesbian or struggling with their sexuality or gender identity that they're not welcome. We don't think there's any place for a school to tell a teacher who might be in a same-sex relationship, 'We don't think we can offer you a place in our school.' That's not what a country that supports every member of its community does. That's not what a country that recognises that that form of discrimination should be consigned to the 1950s does.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now is the time when we should be able to work across party lines, with the Labor Party and the crossbench, to actually deliver legislation that will end discrimination once and for all. The Prime Minister came out and said he doesn't support religious schools being able to expel students based on their sexuality. That was a welcome announcement. I note that he was silent on the issue of teachers. The Leader of the Opposition also came out and said that he'll work to ensure that no child is denied human dignity. Well, here's your opportunity to ensure that every child—indeed, every person in this country—is afforded human dignity and that no child is expelled simply on the basis of their sexuality or gender identity. We have an opportunity now to protect young people and to protect teachers so that they continue in their learning environment or in their employment without the fear of being expelled simply because of who they are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the message this sends to young people right across our community in the wake of that hateful and divisive plebiscite is: 'The way you feel is wrong. You as a person are not valued. There's something wrong with you.' We as a nation shouldn't stand for that. We should never accept that. We should be striving to end discrimination in all its forms wherever it is. That's why we are very proud to introduce a bill that says to every single child and teacher in the country: 'We stand with you. We value you. We love you for who you are.' Yet, what we have in this place so far are two parties who made hollow promises only a few short weeks ago and won't back it up with legislation.</span>

If you support ending discrimination towards students and teachers, support this suspension motion so that we can debate the bill. It's no good to go out in front of the cameras and mouth empty words. Those words aren't given the force of law. That's what we're debating here right now: whether we will give every child and every teacher in Australia the comfort to know that they will be respected and loved and treated equally simply because of who they are, not because of some outdated legislation that sends a message—not just to them but to all people—that somehow the way they feel is wrong, or different. So I say to all of you in this chamber: support this suspension.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  Just on a month ago, the Australian public learnt that religious schools could expel lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender children and fire LGBTQ-plus teachers and other staff members simply on the basis of who they are, simply on the basis of their sexuality or their gender identity. And they were horrified. An opinion poll showed that 74 per cent of voters oppose these laws that allow religious schools to select students and teachers on the basis of their sexual orientation, their gender identity or their relationship status. So, it is urgent that we continue to debate and, in fact, to vote on our private senator's bill to remove these discriminations today. Even the Prime Minister admits that removing discrimination against students is urgent. Last month he said that we need to act now. Well, we can act, and we must. People have suffered for too long. We can pass this bill through the Senate today. Our amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act to remove these discriminations are simple and straightforward, and the Australian community and the LGBTIQ community will celebrate when they are passed. Right now these exemptions to Australia's antidiscrimination laws serve only to harm and to threaten LGBTQ people who attend or work at religious schools or who wish to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday I launched a call for LGBTQ-plus people who are attending or working at religious schools or who did so in the past to share their stories with us, and the stories have started to flow in. I received a letter yesterday from someone who has asked that they remain anonymous. They said: 'For weeks I and many like me have been nervously watching the headlines wondering what, if any, changes will be made to the Sex Discrimination Act. Why do I care? Because I'm a teacher at a Christian school, and I'm gay. I go to work each day eager to impart knowledge on my pupils, but each day I am terrified. Currently, if my employers found out that I was in a same-sex relationship, they could legally fire me. I know you're wondering why I don't just leave and teach at a school where I am welcome. At the end of the day I am still a Christian and I want to be here. My Christianity is a choice; my sexuality is not. Some people, including my own father, have said, "Just keep your head down and pretend you're single." Just imagine for a minute that the people you are with nine hours a day, five days a week, do not know that the person you love even exists.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have fought for years to change our laws and end this damaging discrimination. Our bill removes exemptions for students, teachers and staff members at religious schools and protects them not just on the basis of their sexuality but on the basis of their gender identity, because trans and gender-diverse people have hardly been mentioned in the public debate other than the very identity of trans students being under constant attack, including during the current Victorian election campaign. Trans and gender-diverse students, along with lesbian and gay students, must not be able to be expelled, and staff members must not be able to be fired.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the Wentworth by-election, the Labor Party said that they supported ending this discrimination towards students and teachers and the Prime Minister committed to stopping religious schools from expelling LGBTQ students before the end of October, but so far nothing has changed. The Prime Minister missed his self-imposed deadline, and we are worried that instead of working with the Greens to end this discrimination now the Labor Party wants to delay action, potentially until after the next election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week marks one year since the marriage equality postal survey results came in with a resounding yes vote showing that the majority of Australians supported removing discrimination in our marriage laws and making marriage equality a reality. Let us mark this momentous anniversary by taking another step forward in our fight to remove discrimination and to have equality for LGBTIQ Australians. Let's end this discrimination in our laws and in our schools, once and for all. I call on all senators in this place to support this motion and to support the Greens bill today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  I rise to indicate that the Labor Party will not be supporting the Greens in respect of this matter today and to reject the comments by Senator Rice about the Labor Party's position in respect of this matter. The matter arose, of course, in the lead-up to the Wentworth by-election, where individuals sought to release sections of the so-called Ruddock report into religious freedoms. There was speculation about what the contents of that report said, and, in particular, sections of that report were leaked to the media. As a result of that, there was significant debate in the lead-up to the Wentworth by-election about the responses of the various political parties to that report. I think it's very clear that, in relation to the first of those so-called leaks, the Labor Party, the Liberals and the Greens all made it very clear that they didn't support discrimination against LGBTI students in religious schools and that those current discrimination provisions that are in the law should be removed as a matter of priority. It's the removal of that discrimination that continues to be the priority of the Labor Party, and that's what we are focused on. We don't believe, especially in the lead-up to the Victorian elections next week, that the Greens should be playing games with such an important issue as discrimination against LGBTI students. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has made it absolutely clear that we will work co-operatively with the government, as we like to do on so many occasions, and with everyone in this place to remove discrimination against students as a matter of priority. While Labor is also committed to removing discrimination against staff, I note that many of the religious schools that this current provision, as an exemption to the Sex Discrimination Act, applies to say that they do not use these provisions. But we recognise that there is an obligation, especially on the Labor Party, to consult further with the schools about a change to this legislation and the best way to achieve the result that we all want—that is, a discrimination-free society and, in particular, a discrimination-free society in religious schools. That's why we're seeking to progress this matter through the appropriate course, which we believe is a review by a committee. Labor's inquiry will progress the issue of discrimination against students by examining the government's proposed bill, and we are proposing that that should be done as a matter of priority. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party does want to get this done by the end of the year, and we do note that the government had also indicated, especially in relation to the situation in regard to students, that they also wanted to get this legislation through the parliament. I do note that Christmas is heading towards us like a steam train at the moment and there are only a limited number of days left to deal with this issue. We are committed to removing discrimination against staff. We are going to examine the issue as part of our inquiry. What's become very clear is that the issue is complex and there will be some consequential amendments to other legislation required, but we've got a process to sensibly work through this issue to get the result that we seek, which is an end to these discriminatory clauses in the Sex Discrimination Act.</span>

Firstly, the government of course will not be supporting this suspension motion. We think it's important that we get on with the important business of the government—namely, to legislate the government's plan to deliver a fairer share of the GST to Western Australia in a way that leaves every other state in Australia better off. That is an important item of business that the Senate should be dealing with forthwith. But, given some of the statements that have been made by Senator Rice and now also by Senator Farrell, I thought I would again put on the record that, as the Prime Minister announced some weeks ago, the government is committed to moving amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to ensure no student of a non-state school can be expelled on the basis of their sexuality. We did engage in consultations with the opposition, through the shadow Attorney-General, to reach a relevant consensus in relation to these matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I advised the chamber on behalf of the Prime Minister during the last sitting fortnight, subject to agreement between the government and the opposition in relation to our proposed amendments, we would be in a position to introduce those amendments as soon as possible during the most recent sitting fortnight. The government stands ready. But the Labor Party has not been prepared to come onboard with the very sensible amendments, consistent with what the Prime Minister has publicly indicated we would do. We remain available, in the first instance, where there is broad consensus, to make improvements to the relevant legislation. We can have a longer conversation in relation to the matters where there is a diversity of views. That is the government's position. We encourage all senators of goodwill to come together and move forward in relation to the areas of reform where there is a broad consensus—namely, ensuring that no student of a non-state school can be expelled on the basis of their sexuality—and then we will leave other matters for the broader processes that have been flagged by others.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BERNARDI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:22</span>):  I congratulate both the opposition and the government in their rejection of this attempt to hijack this place to pursue another element of the Greens' extreme agenda. The Greens, of course, are a party where hypocrisy is not unknown, because they stand to be the defenders of the marginalised and yet they marginalise many people and they refuse to deal with some of the serious, egregious breaches of public trust within their own ranks. As a point, Senator Farrell mentioned the Victorian election campaign in his response, and the Greens have someone who, on their Facebook page, endorses shoplifting as a legitimate pastime—one of their candidates. And, importantly, today it was revealed the Greens also have a person who has an alter ego as a rapper and, in his rap contributions, decides it's okay to drug women and rape them and violently abuse them. It is an appalling, shameful indictment on the selection of this motley bunch of Green zealots.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why should we think that this might just be a single aberration? It's not, because the former senator Lee Rhiannon—may she return to this place, because her replacement is far, far worse—belled the cat on the abuse, the pawing and the sexual harassment that is endemic in the New South Wales Greens, which Senator Di Natale and his crew refuse to deal with. They come in here all pious, defending the marginalised, and yet they will not stand up to the freaks and the creeps in their own ranks who are molesting women in New South Wales. There are complaints and you're refusing to deal with them. But why would we expect anything different from you, Senator McKim? Why would we expect that? We know exactly what has been going on, because Senator Lee Rhiannon has published it. Senator Rhiannon, your former colleague, the one that you marginalised because she was prepared to speak up against your freaky, outrageous agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You come in here and you try to hijack the agenda that the Australian people want dealt with. They want to see the GST fixed. They want to see you concentrate on the important issues. If you want to go through the contributions from those on the Greens, on every single occasion it's about finding some ism, some failure or some victim in this country. We've had enough of it. The Australian people have had enough of it. Get on with mainstream things. We need to protect people's jobs. We need to arrest the debt and deficit. How many times have the Greens spoken about debt and deficit in this place? Next to none, is my suggestion. The only thing they talk about is how everyone's apparently racist. Everyone's apparently racist in this country. Everyone's a bigot. Everyone's some sort of ism or some foe. Yet we know that the sexual harassers lurk within the New South Wales Greens party. We also know that they endorse people who say—or rap or sing or whatever it is they want to call it—it's okay to drug women and sexually abuse them. They defend that and say: 'Oh, it was just a song. It was done in their youth.' Well, that doesn't cut the mustard. Anyone who thinks it's okay to say, 'Yes, we should be drugging women and raping them or abusing them'—or whatever they say in their rap lyrics—is on another planet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people have had a gutful of the Greens and their freaky agenda. The Australian people want this parliament to concentrate on things that are important to them. It is about building stronger families. It is about making sure our economy is better. It's about lowering taxes. It is about easing the cost of living. It is about providing practical, sensible and commonsense solutions to the ills that have failed to be dealt with because this place has been controlled by a bunch of people who are completely outside the mainstream. We can't allow this to happen anymore. I congratulate the major parties today for rejecting the extreme agenda of the Greens, which is trying to manifest itself by hijacking the business of this Senate again and again and again. Not only will they not deal with the issues confronting the Australian people; they refuse to deal with the issues that are endemic within their own party. They are a closed shop of misogynists, heterophobes and reverse bigots. They are the most disgraceful political party in the history of this country. Well done to the major parties for closing them down.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  I rise to oppose the suspension of standing orders. Labor believes that nobody should be discriminated against because of who they are or whom they love. It was the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who first called for action to address discrimination against LGBTI schoolchildren when the religious freedom report was leaked several weeks ago. Labor's sole focus since then has been to work constructively to pass a bill to remove unjust discrimination against LGBTI schoolchildren and staff. It is disappointing that the Morrison government broke its promise to remove discrimination against LGBTI school students in the last parliamentary sitting fortnight, but it is equally disappointing that the Greens political party is now trying to use this important issue as ammunition for a cheap political stunt designed to rescue its faltering election campaign in Victoria. That is why this suspension must be opposed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have an important message for the Greens and their leader, Senator Richard Di Natale: if you want to rescue your faltering Victorian election campaign, then you need to start with your shocking candidates. Just today, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> reported that Greens candidate for Footscray, Angus McAlpine, who goes by the pseudonym 'FatGut', is guilty of making vile homophobic and violently sexist slurs, and he even trivialised sexual assault. This Greens candidate has also reportedly joked about stealing a police car, ramraiding stores and being arrested for being drunk and disorderly. The Greens have refused to disendorse him. By allowing Angus McAlpine to continue to stand under the Greens banner, the Greens and their leader, Senator Di Natale, are telling voters in Victoria that they endorse his vile homophobic and violently sexist statements. Former Greens leader Bob Brown, may he rest in peace, would never tolerate sexism and homophobia—</span>

In politics and in life, if you have principles and values, they must be adhered to not when you want to but especially when those principles and values are inconvenient, embarrassing and expensive. Otherwise, they are not principles. Either you believe in feminism or you don't. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We are of the strong belief that the employment of a teacher is a matter based on merit and merit alone. We also do not support the discrimination of students on the basis of gender or sexuality. Nonetheless, the question being asked here is about whether the issue raised warrants the disruption of the orderly conduct of business in the Senate. We do not believe that the threshold has been met in this particular instance.</span>

He also reminded the Senate that the government stands ready to amend the Sex Discrimination Act, subject to reaching agreement with the opposition. If that's possible and he's not making any headway, I stand ready, along with the crossbench, to reach an outcome on your bill. That is my offer. I hope that the government is genuine and that the minister will take me up on it. I look forward to further discussion in regard to that.</span>

                  </a>  Mr President, I'm seeking your ruling. I'm hoping it will emulate the rulings of President Sibraa and President Reid, in which they said that the display of items such as badges with slogans in the chamber was inappropriate. I make the point that some of the Greens are wearing badges with $75 on them. I presume that's not how much Senator Di Natale paid his au pairs! I would ask you to rule them out of order, because it is clearly a political campaign.</span>

I made the observation before that the wearing of certain ribbons has not been prohibited in this chamber, whether they be in memoriam of certain events or commemorating or celebrating certain days. I did ask senators to take off badges that were larger than a lapel, consistent with rulings. I'll go back and check those rulings, but I have pondered this issue because to prohibit the wearing of any badge on a lapel other than a Senate badge would, I think, be too strict. I asked the senators involved—the Greens senators—and they did remove the larger badges. But I will check those rulings on the smaller badges that are being worn and that I can't read from here.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a general rule, if a badge can be identified by someone at the other end of the chamber I think it would be inappropriate—if it had words on it. But I do not want to prohibit police day ribbons, Anzac Day or Legacy badges or the like, and I don't think any senator would want me to. But I'll come back to the chamber with your request, Senator Bernardi.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:43</span>):  When I was speaking earlier on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018, I was recounting the history of the GST legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned that the GST was first introduced in 2000, but we know that Mr Howard, the former Prime Minister, indicated in 1995 that there was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… no way that a GST will ever be part of our policy. … Never, ever. It's dead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know that after he was elected, the Liberals changed their tune, with Mr Howard describing the GST in the year 2000 as 'something the country has needed for more than 20 years'. Of course, this issue goes to the heart of our concerns about this government's propensity to backflip on its promises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party has more form on changing its mind in relation to the GST. During the 2013 election campaign, Mr Abbott said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Let me be as categorical as I can, the GST will not change. Full stop. End of story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the GST simply can't change unless all of the states and territories agree …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And yet, here we are debating the coalition's changes to the GST that the states and territories have reservations about. A letter from the Treasurer of Queensland makes it quite clear that this is a unilateral change by the Commonwealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reservations that we have expressed stem partly from the fact that the new arrangements mean that, while states and territories not performing as well economically as the stronger of New South Wales or Victoria will be topped up, those who outperform the benchmark will keep their surplus funds. That means that there will need to be more money to distribute, hence the need for an injection of Commonwealth funds to the overall GST money pool. Other reservations of the states and territories centre on the ministerial discretion in decision-making written into this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are still questions to be answered by the coalition: Where is the money coming from? How will the new system address economic volatility? What is proposed after the seven-year guarantee that no state or territory will be worse off expires? What will the terms of reference be for the Productivity Commission review? Will the states and territories be guaranteed input into that process? These are questions that I hoped would be answered when the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, of which I'm the deputy chair, inquired into this bill last month. That committee received evidence from all states and territories, the Treasury, the Minerals Council of Australia, Rio Tinto, the Institute of Public Affairs, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia, and the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia through a public submission process and through our public hearing in Canberra. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was evidence, particularly from Western Australian business and resource groups, that the proposed change in distribution method would encourage states and territories to work harder to develop their own economies in order to retain a greater share of the benefits, if outperforming the benchmark state. There was evidence from other states and territories that the current system of HFE is adequate and not broken, and in some cases, as in the case of the South Australian submission, there was an argument that it should be retained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor senators made additional comments in that Senate inquiry report that echo the reservations that I've outlined to the Senate. We pointed out that, once again, the coalition dragged its feet on an important financial reform and, once again, it took Labor action, through announcing our policy, to get the government moving. It was Labor who announced that we would legislate a floor for GST relativities—action that was eventually copied by the Morrison government after they had said in July that 'there's no need to do that'. That was in the committee report. The flip-flopping marketing man, our new Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, soon recognised that Labor was right, just as we were right to fight for the no-state-worse-off guarantee to be enshrined in legislation—another element initially rejected by the Morrison government, with new Treasurer Frydenberg suggesting administration costs would be too high. I note from the report that Mr Frydenberg said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Because what some of the states are wanting us to do is to run two parallel systems. They're wanting us to run an old set of books based on what is the current system and a new set of books, which is based on the new system with the floor and the additional $9 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Based on that, the Treasurer had previously expressed his opposition to the no-state-worse-off guarantee. But it was only a week until Mr Frydenberg flip-flopped his way back to Labor's position—a position quite vocally shared by the states and territories. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's clear that only Labor can stand up for the states and territories when it comes to unfair coalition legislation. And we echo their call for transparency around the top-up funding and where that will come from. We want to know how this government, which is consistently big on headlines and thought bubbles and short on detail, intends to find the $9 billion that it is promising to top up the funding pool. Labor shares the real concerns of the states and territories about whether other funding sources will be cut to offset the Commonwealth contribution to the GST pool. That's why Labor senators recommended in our additional comments to the committee's report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the letter from the Federal Treasurer to the State and Territory Treasurers stating that 'any additional financial assistance referred to in the bill will not be offset or partially offset by a decrease in other grant funding to the states' be tabled during the Parliamentary debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm grateful Minister Cormann did provide that letter—I believe he tabled that yesterday. I see that we have a letter from the Treasurer to the Treasurer of Queensland. I just want to read into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> the very important commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I also confirm any additional financial assistance referred to in the bill will not be offset or partially offset by a decrease in other grant funding to the states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, that, I think, goes some way to addressing some of the concerns that we have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of the states and territories made reference to this letter in their evidence. In my home state of Queensland, the state government's submission said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Treasurer gave assurances in his letter to the Deputy Premier and during the second reading in Parliament that the updated system will not be to the detriment of other payments to states. However, this is not reflected in the Bill or the Explanatory Memorandum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">… … …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill (and Explanatory Memorandum) should be amended to require that pool top-up and additional financial assistance will not come at the expense of other payments to the states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take a minute or two to look at the Queensland government's submission. For Queenslanders, it highlights some of the concerns that we have. We know that Queensland has the most decentralised population of all the Australian states and is uniquely exposed to arbitrary changes to the GST system when we abandon the principle of full HFE. This is reflected in the Queensland government submission. The system that we've had has meant that Queensland has received less than its population share of GST revenue in some years and more than its share, depending on the economic circumstances. Queensland is particularly exposed in this matter because the GST revenue for Queensland in 2018-19 represents about one-quarter of the state's total revenue. We really need to get this issue right. The Queensland government submission said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Despite promises of consultation and opposition from states to proposed changes, the Morrison Government introduced the … bill in October 2018. The Bill will permanently change the system of distributing GST revenue … </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Palaszczuk government in its submission acknowledged that the government has taken, as I said, a unilateral decision to amend the legislation. The Queensland government does welcome the recent amendments to the bill, in particular the 'no state will be worse off' guarantee and the Productivity Commission inquiry, but there are still some concerns. The Queensland government made seven recommendations, which, I think, are all eminently sensible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that I was concerned about in relation to the revised GST arrangements is that under the government's preferred model, in the year 2023-24, Queensland was going to be the only state over the transition period that would be financially disadvantaged in comparison to the existing arrangements. During the course of the Senate hearing, I sought clarification from Treasury officials, and they made it very clear that the no-worse-off guarantee applies to individual years over the course of that transition period. Ms Phipps said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we would look at what the difference was between what a particular jurisdiction had got over the course of the previous years under the updated system. If, in the example Queensland gave, they were $100 million worse off in 2023-24, but, for example, were $80 million better off in the updated system across the years prior to that, then the top-up would be $20 million to make sure that, in that year, Queensland was cumulatively in the better of the two systems—was better off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been clarified that those top-up payments do occur within the transition period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We forgive the state and territories, particularly Queensland, for their cynicism or scepticism about this issue. My home state has been the victim of vicious coalition cuts at both the state and federal levels—devastating cuts to health and education. In most recent times, we've had the Newman government that sacked 14,000 workers, and we've seen cuts at a federal level to public hospitals and penalty rates, and there are less apprentices. We know that it's Labor that have done the hard yards on economic management. We've announced hundreds of policies in the lead-up to the federal election. Our policies are researched and they're costed. We're absolutely up-front about where the money's coming from with our election commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to conclude today by mentioning some of the points that the shadow Treasurer, Mr Bowen, has written about in an opinion piece. Mr Bowen has said, 'You can trust us with the economy,' because on this side of the chamber we take a holistic approach to economic growth, encompassing tax, infrastructure, connectivity, entrepreneurialism, foreign policy, and, most importantly, investment in human capital. While the coalition cancels COAG and prioritises campaigns, but not campaign bus trips, and covert fundraising efforts, Labor are getting on with the job. We are developing the policies Australia needs to prepare for the future and to bring back the fair go. Labor are stable and united. Labor have listened to the Australian people. We have the policies and the drive. Labor are ready to govern.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="269583" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GEORGIOU</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:56</span>):  I've been a passionate advocate for GST reform. I am pleased that the government has finally listened to my calls on behalf of all Western Australians for a fairer slice of the GST pie. This bill is long overdue and will finally make an attempt to correct some of the wrongs of the horizontal fiscal equalisation and its effect on successful economies like that of Western Australia. The extra money will allow the state government to fund schools, hospitals, road upgrades and other infrastructure as needed and hopefully pay down some of our huge debt in Western Australia. It is clear from the Productivity Commission report that Western Australia generated more state sourced revenue than any other state and, as a result, has been penalised for its achievements over the last decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Horizontal fiscal equalisation provides a disincentive that spins off in relation to the approval and exploitation of mineral resources located within states and territories. This is the main problem here in WA. Under the existing system, the vast bulk of the additional royalties associated with new mining developments leaks to other states and territories within two or three years. Under the current system, Australian states do not need to strengthen their own natural-resource industries because they know they can sit back and wait for GST redistribution to equalise their capacity every year. If New South Wales and Victoria developed their offshore-gas sectors, they could create billion-dollar industries and inject millions into their own state government revenues. Under the current unfair system, we have effectively removed the incentive for states to develop all their resource industries, and the nation as a whole suffers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The key question is: why would a state or territory take all the political heat associated with facilitating new mines only to have most of the additional royalty income shared with other states and territories that have not had to face similar political problems? Another critical question I'm asking is this: how is it possible that the revenue from gambling taxes is not included in the GST distribution formula? Western Australia's decision to limit pokie machines means the state has relatively little gambling tax revenue but is penalised for this in the distribution of GST.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing about the GST distribution is that it's a win/lose scenario. Giving more to WA must involve giving less to other states, particularly those that are typically overfunded—South Australia and Tasmania, in particular. It's time to get real. Instead of trying to keep everyone happy, the government should announce that the distribution of GST will move to a per capita basis over a five-year time frame, for instance, and in the short term those states that lose out would be partly compensated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the principal of HFE, all citizens should have access to similar services. The federal government should make this happen with specific grants to the states and territories. This would add accountability to the system. The way the GST is currently distributed completely lacks accountability. At the same time, I'm concerned that the government will be dipping into its own coffers to the tune of billions of dollars to ensure no state is worse off. The Treasurer said that all states would be better off with the Commonwealth injecting an additional $9 billion over 10 years to 2028-29. The states of South Australia and Tasmania and also the Northern Territory should suck it up. They've had it too good for too long at the expense of other states. They may even lift their game as a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In reality, the Commonwealth is doing the minimum as a step towards genuine GST reform. This bill is not perfect. There are still other issues that need to be changed as well. It will take about 10 years to reach full implementation. The date of effect for the updated HFE system, along with a boost to the GST revenue pool, is transitioned into effect from 2021-22, with the new arrangements applying in full from 2026-27. The GST floor is introduced in two stages, with an initial floor introduced for 2022-23 and then raised for 2024-25. The short-term transitional payments apply for three financial years, starting in 2019-20. The Productivity Commission inquiry is to be completed before 31 December 2026. Given what I mention here, I remain unconvinced about the government's desire or intent to pay off the nation's rapidly rising debt and I have concerns about its budgetary and fiscal management skills. I will be supporting this bill despite its many failings for a long-term solution. At least it's a small step in the right direction.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator URQUHART</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:01</span>):  I also rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018—a bit of a mouthful. What an absolute dog's breakfast the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government has made of this debate. Who could forget that in September this year, just weeks after ascending to the prime ministership of this country—an ascendancy he still cannot explain—Prime Minister Morrison is reported to have called the Tasmanian Treasurer, Mr Peter Gutwein, a mendicant for questioning the PM's original fix? The Tasmanian Treasurer, a mendicant for sticking up for his state! If this is the language that Mr Morrison uses to describe fellow Liberal treasurers, imagine what he says about the rest of us! He tries to hide his elitist attitude with his rolled up sleeves and silly hats, but we all know that, while the PM represents a seat in Sydney's southern suburbs, his true affinity is with Sydney's leafy eastern suburbs, exactly the same as the man that he deposed. The arrogance of the man, throwing around 'fair dinkum' more than Russell Coight, Alf Stewart and Steve Irwin to try to speak to us 'normal people' and then barking down the phone at the Treasurer of Tasmania, saying that over half a million Australians are mendicants, as if to say we're not entrepreneurial, not hardworking and not looking to grow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It hits right at the core of Tasmanians. It's a smaller state, a little island at the bottom of this big country, but we produce. For over 20 years as a union official with the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union, I worked day and night with hardworking Tasmanians to get a good deal at work, to continue to grow jobs and opportunities and to secure more investment in Tasmania. To say that our shipbuilders, our heavy vehicle manufacturers, our food manufacturers, our farmers, our component manufacturers, our miners, our foresters, our fishers and all our service providers are mendicants in this nation is an absolute disgrace. Why, Mr Morrison, are hardworking Tasmanians less worthy of good schools, great hospitals and decent roads? Why are we less worthy? And why, Mr Morrison, are hardworking Tasmanians less worthy of strong public services, decent housing and secure jobs?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">His statement to the Tasmanian Treasurer and subsequent denials go to the heart of Mr Morrison's values. They go to the core of his elitist attitude to the country. And, worse, they demonstrate again that, when flustered, Mr Morrison buckles under pressure. In the face of legitimate questions from a fellow Liberal treasurer, he wouldn't seek to work through their differences but resorted to cheap abuse, demonstrating his inability to do the job and his disdain for hardworking Tasmanians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it didn't have to be this hard for Mr Morrison. This robust debate, as we all call it now, with the Tasmanian Treasurer was about ensuring that no state was worse off. Mr Morrison denied for months that such a guarantee was necessary, even though politicians from all sides, including his own Liberal Treasurer and the Premier of Tasmania, were clear that the guarantee was crucial to ensuring that no state was left behind. So poorly did this ATM government handle this debate that they caved and announced a limited guarantee only after their own Liberal senators finally realised the problem and threatened to cross the floor to support a Labor amendment to protect every state's and territory's share.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If Mr Morrison really cared about Tasmania, really cared about supporting our students and patients and supporting our future prosperity, he would have committed to a guarantee back in July. We're not talking about a few thousand dollars here—a few days' bus hire or a few hundred trucker hats. Respected forecasters estimated that, at worst, Tasmania could lose $248 million without a guarantee. That's almost a quarter of a billion dollars. This would have been a massive hit to our health system, which is already in crisis after years of Liberal cuts and inaction. It would have further stretched our schools, leaving more Tasmanians behind after years of under-resourcing by the Liberals. Instead, Mr Morrison performed a last-gasp backflip, just days after ruling out a guarantee in Hobart. He held on for months. Why?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmanians cannot afford a deal on GST that would impact on our state's ability to deliver the best possible essential services both now and into the future. Was it because Labor sought the guarantee? Is it pure politics for this Prime Minister? He saw a way to try to solve the issue, but he failed to account for some basic concerns. Faced with legitimate questions, he bunkered down for months and months, only relenting when his own senators couldn't stand by him anymore. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It continues this GST saga to which Labor provided a clear answer years ago—a saga in which Mr Morrison, as Treasurer, delayed releasing the Productivity Commission's report until after the Tasmanian and South Australian state elections in March in a desperate ploy to help his Liberal counterparts. It is a saga that continued for three-quarters of the Braddon by-election. As Mr Morrison dodged questions from all sides about how he would find a way through without leaving Tasmanians worse off, in July he announced the first part of his GST reform—and I say 'first part' because he neglected to include a provision that no state would be worse off. His announcement was flashy. It was the typical big-spending, carefree approach to budget management that we've come to expect from the Liberals. Every state and territory would be better off, with the top-up payment a sweetener. A flashy Facebook post on the Tasmanian Liberals' page claimed, under the Turnbull government. 'Tasmania's GST funding secured—$112 million better off,' and then in brackets it said 'over the next eight years'. The word 'secured' was underlined with a big, brash, gold line—or was this a big, brash golden lie, to try to rebuild some faith with the Tasmanian people ahead of the Braddon by-election, just a few weeks later?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we fast-forward three months, the same people whose officials had authorised that Facebook post—the Tasmanian Liberal Premier and the Treasurer—said, 'We're now calling into question whether Tasmania's GST funding had been secured after all.' The Treasurer and the Premier had performed a shameless backflip and were seeking greater protections for Tasmania, a problem entirely of Mr Morrison's own creation, a problem that this bill goes some way to fixing but, in many respects, a problem that Mr Morrison has kicked down the road to the next Treasurer and the next Prime Minister, leaving much up to their discretion. He sought to fix the GST debate that he thought he could sell to everyone, but the fix was flawed. It relied on changing the horizontal fiscal equalisation model from the strongest state or territory, currently Western Australia, to the stronger of New South Wales or Victoria, with top-up payments to flow to massage any losses incurred under the new model. It takes a lot to unite the treasurers of the states and territories, particularly on this issue that has divided the country for more than a decade, but core to the concerns raised by the state and territory treasurers was that no jurisdiction be worse off in terms of direct GST receipts and, critically, that these direct top-up payments would not be offset or partially offset by a decrease in other grant funding to the states or territories.<a style="text-decoration:none;" href=""> </a></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Independent economist Saul Eslake has warned that the $9 billion top-up funding could be pooled from specific purpose payments made from the government to the states. As he notes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">After all, that's what the Abbott government sought to do in its first budget ... put its budget back into surplus by cutting payments to the states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These specific purpose payments are used to fund vital services such as schools and hospitals, services that this government continues to gut, making their delivery unviable and unsafe in some instances. In Tasmania, we see the same occurring at a state level, as our state Liberal counterparts continue to rip money from schools and hospitals under the flawed logic that cuts, cuts and more cuts will deliver their utopian budget surplus. Teachers and nurses are protesting unfair work conditions—stressful and dangerous conditions—by walking off the job, and rightly so. Under Mr Morrison's GST fix, things in Tasmania are only going to get worse if the current state and federal Liberal governments are allowed to cut essential services at every turn. Labor's model of keeping the current system and providing a top-up payment that would not come from ripping money back off the states specific purpose payments or national partnership payments is a fair and equitable system that ensures states and territories have the ability to provide the much needed services for the people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of the current GST system is the foundational idea that all states should be able to provide a standard level of services to its people. This takes into account states like Tasmania, which has to spend more to provide the same standard of services as other states due to disadvantage and isolation. Tasmania is the only state in the country that has the majority of its population living outside its capital city. We are the most geographical dispersed state. This makes the delivery of services increasingly difficult, and we have seen the current state government failing miserably with the delivery of such services. We have bed blocks in every hospital, ambulances that spend more time ramped at the entrance of a hospital emergency department than they do out on the road and a mental health crisis that sees patients seeking urgent medical care sleeping on the floors of our waiting rooms. Let that sink in. Patients are sleeping on the floors of our hospital emergency rooms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see them ripping money off the states' specific purpose payments or national partnership payments, which is a fair and equitable system that ensures states and territories have the ability to provide services for the people. Our state health and education systems are at breaking point. Every year, the cost associated with putting on a nurse or a teacher increases. Every year, the price of consumables increases. As Tasmania's population continues to age—at the fastest rate in the country—the cost of our health system is going to continue to increase.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Will Mr Morrison's fix solve that? Will it deliver more specialists to isolated Tasmanians living on the west coast? Will it be funded by reducing other grants to Tasmania, thereby not fixing any of the problems that I've just outlined? This government must ask itself, 'What level of services do Tasmanians deserve?' The potential clawback of grants and payments that are specifically used to fund, for example, early childhood education programs, essential vaccines programs and family violence prevention programs to fund a top-up payment to states and territories is not what I would call a fair go. This is the question that Mr Morrison refuses to answer, and one that, in many respects, he can't, because, of course, so much power is afforded to the government of the day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If Australia continues with governments like the ATM Liberal-National shambles—a government that cuts essential services at every opportunity, a government that slashed infrastructure spending across the country and a government that wanted Australians to work until they were 70 on lower wages and with a lower pension at retirement—then we know that they will cut grant funding to pay for part or all of this GST top-up fix. Past behaviour is the best indicator of future behaviour, and this ATM Liberal-National government has form. It's a government led by a man who says Tasmania is a mendicant state. If he is re-elected next year, we will have to beg for top-up payments and other grants to continue at the promised and current real levels. Tasmanians deserve a government that will prioritise essential services, and that government would be a Labor government. It's time to get rid of this ATM Liberal-National government before they do any more damage.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. Labor supports every state and territory getting their fair share of GST, and Labor supports this legislation. In fact, we called for this legislation. When we announced our position of making the floor which will apply to every state and territory, the former Treasurer, now Prime Minister, said that it was unnecessary and it wasn't needed. But, true to form, the Liberals have backflipped yet again on another Labor position—and we welcome it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't go into great detail about the long history of the GST distribution, but there are a few points that I would like to make. Labor welcomes the fact that the Morrison government have caved to pressure from states to provide legislative guarantee on the GST that no state will be worse off. Unfortunately, there is still no guarantee that Tasmania will not be worse off past 2026-27. This is perhaps one of the most important debates, where any changes could almost certainly damage and harm Tasmania. This ineffective Prime Minister pitted states against one another. He has made GST reform a battle between the states instead of bringing states together. Instead of bringing the country together, this Prime Minister's chaos and division not only wreaks havoc within the government; he would prefer that it did that in the community, too. The Commonwealth government should always be concerned about the long-term financial security of every state, not merely one state or the other that they call home. Tasmania's inept Liberal senators have remained largely weak and ineffective on this issue, and Tasmanians will not forget it. We saw for months how ineffective the Tasmanian Liberals were at the state and federal level in being able to lobby for a better deal for Tasmania over the long term. Again, I remind the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team: Tasmanians won't forget this. They expect you to stand up to your Prime Minister when he's dishing out a raw deal for Tasmania.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull-Morrison governments have taken Tasmania for granted in more ways than one, and not merely on the issue of the GST. As Treasurer, Scott Morrison did not deliver one new dollar on infrastructure for Tasmania or one new Public Service job. Mr Morrison and Mr Frydenberg's first plan for the GST distribution would have seen Tasmania lose a reported $248 million, without any protection. After pleas from Labor, the Treasurer rejected a plan to include the legislative guarantee that Labor had been calling for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Morrison hasn't hidden his real feelings about Tasmania. In fact, he has openly insulted Tasmania and Tasmanians when it comes to their fair share of the GST. Mr Morrison was rightly condemned recently when he described Tasmania as being 'mendicant', essentially calling Tasmanians beggars. That is what this current Prime Minister thinks of Tasmanians. No leader or Prime Minister should openly insult a state or territory. It shows an ineptness in his leadership and, frankly, an arrogance that Australia cannot afford. This comment showed Tasmanians the contempt that Mr Morrison, as Prime Minister of this country, has for Tasmania and, more importantly, for Tasmanians in general. It explains perfectly why I can recall only three times, maybe, over the last five years—as Treasurer and now as Prime Minister—that he has visited my home state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any GST formula must be fixed as equitable in its end result. States need certainty over the long term to plan for the future. Politics needs to be taken out of the GST debate to ensure business confidence and confidence within regional communities so that people will stay in Tasmania and are not forced to move to the mainland. Labor makes no apologies for standing up for our state and fighting for the best possible share of the GST revenue. Regional Tasmania is already suffering as a result of this government overseeing growing inequity between cities and regions. Tasmanians need a strong leader to stand up for their interests, not a leader who has, clearly, argued for cutting Tasmania's GST receipts behind closed doors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In July Mr Scott Morrison promised, as Treasurer, 'No state will be worse off,' under new GST distribution changes, but he has changed his mind on this issue more times than I can count. The government's policy on the GST is only a short-term reform. We know that they have their real plan in the bottom drawer and that it will harm states like my home state of Tasmania in the long term. Let's face it: a leopard never changes his spots. We know that the Prime Minister, even before he came to this place, did nothing about being open and transparent in his business dealings, particularly before he was sacked as the general manager of Tourism Australia. So his track record is not a good record. Tasmanians don't trust him and I don't believe they will change their view of him heading into the next federal election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is only passing the buck to future governments by not guaranteeing funding for Tasmanian hospitals and schools over the 2026-27 commitments. Mr Morrison is the Don Draper of Australian politics, without the talent or the good looks. This Prime Minister is a man who was sacked, as I said, from Tourism Australia, and it has now been revealed why he was moved on. He was appointed by his mates in the Liberal Party, and he was sacked unanimously by the board of Tourism Australia and by the Liberal tourism minister of the day. Not even John Howard was prepared to stand up for him. That's the calibre of the man who has taken the chair in the big office as Prime Minister of this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are serious findings by the Australian National Audit Office. It is not Labor saying these things; it was the Australian National Audit Office. The former Treasurer, and now Prime Minister, oversaw Tourism Australia from 2004 to 2006. Eighteen months into his contract he was sacked, terminated—with very healthy severance pay of $300,000, I might add. This has been revealed in recent days because I think it's important. It goes to the calibre of the man who is the Prime Minister. Tourism Australia and the deals that he did—that information was kept from the board. So, as he has proven to be as Prime Minister, he is not open and transparent. The procurement guidelines were breached, and private companies were engaged on contracts worth $184 million before paperwork was signed and without appropriate value-for-money assessment. That's the calibre—</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will continue. The procurement guidelines were breached, and private companies were engaged on contracts worth $184 million before paperwork was signed and without appropriate value-for-money assessments. This now disgraced ex-ad man used to be in charge of Treasury, and he is now the Prime Minister. No wonder he has been so inconsistent on the GST. This is a Prime Minister who is anti accountability and anti transparency. Clearly, he makes decisions on the run. He has thought bubbles without consultation. He actually became Prime Minister this way.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania relies heavily on the GST, and I will always stand up for my home state. The GST goes to the heart of how you can actually provide, through your governments, to the people of Tasmania. That includes the funding of our hospitals. As my good colleague Senator Urquhart outlined, we have people sleeping on the floor in our accident and emergency departments, in hospital after hospital, because of this government's cuts to hospitals. Our schools have been cut. All of this relates back to the GST. We have the most ageing population. We have a population with, unfortunately, some of the worst chronic diseases in this country. We rely on our portion of the GST. It is irrelevant whether it is a Liberal or Labor state government. We need that money for our residents, for all Tasmanians. So I will of course stand up and call out this Prime Minister for his backflips, his thought bubbles, his lack of consultation, his lack of empathy for those people who can least afford it. I will never apologise for standing up for my home state. That's what I was elected to do. If the Prime Minister and those opposite don't like to have his behaviour called out—it goes to good judgement, because leopards never change their spots—then I will do that. I will take a reprimand any day of the week when it comes to standing up for what I believe all Australians should know and understand about this Prime Minister and this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He had another backdown only yesterday, where he cut the funding to Foodbank Australia. Why did he back down? Because he was getting political heat—even from the National Farmers' Federation. That's the calibre of this Prime Minister. He was trying to outscrooge Mr Scrooge on the eve of Christmas. I will never apologise for saying that. Any cuts to the GST revenue will have a devastating impact on service delivery in regional areas of my home state. They have already been struggling under the Abbot/Turnbull/Morrison government and their cuts to education and health, as I outlined earlier. There has been so much division from those opposite. Clearly, we know that they have tried to instil the infighting among themselves into the rest of the nation by pitting one state and territory against another. That's not the Australian way. A Prime Minister should be bringing the country together. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our hospitals are in crisis. Our schools are already under-resourced after years of Liberal cuts. Today we hear from the Institute of Health and Welfare that Tasmania has a higher prevalence of mental health risk, more than any other state in this country, and needs funding. We had an inquiry that outlined that—that 14-year-old Tasmanian having to wait 18 months to get psychological assistance and counselling. That's not good enough. That comes back to the lack of GST and the cuts made to health by this government. The funding for mental health in Tasmania is the worst of any state. Currently, Tasmania can't provide the national standard of care needed for people suffering a mental illness. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that senators in this place have been working very hard through shadow responsibilities to make sure that Australians are aware of the need for more money to go into mental health. I was participating in the community affairs committee hearing in Tasmania. We know only too well that Tasmania needs another 50 psychiatric beds just to meet the national average. Tasmania just can't afford to lose even one dollar of GST. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side, Labor is proud of its record on the GST. Tasmania's federal parliamentary Labor Party lobbied all four Liberal senators, calling on them to support this amendment which protected the legislation and our state's GST share, which they ultimately did. But during the whole lead-up to that the Liberal Senate team in Tasmania was silent. It seems that Mr Morrison and the Liberals have finally woken up to these concerns, despite repeatedly saying that they would not support a legislative guarantee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor still has reservations about what may occur post 2026-27 if a coalition government is on the Treasury benches after the next election. Can I say once again, Tasmania cannot afford a deal on GST that would impact on our state's ability to deliver the best possible essential services now and into the future. The community knows that Labor will always stand up and fight for our fair share of GST. We know and the community knows—Tasmanians know—that the Liberals won't, because, as shown by their hatred for Medicare, their DNA is not one that actually cares about everyday Tasmanians or Australians. They can't be trusted with the GST and we know they can't be trusted with the economy. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  I welcome this long overdue change to the GST distribution scheme, which Western Australian Labor has been fighting for for a long time. I pay tribute to Premier Mark McGowan and his government on their advocacy and fighting for this change and working with federal Labor to get workable change on the national agenda—advocacy that I must say was sorely lacking from the Barnett government, but perhaps he knew at the time that it would fall on deaf ears. It has been unfathomable to me, with the number of WA cabinet ministers in the current government, why this issue remained unaddressed for so long. I commend Bill Shorten and Chris Bowen for putting forward solutions and for committing to a legislated floor. These strong commitments have helped induce action from the current government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, the GST was introduced in 2000 as a way to raise revenue to support the states and territories. The money raised has been distributed through the Commonwealth Grants Commission policy of horizontal fiscal equalisation. This is a method that attempts to ensure that all Australians benefit from the wealth of the country and that no state or territory is disadvantaged by circumstance. It is seen, in principle, as a fair and equitable way of ensuring that all Australians benefit from the wealth we generate as a nation. But the sad fact is that, 18 years on, the model of horizontal fiscal equalisation is not working as it should and some states, particularly my home state of WA, have been severely disadvantaged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal government have been slow to recognise WA's needs and, in my view, have taken for granted the seats that they hold there. Our GST relativity fell from 0.98 on the commencement of the GST to less than 0.30 in 2015-16. It rose slightly in 2017-18. WA received the lowest amount of GST revenue per capita, at just $872 per person in 2017-18. That does not match the expenditure of Western Australians, who buy goods that are subject to the GST. The main reason WA's fair share has fallen has been the mining boom. WA was assessed as being able to raise significantly more revenue than other states. This is via mining royalties. Additionally, specific approaches from the Commonwealth Grants Commission in working out GST relativity work against WA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At last the government listened to these concerns and last year commissioned a report to look at the distribution. In May the Productivity Commission released its findings on the current state of the GST and horizontal fiscal equalisation. It found that our system was failing to keep pace with the changing situation and economic circumstances that our states and territories find themselves in. It found in particular that resource heavy states, such as WA, were negatively affected by the current system. As resource prices are determined by the international market, they are very much prone to fluctuation, making it difficult to pre-empt how much revenue a state will get.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current system fails to incentivise states to be creative with their taxation system to try to improve it. With the risk and uncertainty that surround today's economic climate, states and territories don't want to risk their GST revenue pool by looking at other innovative ways of raising revenue. When states try to improve their financial position, their share of GST decreases, and this has had a significant impact on Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this in mind, I very much support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018 as proposed, because it sticks to the principles of horizontal fiscal equalisation but does not distort that decision-making within government by punishing good innovation. I commend the state government of WA, and indeed the state's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, for putting forward solutions that have been adopted. The reason Western Australia's share in the mining boom has fallen is that the Commonwealth Grants Commission assessed WA improperly. It assessed WA as being able to raise significantly more revenue than other states via mining royalties. It did this because it has forward-projected those revenues without taking into account the actual drop in revenue prices from mining royalties to Western Australia. In addition—and this is a very perverse thing within the GST assessment—the exclusion of gambling revenues from GST assessment for all states penalises WA, because, unlike other states, we don't have a gambling industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of all these factors, our GST share has fallen at times to a record low of 30c in the dollar, the lowest in the country. And while the share is projected to increase to 47c in the dollar for this financial year, it is still significantly lower than that of any state in the country. We previously raised concerns about the use of the three-year rolling average for the price of key commodities, including iron ore, particularly in the period following the end of the mining boom, when the price of iron ore and therefore the royalty dropped but the assessment of how much revenue Western Australia would raise did not. The revenue that was assumed simply did not exist. Frankly, it was obvious at that point that it wouldn't exist. But the formulas, according to the ask, couldn't be changed, because it might be a bit unpredictable. This is no way to assess state finances. Frankly, but for the floor, these problems still very much exist inside the assessment process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation and the major change in this bill is the introduction of a floor to prevent the share of the GST from falling to the kinds of record lows that Western Australia has seen. A floor of 75c is essential to ensure that this situation that has affected WA does not happen again. We did experience an enormous strengthening of our financial situation in WA during the mining boom. This might seem like a fair trade while the state is doing well, but the old GST formula was not designed to accommodate the rapidly changing economic environment in which the state currently finds itself. Just as people were saying that the Western Australian economy could reach no limit, that is was going to keep growing, the mining boom ended. Our share of GST has not recovered to pre-mining-boom levels, because of the lag in that assessment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These assessments, while not changing in this legislation, will be mitigated by this new floor within the benchmark system. The benchmark for redistribution will be changed from the strongest-performing state—which is currently WA, but that is moving to change—to the strongest of either New South Wales or Victoria. There's good reason to do this. By changing it, we can ensure that these spikes are minimised, because these states have more-diversified and larger economies, so they're not as subject to a particular runaway phenomenon in a particular economic stream.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, Western Australia has not reaped the benefits of the mining boom. We've also had to contend with rapid population growth and remote service delivery. This redistributive effect through horizontal fiscal equalisation has been a very poor motivator for growing the wealth of the state and the nation. So, I don't object to the redistributive elements that ensure that we support the whole of our nation, but I don't want to see perverse outcomes in our GST situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked the Parliamentary Library to do some modelling on this, with the following example: if the mining states of WA and Queensland seek to raise royalty rates in order to increase revenues, the Commonwealth grant process causes them to lose almost as much GST revenue as they would gain in royalty revenue. I asked the Parliamentary Library to model this for me. Their example was to suppose that there were eight states, all of equal size, and that the states collectively raise $8 billion in mining revenue. When working out an average that each state should be able to raise from mining royalties, the Commonwealth Grants Commission would arrive at an average of $1 billion for each state. It would then provide the Commonwealth Grants Commission with the GST revenue to adjust up or to withhold revenue to adjust down to ensure that each state received exactly $1 billion of that value.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, suppose that, of the $8 billion raised, $7 billion was raised in just one state, with the remainder being raised equally across the remaining seven states. What incentive does it provide to those other states to raise revenue? Frankly, none. There is no incentive at all, because they have to take on the challenges of how to raise revenue. The impact of that is that it will just be redistributed to the other states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, as I highlighted before, there are problems with the way that the Commonwealth Grants Commission deals with gambling revenue. It considers that there are no material factors outside of the control of an individual state that change the amount each state could raise from gambling revenue. In the view of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, each state has the same capacity to raise gambling revenue, irrespective of whether they choose to do so or not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is great irony in this. Arguably, some states have made decisions to forgo revenue, with policies opposed to mining. But, in effect, they have not forgone revenue because of this; they have benefited from Western Australia's revenue. But Western Australia has chosen not to have a gambling industry, particularly poker machines, on policy grounds. We don't like the social implications of embedding pokies in social venues around the state and then mopping up the gap in social consequences later. But the Commonwealth Grants Commission's approach still assumes that WA could raise this revenue and the average amount of gambling revenue as for other states. This is, if you like, included in our assumed funding base for the state. This is completely perverse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of this, Western Australian people are missing out. For every one dollar they have spent at the shop on GST-taxed goods, they have sent up to 7c out of the state. Western Australians have, rightly, had enough. Linking the index of the redistribution to volatile and heavily-fluctuating resource markets, rather than to broader and diversified economies, has not lent itself to stability and fairness in the system. New South Wales and Victoria have well-performing and, more importantly, more stable and diverse economies. Linking this index to their performance ensures that our GST system remains consistent and predictable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I commend federal capital Labor for taking the lead on this and for recognising the needs of Western Australia. They started with the Fair Share for WA Fund, then a floor and committed to a legislative floor. I am keenly aware that states and territories need to be treated fairly under the new system, that sudden changes could put pressure on the states and territories and they could end up worse off as a result of this change. Western Australia has lived through this. We need plans that promote stability and ensure states and territory governments can plan for the future. The current system is highly susceptible to changes in economic circumstances, and, indeed, property taxes changes can also adversely affect the share of the GST received. These are areas that are also highly volatile in today's economic environment. So we do understand the concerns of other states in looking at this legislation. It has been extremely hard for WA to deal with this fiscal uncertainty, and I wouldn't wish that uncertainty upon any other state. To this end, we support the guarantee that no state or territory will be worse off during the six-year transition period while the new system is rolled out. I'm not going to go into detail, but I recognise the role that top-up funds will have during this critical time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the bill also requires the referral of our GST system to the Treasurer to refer it to the Productivity Commission to see whether the new system is working and that it will need to report by the end of the year, in 2026. Stability should be the purpose of this bill. Uncertainty about what happens next does not help our cause. This legislation is a good step in addressing the inequalities that exist in our GST system. The floor so desperately needed by WA will perhaps, in the future, benefit other states. It will ensure that states and territories receive a reliable and predictable share of the GST that is fair and equitable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Australia has had a significantly difficult time, and we have been justifiably outraged by the lack of our fair share in GST revenue. All of this has happened at a time when Western Australia's net debt has grown per capita to the highest of any other state. Our own revenues dropped at the same time as our GST revenue dropped. At the same time, with the end of the mining boom, the labour force participation rate dramatically decreased, with a fall from 69 per cent in February 2016 to 57 per cent in 2016. We had an increasing population, increased unemployment and decreasing participation rates, and none of these things were good news for Western Australia. At the same time as all of this was happening, for every dollar spent in the consumption of GST goods, up to 70c went to other states. That's 70c for every dollar paid of GST. We only kept 30c in the dollar. That has improved. WA will foreseeably receive 47c in the dollar in 2017-18, so that has improved somewhat. But it still means that, for every litre of petrol a Western Australian buys—and we know that petrol prices are at record highs—we are sending 6.6c out of the state. This has gone on too long. This legislation is welcome and overdue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to highlight that Western Australia's fight for a fair share will not end there. Given the size of our state and the many remote regional communities within it that are difficult to service, we are still getting a raw deal in many other areas. Western Australians are also concerned to know that, with 10.8 per cent of Australia's population, in other areas not including the GST we receive just seven per cent of the Commonwealth spend. This is less than every other state or territory by a significant factor. Today I'm pleased we can work together inside our Federation to improve cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth so that we can continue to be a competitive nation but also a compassionate nation that fairly distributes our resources to maximise the wellbeing of our nation. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  I'm certainly not going to mince words in the very short time I have for now on how very important this issue of the GST is to the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory is facing unprecedented falls in GST revenue, which is impacting on the government's ability to deliver core services. This impact is widening the gap on Indigenous disadvantage and infrastructure deficits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">NT GST revenue has fallen by $500 million per year. This $500 million shortfall is entrenched by the watering down of horizontal fiscal equalisation principles in this bill, remembering that the GST makes up 50 per cent of the Northern Territory's total revenue and the NT government's $6.5 billion budget. The NT has a relatively limited own-source revenue base, which is 30 per cent of total revenue, despite the new $37 billion INPEX LNG project coming online. I certainly want to remind senators that this project is also subject to the Commonwealth's 40 per cent petroleum resource rent tax and 30 per cent company tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NT's current sharp economic downturn is exacerbating the situation, with the debt-to-revenue ratio rising. Since 2016, the NT's GST revenue forecasts have seen a cumulative decline of $3.4 billion over the forward estimates. As a small, self-governing member of the Federation, with a limited own-source revenue base compared to the larger jurisdictions, it is disproportionately more difficult for the Northern Territory to absorb significant changes to its GST revenue. While all economies are subject to cyclical effects, as a small, open economy, the economic cycles in the Territory are more pronounced than in other jurisdictions. The NT's making some very tough decisions in its fiscal response to the economic downturn, and this includes over $800 million in savings and efficiencies and new own-sourcing revenue measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory, regardless of the government in power, has always been a strong supporter of the principles of horizontal fiscal equalisation, so it's enormously disappointing to see the failure of the Northern Territory senator Nigel Scullion and his Country Liberal Party to stand up for the Territory around these changes to GST that will impact adversely on the Northern Territory. Senator Scullion failed to say a single word when the then Treasurer, Scott Morrison, announced last year that the government was slashing GST distribution to the Territory by an estimated $2 billion over the next four years, and he's certainly done nothing to get his colleagues to listen to the Northern Territory government's very reasonable argument about funding essential services, such as housing, education and roads. He's refusing to say, as Minister for Indigenous Affairs, what impact this new funding arrangement will have on efforts in the Territory to close the gap on Indigenous disadvantage. Every February we certainly talk about the need to look at the report card of Indigenous disadvantage and closing the gap, which the parliament admits that we're not doing. How then, when we know we desperately need extra resources and support in the Northern Territory, are we going to close that gap?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's certainly been a parade of Liberal government figures through the Territory in recent months, all talking up their candidates in Lingiari and Solomon, but not once have any of them said what they'll be doing about this unprecedented financial situation facing the Northern Territory. They have not said one word about how they will be advocating for us, ensuring that we get our fair share. Not once have any of these candidates ever said what their plans are for dealing with this reduction in GST revenue which will impact the people of the Northern Territory the hardest. You cannot pretend to be standing up for the Territory, for the most disadvantaged communities in this country, and saying you're their voice, yet refuse to front the people who have made the decision to change the basis for GST redistribution.</span>

I'm just pointing out the obvious flaws in the premise of the question by pointing out the strong support by the subsequent tourism minister, Martin Ferguson. The other point I would make is that the highly distinguished former chair of Tourism Australia, the former Prime Minister Tim Fischer, was also on the public record indicating what an outstanding job the Prime Minister did as the managing director of Tourism Australia. And I also would refer the Senate to my letter to the President, which was copied to Senator Wong, where I pointed out that I could confirm that the flagship campaign, 'So where the bloody hell are you?' developed under the stewardship of the Prime Minister as managing director, contributed to an additional $2.1 billion in the industry's bottom line over 2007—</span>

I can also confirm that the performance requirements for the Prime Minister's contract at Tourism Australia were fully satisfied. I can also confirm that the number of nights stayed by international visitors increased by 12 per cent, that the tourism spend in Australia increased by 10 per cent. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the Liberal-National government continues to put in place policies that will ensure that the small businesses of Australia can continue to prosper and grow, because, as we know, when small businesses in Australia prosper and grow, they create more jobs for Australians and the entire nation benefits. As a government, we have continually put in place policies that will back small and family businesses. Why? Because they are the backbone of the Australian economy. Whether it's lowering their taxes to 25 per cent five years earlier than planned, whether it's extending the instant asset write-off or whether it is cutting red tape now to the tune of $6 billion, we will continue to deliver.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, colleagues, we have put in place yet another policy that will benefit the small and medium businesses of Australia. The Treasurer and I announced an important initiative to further help small businesses, in particular those in start-ups and in the early stages of growth, to attract new employees. We're doing this by simplifying the regulatory framework relating to employee share schemes. What this will do is allow employees to invest in the business that is actually employing them. Specifically, we are increasing the value limit of eligible financial products that can be offered in a 12-month period. We're going to double that, from $5,000 to $10,000, to make it more appealing for employees. We're also going to expand employee share schemes to include contribution plans, and we're going to allow small businesses to offer employee share schemes without publicly disclosing commercially sensitive information. </span>

They employ almost seven million Australians. Seven million Australians rely on small and family businesses for their jobs. We also know that the best form of welfare is a job. So when you put in place job-creating policies, as we on the Liberal-National side of the government do, you ensure that the businesses in Australia are able to operate under these policies. They can prosper and grow. And what do they do? They create more jobs for Australians. That is exactly what you are seeing under the Liberal-National government. The unemployment rate fell by 0.3 percentage points last month to stand at five per cent in September. This is the lowest level since September 2012. The economy has created almost 1.2 million jobs since we were elected to office in 2013. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

If you put in place policies, for example, like the Labor Party wants to do, which are going to increase taxes on business, what do you do? They have less money to spend on their business, to invest in their business, and they have less money to grow. As such, they are unable to create more jobs. Under this Liberal-National government we have now seen almost 1.2 million jobs created since we were elected to office in 2013. That is an increase of 10 per cent. Welfare reliance is at a 25-year low. Why? Because we are getting people off welfare and into work. But this only happens when you understand that you need to put in place the economic framework in which businesses are able to prosper and grow. Lower taxes are fundamental to that. That is something that those of us on this side of the chamber will continue to back every step of the way. </span>

The minister's letter states, 'I can confirm that the performance requirements for the Prime Minister's contract at Tourism Australia were fully satisfied.' Minister, why was Prime Minister Morrison sacked only a year and a half into his contract by a unanimous decision of the board without any dissent whatsoever? </span>

I can see that the Labor Party is interested in the ancient past. We are interested in the future. We also understand that the people of Australia know very well what an outstanding performer Prime Minister Morrison has been in every single one of his ministerial and shadow ministerial responsibilities. They know how effective he has been in fixing up Labor's mess at our borders. They know how effective he has been in initiating and implementing social welfare reform, getting people back from welfare into work. That, of course, is why the proportion of working-age Australians on welfare today is the lowest it has been in 25 years. I know that Prime Minister Morrison, as Treasurer, was the key architect to turn around the situation that we inherited from Labor. When Labor lost government in 2013, when Mr Bowen was Treasurer in 2013, they left behind a weakening economy, rising unemployment and a rapidly deteriorating budget position. Today, the economy is stronger, employment growth is stronger, the unemployment rate is well below where it was anticipated it would be—down to five per cent—and the budget position is stronger and improving. At the next election, the Australian people will be contrasting the strong plan, the strong team and the strong performance of the Prime Minister against the reckless, anti-business, class-warfare, politics-of-envy agenda of Mr Shorten turning Australian against Australian—</span>

I'm not in this chamber representing a Prime Minister a couple of prime ministers ago. And the other point I would make is that you are flogging a dead horse. How about focusing on the Australian people? How about focusing on giving the Australian people the best possible opportunity to get ahead? How about focusing on a pro-business, lower taxes, increased growth, more-jobs agenda where more Australians will have the opportunity to get a job, to build a career and to get the best possible—</span>

We will continue to make decisions to ensure that Australians today and into the future have the best possible opportunity to get ahead.</span>

Senator Payne, your New Zealand counterpart, Winston Peters, put out a press statement today about the fact that the Japanese whaling fleet had left for another summer of slaughter in the Southern Ocean last night. When I checked before question time, you or your department hadn't made a statement. Could you please take this opportunity to make a statement to the chamber today and outline what you're going to do about it?</span>

As I think I've indicated in the chamber before, we are disappointed that Japan's decision to return to the Southern Ocean this summer to undertake scientific whaling has commenced. We are clear in our opposition to all forms of commercial and scientific whaling. I would note that the International Whaling Commission found that Japan had not justified the need for its whaling in the Southern Ocean and, indeed, recommended that Japan cease these whaling programs unless they can demonstrate a scientific need for what is known as lethal research. And we continue to make representations to Japan.</span>

We, in fact, have an extremely valuable, high-level, special, strategic partnership with Japan, which is borne of many years engagement—and very important bilateral engagement, at that—across a range of areas. We cooperate in our own region here in the Pacific and more broadly in the Indo-Pacific. We are cooperating strongly in relation to the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, which I would have thought may have been of passing interest to the Australian Greens, but perhaps not. That denuclearisation requires the engagement of countries like Japan, Australia, the United States, China and a number of our other counterparts to ensure the greatest pressure is applied to the DPRK in relation to that denuclearisation. In relation to whaling, Japan is, of course, well aware of Australia's strong opposition to commercial whaling and to scientific whaling, as it is described. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Given they have essentially militarised their whaling fleet—they've passed new legislations to give their whaling fleets new powers—and they are going to the Southern Ocean, how are they committing to a rules based order, thumbing their nose at the International Court of Justice and threatening to walk away from the International Whaling Commission? Once again, will you or the Prime Minister raise this issue directly with Shinzo Abe on Friday?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister for Communications and the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:24</span>):  Thanks, Senator Gichuhi, for the question. I'm pleased to advise colleagues that during the June 2018 quarter the NDIS reached a major milestone: over 180,000 Australians with disability now receive life-changing support, with over 54,000 people receiving supports for the first time. Delivering this important reform to improve outcomes for Australians with significant and permanent disability will inevitably involve some challenges, but the important thing is to address issues quickly as they arise. The National Disability Insurance Agency is rolling out a range of improvements to enhance the experience of participants and also service providers. The schedule is being finalised with states and territories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The improvements include a stronger focus on community, mainstream, informal and employment supports during pre-planning; face-to-face plan-implementation meetings; and improvements to participant and provider portals. It's worth noting that 188 people with disability and carers, 76 providers and 124 frontline staff have contributed to the pathway review through workshops and individual interviews. The agency held 37 workshops across the country, and more than 1,100 people attended these. The workshops focused on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the remote and very remote communities, complex support needs, psychosocial disability and early-childhood intervention. The feedback has directly influenced the NDIS pathway reforms. Additionally, the NDIA will hire 750 additional staff in 2018-19 and provide targeted training to 6,000 planners and frontline staff to further support the reform of the work.</span>

At full scheme, 460,000 Australians are expected to be NDIS participants. Demand for disability services is projected to require up to 90,000 full-time-equivalent workers over the next five years, and NDIS providers are growing in response to this increased demand. In the June 2018 quarter the number of active registered providers increased by 15 per cent, from 7,327 to 8,457. Importantly, many Australians with disability will be better placed to work when they have the right supports through the NDIS. For instance, getting the personal care support that you need first thing in the morning, when you need it, puts you in a much better position to pursue work.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Point No. 2 is that the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement is a very important agreement. We were very pleased when President Widodo and our Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, were able to reach and form a conclusion to those negotiations during their meeting on 31 August 2018. But, as was always going to be the case, as is always the case with these sorts of processes, there is now a process underway to finalise the specific text of the agreement in both languages. That is the usual process. When that process has concluded, the agreement will be signed. The Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement—let me stress this again—will benefit both countries and is an important next step in what is an incredibly important and highly valued relationship.</span>

I know how seriously she takes this issue and how important she knows lower power prices are for the Victorian economy, especially given the strong manufacturing industry in that state. That is why the government has taken action to reduce energy prices: because we want to protect jobs, particularly in our manufacturing sector. We want to help households lower their budgets and ensure they can balance those budget every year, and we are already taking action to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have, for the first time, introduced regulations that allow the Australian government to restrict the exports of gas from Australia to ensure there is sufficient gas here domestically. In the last 18 months that has helped lower gas prices by about 20 per cent in the spot market, and offers of gas to large businesses have fallen from $20 a gigajoule, and sometimes more, to less than $10 a gigajoule at the moment—so a 50 per cent reduction in offers of gas to large energy users, particularly those large manufacturers in Senator Hume's home state of Victoria. We've also ended the ability of large companies to challenge regulatory decisions under the so-called limited merits review process. That decision alone has helped save consumers $6 billion by not allowing large companies to challenge regulatory decisions that have been properly made. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We realise though, of course, there is a lot more to do, and that's why we have an extensive plan to lower power prices further. We're doing three major things. We are ensuring that consumers get the lowest possible offer they can by making sure default offers from the large companies come down, and the energy minister met with the energy producers last week to do that. We are also introducing legislation later this year that will ensure governments have a big stick to wield to make sure energy companies don't dud consumers and to provide strong competition in these markets. Finally, we are encouraging investment in new and reliable power generation, because we understand, we know, greater supply of power will mean lower power prices for Australians.</span>

To demonstrate how important this issue is to our economy, you just have to look at South Australia, where currently electricity prices are some of the highest in the world. They are sitting at around 47.8c per kilowatt hour. South Australians are paying more for electricity than Latvians, at 25.6c per kilowatt hour; Estonians, at 23.4c per kilowatt hour; Romanians, at 21.2c per kilowatt hour; and Hungarians, at 19.3c per kilowatt hour. That is not good enough and that has to change. It's the result of renewable energy targets being forced on South Australian consumers. And now we have a Victorian government wanting to do the same. They're seeing that South Australia has done this to their economy: 'Let's have some of that too.' That's exactly the approach of Daniel Andrews, and it's going to fail in Victoria, just as it has failed in South Australia. We need to get back to the job of providing reliable power to all Australians. </span>

We also must ensure that we object to and reject this notion that we shouldn't develop our own resources to provide energy to Australian businesses and families. We are lucky to be blessed with significant renewable coal, gas and other energy sources, and we should develop all of these to help lower power prices. I welcome the fact that, over the weekend in local government elections in South Australia, candidates were elected that support the development of the Great Australian Bight and support the development of oil and gas basins in this country. Indeed, the former antidrilling mayor, Peter Clements, has been defeated by a new mayor, Michael Pengilly, who supports the development of oil and gas on Kangaroo Island, and that is why we need to develop our resources and lower prices for all consumers.</span>

In response to a question without notice yesterday concerning the need to prevent immigration from extremist Muslim countries, you repeatedly made it clear that the government had no intention of changing its current indiscriminate immigration policy. However, following yet another terrorist attack in Melbourne at the weekend by a Muslim so-called refugee, the Prime Minister stated: 'Radical, violent extremist Islam is the greatest threat to Australia's national security.' If the government admits the threat posed by Islam to this nation but refuses to change the current indiscriminate immigration program that allows radical, violent extremist Islamists to continue to come here, is it not wilfully refusing to protect the Australian people from this threat? </span>

Senator Anning, the response to Senator Hanson's question yesterday is the same response to your question today—Australia has a non-discriminatory immigration policy. I also reiterate what the Prime Minister has said in relation to the terrorist attack in Melbourne. This attack underlies the need for all of us to remain constantly vigilant, never deterred and always defiant in the face of terrorism. We cannot be blind to, or ignorant of, the challenges our society faces. It is clear that religious extremism—in particular, radical and dangerous Islamic extremism—is a major threat in Australia, just as it is in other countries. Radical violent extremist Islam opposes our very way of life. Our religious leaders have a special responsibility to call out extremism and dangerous teachings and ideologies and to alert authorities to radicalised members of their community. We must all—government, communities and religious leaders—work together respectfully to ensure that we continue to prevail in the face of this evil.</span>

The Prime Minister has made very clear his position in relation to border security. Our Prime Minister is the former minister for immigration. As the former minister for immigration and now in his role as the Prime Minister of Australia he has made it incredibly clear—very clear—to the Australian people that national security is the No. 1 concern of this government and it will continue to be. We will continue to put in place policies, as we have done for the entire time we have been elected, to ensure that the Australian people and the country of Australia are safe.</span>

I'm advised that Gretals had applied for a bridging grant under the Global Connections Fund in 2017. The fund is administered on behalf of the government by the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering. The Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering has confirmed that, while Gretals was found to meet the requirements to be awarded a grant, the company withdrew its application. Furthermore, the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering has confirmed that no funds were paid from the Global Connections Fund to Gretals.</span>

Australia, of course, is committed to a constructive relationship with China, which is founded on shared interests and mutual respect. It is a complex, dynamic relationship that engages a range of national interests. China's rise over the past 40 years has been overwhelmingly beneficial for its people and the region, including Australia. From almost zero trade 40 years ago, China is Australia's largest export market, taking a third of all our merchandise exports, and our largest market for services, primarily tourism and education. It is also our fifth largest source of direct investment. As significant as it is, our relationship with China is much broader than trade and investment, and occasionally we have differences, but we manage those on the basis of mutual respect.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that this government and China designated the relationship as a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2014. The breadth of this contemporary relationship was reflected in my discussions with my counterpart state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi in Beijing last week at the fifth foreign and strategic dialogue. Australia and China are engaging on a broad set of national interests—regional stability and development, economic growth, law enforcement and security, scientific research and, of course, people-to-people links, which go back many, many years between our countries. The discussions followed Minister Birmingham's successful visit to Shanghai to attend the extremely impressive inaugural import expo, which saw literally hundreds of thousands of visitors in Shanghai. The Prime Minister will have further opportunities to engage with Chinese and regional leaders at the forthcoming APEC East Asia Summit and the G20 meetings. Our engagement reflects our continued practical commitment to deepening our relationship with China.</span>

We want to see infrastructure investment that is transparent, non-discriminatory and open, and upholds robust standards so that investments deliver long-term benefits and avoid unsustainable debt burdens. We welcome deeper cooperation with partners, including China, in the Pacific where we have shared interests. During last week's dialogue, we agreed to explore opportunities where we could work together in the region to support security and stability and prosperity—for example, building on our successful trilateral partnership with Papua New Guinea to address malaria. During my visit last week, I also met the chair of the recently established China International Development Cooperation Agency and proposed the establishment of a development policy dialogue and technical exchanges between his agency and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</span>

Next month, China will be hosting the fifth Australia-China high-level dialogue, another initiative of this government to further develop and deepen our relationship. I'm pleased to advise that former Prime Minister John Howard will lead the Australian delegation to this year's dialogue on 7 December. The high-level dialogue brings together senior Australian and Chinese leaders from across government, business, academia, media and the arts to discuss key aspects of the bilateral relationship, which will include diplomatic, trade and economic relations, those people-to-people links of which I spoke earlier, and international and regional cooperation. This year's meeting will also coincide with the 40th anniversary of the Australia-China Council, another element of the Australia-China relationship. It was established by Malcolm Fraser in 1978 and is a further example of our long-term commitment to the development and depth of this relationship.</span>

Senator Watt, you know more than I do, because I've only just been informed of that matter—by you. Whether or not it's true, I have no idea, but I'll take it on your word that it is. I have not discussed it with my former chief of staff, but I also would make the point that he is a private citizen, and it is sub judice. Also, Senator Watt, you would be aware that you can issue a subpoena to anyone. It does not mean that they actually had information that is relevant to the case. The AWU may well want to subpoena Mr Shorten, for example, to ask him, 'Did you authorise the $25,000 donation that you gave to your own campaign?' The AWU may wish to subpoena Mr Shorten to answer the question, 'Did you authorise the $100,000 that you gave to GetUp! that was the money of the member of the AWU?' They are the fundamental questions, and those on the other side have asked a lot of questions in relation to Mr Morrison over events that occurred some time ago. Well, maybe Mr Shorten ought to front up. The AWU can subpoena him, because you can subpoena anybody. </span>

And perhaps the AWU would like to subpoena Mr Shorten so that he can absolutely give evidence—once and for all—that yes, he did or he didn't authorise the $25,000 he gave to his own campaign and authorise properly, in accordance with union rules, the $100,000 he gave to GetUp!</span>

Thank you very much for your advocacy for our agricultural communities. I do note that your home state of New South Wales is 100 per cent drought affected. This is one of the worst droughts affecting regional Australia in our history. I note that 70 per cent of Queensland has been drought affected for over six years, most critically in the western areas where 66 per cent of our national beef herd is sourced, but it has been moving south. Rainfall deficiencies have also increased in the agricultural districts of South Australia. Compared with other areas, for the January to October periods since 1900 year to date, rainfall has been the third lowest on record for the Murray-Darling Basin, the fourth lowest for New South Wales and the eighth lowest for Victoria.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed, as a government, to standing with not just our farmers but the drought-affected communities. On 26 October, the Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, hosted a national drought summit. The national drought summit put our national leaders, key stakeholders and organisations together to talk about actions, deliver assistance, cut red tape and tackle the gaps that need addressing. It was a sign of the severity of the drought that each premier of our nation was actually there to stand with key stakeholders, regional communities and agricultural experts to look at how we best, as a nation, come together to address the drought.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the Drought Communities Program, initially we had $75 million provided in initial support for $1 million for each of the 60 affected councils. As a result of the drought summit, and me reassessing the data, we've been able to extend that to another 21 councils, 17 of which are in South Australia. This is a program where local councils will use that $1 million to ensure that they not only employ locally for projects but, importantly, source the materials locally to keep small businesses alive and thriving in those affected communities.</span>

As the drought continues, it's not just our farmers that are affected, but, increasingly, it is the regional towns and small businesses that we want to survive and thrive when the rains actually come. The Tambo regional council will be undertaking up to eight different projects across their region to improve and upgrade their local facilities and amenities that will promote employment and economic development. Similarly, Longreach Regional Council have been approved to start construction of a desalination plant in Ilfracombe. This will secure a sustainable water source for the community of Ilfracombe, which is experiencing prolonged drought. Finally, when I was in Franklin Harbour in South Australia over the break, I was able to meet Jaz, a local drought support officer—other employment opportunities that affected councils can use this money for.</span>

It comes from those on the other side of the chamber. I remain concerned that, despite the personal explanation by Senator Cameron yesterday, there doesn't seem to be a real understanding of the challenge of the drought from those on the other side. Farmers and regional communities across the nation are suffering, with families experiencing real financial hardship and emotional hardship. Small businesses in regional towns are struggling to pay the bills and keep people employed. We want to see those small businesses thrive, because, when the rain comes and the drought breaks, our farmers and our agricultural industry needs thriving regional communities to build the recovery. The government understands the challenges of regional Australia. We stand with our farmers. We stand shoulder to shoulder with affected communities until those essential rains come.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and the Public Service (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by Senators Cameron and Sterle and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) today relating to the Prime Minister (Mr Morrison).</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say the responses to questions today really go to the nature of the muppet show known as the Morrison government—that is, answers that deal with questions related to the Prime Minister's fundamental lack of judgement and competence. It's really no wonder that the Prime Minister chose to use the words 'muppet show' to describe his own government, because in actuality words to this effect were used to describe his performance during his time at Tourism Australia. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen from revelations only this week is that not only was the decision to dismiss Mr Morrison from the independent agency 'unanimous by the board and the minister' but the Auditor-General described the Prime Minister's time at the helm of the agency as having 'numerous anomalies and concerns over contracts worth $184 million'. These decisions reflect a serious breach of procurement guidelines and they are significant indictments on his judgement. They show that the current Prime Minister is frankly not suited to the role. He is unable to manage an independent agency, and he has now been promoted to run the nation, regardless of the fact that he has shown an appalling lack of judgement. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is plenty of evidence around the lack of judgement in his time at Tourism Australia. We heard that today in the question that was asked by Senator Cameron to Senator Cormann today. The fact is that the entire Tourism Australia board, former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tim Fischer, the former Minister for Small Business and Tourism, Fran Bailey, and former Prime Minister Howard refused to step in and save Mr Morrison, because he was incompetent. He lacks judgement. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not only in his time in Tourism Australia. He has been the Prime Minister since 24 August. What has happened in that time? What has he shown about his competency and judgement? Obviously, we've got the issue that he raised about moving the Australian embassy. That was an issue he raised that has overwhelmingly backfired on the Prime Minister. He raised that issue, an important issue, just to try to score political points in the by-election in the seat of Wentworth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, we had the issue around Foodbank. His own colleagues came out against him on Foodbank. He's had to backflip—thankfully—on cutting that funding. He has also now been caught out around the briefing he gave the former Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, when he sent him off to Indonesia to represent the government. He got caught out telling a different story than Mr Turnbull told. He had to backtrack on that. And we have his bus—his bus that is going around the country, but he's not on it. He gets on and off just for the photo opportunity. He's flying around. And, of course, who could forget the hip-hop song that he had to come out and apologise for: 'Scott Morrison removes cringe-worthy social media video over inappropriate rap lyrics.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've just sat down here and gone through some of the things that this Prime Minister has done that he's had to backflip on, that he's had to apologise on. There are very many serious issues that the Prime Minister just doesn't get. He's got an appalling lack of judgement, not only around the Great Barrier Reef and the grant that was given—he's taken responsibility for that as well—but we all know that he was Minister for Social Services for less than 10 months. He really must go. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:10</span>):  It fascinates me that the party of Latham, Rudd, Gillard, Rudd, Shorten and almost Albanese wants to open up a discussion about competency in leadership. Take nothing I say as a reflection on Prime Minister Morrison. Fifteen years you've waited to raise an issue so compelling that it dominates everything in your debate at the moment. It just shows, as is always the case when these lightweight attacks come from the Australian Labor Party, that they've got nothing else substantive to talk about. Question time is that valuable time in this place that allows the opposition—in this case, the Australian Labor Party—to highlight and explore critical issues to this nation around the economy, around social services, around support we're putting in place for agriculture. What do they choose to take that time up with? What do they choose to spend time on in the take note opportunity? They choose such a featherweight issue on events that have not occupied their minds for 13 years and, suddenly, are now writ large. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you why they're attacking Prime Minister Morrison. They realise the risk that Mr Shorten and the Labor Party face at the next election on the question of competency. Mr Morrison secured our borders after years and years and years of neglect—hundreds of thousands of arrivals, 1,200 people. It always fascinates me that, when we're talking about matters of national security and security of our borders, the Labor Party never once mentioned that their policy directly led to the loss of life of 1,200 individuals, many of whose names will never be known—men, women and children. And you want to have a discussion about competency? Your current leader was in your leadership team at the time those policies were in place. Prime Minister Morrison came along and fixed it, and fixed it good. He resecured the borders of this nation to this day. We inherited the legacy of Manus and Nauru, and there's an enormous amount of effort put in by you featherweights and those in the Greens to try and plaster this current administration with the event of children in custody in Nauru and the other centre. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, if you want to have a discussion about competency, I'll have the discussion with you every day, and so will everyone from the coalition. We'll talk about competency to run the economy. The Prime Minister, no matter what happens in the future, will be remembered for arresting the deficiencies that came with the deficits that you left us with—structural deficits that have gone on for years—and future deficits. He will take credit for arresting that and returning us to surplus, along with the efforts of our current leader in the Senate. So, if you want to have a talk about competency in relation to Prime Minister Morrison, we're just the right people. If you want to talk about the honesty of Prime Minister Morrison, let's have a discussion about Shorten and Gillard and all the very dark allegations that remain writ large and have never been answered about their conduct back in the trade union movement—building houses, materials, donations going—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  I too rise to take note of answers to Senator Cameron's question and to put some more contemporary facts on the table. I accept that the coalition is attempting to say that this was all so long ago that it's not relevant and it doesn't matter. But I think it's entirely superficial to say that what happened in those times is no longer relevant. If you go to the record of the parliament, you will find that the Select Committee on the Recent Allegations relating to Conditions and Circumstances at the Regional Processing Centre in Nauru found a glaring example of the lack of governance and due diligence of this particular minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Government in the Senate, sitting at the table today, was the only person, as the Minister for Finance, who was able to grant an expediency motion to the department of immigration to authorise the expenditure outside the public works committee of this parliament. That never, ever happened. There was no expediency motion through the House of Representatives. There was an incredible amount of expenditure in Nauru which did not go through the proper probity and governance of the parliament. Minister Morrison walked straight around the oldest standing committee of the parliament. And, when the department was asked about it, they conflated this view that 'it's aid to a foreign country and we don't have to refer it'. That was a subterfuge; that was not correct. If that is correct, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade do not have to notify when they're building a new embassy in Nairobi, in Jakarta or in Bangkok, and we know that they do all of those things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Morrison spent, over a period of his early ministership, $1.3 billion in Nauru. Four hundred and fifty million dollars was spent in 10 months; $2,000 was spent per day per asylum seeker; $1.3 million was spent a day; and $610,000 per asylum seeker was spent to live in a mouldy tent. No, I take that back—it was a marquee. But, after 402 days, it was a mouldy tent. If that expenditure of $36 million to build those mouldy tents had gone through the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, proper probity and scrutiny would have probably ensured that that wasn't a really good idea—to take people in the tropics, akin to Darwin, and stick them for 402 days in a mouldy tent at the cost of $36 million. It's detrimental to their health and detrimental to the people who are looking after them in that area. It was really poor governance and due diligence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't stop there. They went and spent hand over fist, citing urgency and citing expediency but not following the due diligence for probity of parliament. None of it went through the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. The government response to that Senate select committee was, 'The department provided a response to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 14 August 2015.' That was a letter saying, 'We've got this legal advice that we don't have to come your way.' The next part is, 'The department will continue to ensure that future public works in the Republic of Nauru are referred.' So there's a clear example of this person purporting to be an exemplar of due diligence—an exemplar of public probity and governance hasn't got clean hands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the earlier parliament—the first parliament when they came in—they had a clear example from the Gillard-Rudd government where an expediency motion granted by the finance minister passed through the House of Representatives, and there was feedback to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on progress. They didn't do any of that. It is as simple as this: they didn't realise that, because the old parliament had lapsed, they had to do the process again. So, in the process they were supposed to do in their rush to do whatever, they didn't follow due process. That relates directly back to Prime Minister Morrison. It's never been rebutted in this place. This speech is in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. It was never rebutted by the finance minister. It was never rebutted by any of those on the other side. It stands to be true.</span>

And boy, haven't we seen where the real power, the real authority, the real skill is—I'm stretching it a bit there. The real skill is not in the Australian Senate for the Australian Labor Party; it might be in the House of Representatives.

                  </a>  Senator Brown, I thought your contribution was particularly lacklustre. You were trying to undermine the credibility of the Prime Minister—the evidence is there and I'll come to it in a moment—on what was a very successful marketing campaign aimed at encouraging visitors to Australia. It was so successful that Kevin Rudd, when he was the opposition leader, said it was 'great'; you won't be surprised to learn that, when he became the Prime Minister, he changed his tune. I will just take people back down memory lane for a bit. This was the 'Where the bloody hell are you?' marketing campaign. It featured an outback pub, fireworks on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and a bikini-clad young woman called Lara Bingle. It was successful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cormann has drawn to the attention of the Senate in his contribution today that this campaign contributed an additional $2.1 billion to the tourism industry's bottom line over 2006-07. He also shared with the Senate that the Australian National Audit Office itself has said that the accounts were found to be a true and fair view of its final position. Senator Cormann said that the Prime Minister, in his role at Tourism Australia, met all the requirements and that people were fully satisfied. The number of nights stayed by international visitors increased by 12 per cent as a result of the marketing campaign. The tourism spend in Australia increased by 10 per cent, and there was an increase of three per cent in the economic value of inbound tourism to $18.8 billion. Having presided over the Tourism Australia 'Where the bloody hell are you?' campaign is a demonstration—not a criticism—of the Prime Minister's acumen. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard a lot over the last two days about what Tim Fischer, the former Deputy Prime Minister, had to say. What did Tim Fischer have to say? You'll have to trawl back through the archives, but on 26 July 2006, in an article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span>, he praised Mr Morrison's performance. He said: 'I acknowledge the dedicated contribution Scott Morrison has made to Tourism Australia—in particular, with the development and launch of the new international marketing campaign.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lacklustre and dispirited—that is the way Labor has prosecuted a very lame attempt at trying to undermine the community's confidence in the Prime Minister. So you might well ask yourself: where the bloody hell have you been? I know where the coalition has been. It's been out there developing and implementing a campaign for personal income tax reduction. It's been out there building confidence in the Australian economy. It's been out there driving economic growth in our country. It's been out there negotiating with the states and territories for a fairer share of the GST, a deal that no-one thought could be done. That is a deal that not only rewards Western Australia and corrects the great anomaly in regard to the GST issue but also benefits every state and territory. I know where the coalition has been; it has been out there working and building confidence in the Australian economy for families and for small businesses.</span>

You've been building a plan for slower economic growth. You've been building a plan to dismantle all of the economic growth and prosperity that this country has seen over many, many years. That's where you've been. You'll have to lift your game. The House of Representatives will be back in a few days time. You've got a chance. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  I also rise to take note of the answers from the Minister representing the Prime Minister in question time today. The answers by the minister in question time today cannot disguise the repeated lack of judgement and transparency shown by the current Prime Minister. His lack of judgement has been on display for all to see since the leadership coup against Malcolm Turnbull. It was on display in his previous role as minister and it was there during his tenure as head of Tourism Australia. The Prime Minister has done his best to try to hide the details of his sacking from Tourism Australia and the reasons for his dismissal. Apparently we're meant to believe that he was supremely competent. We don't know if his sacking was because of maladministration. We don't know if his sacking was because he was seen as a malcontent. We don't know if his sacking was because of a cringe-worthy campaign. Maybe it was because he was spending too much time doing the numbers. What we do know is that, in the words of the minister at the time, 'it was a unanimous decision to get rid of Mr Morrison by the board and the minister.' It was a decision that was backed by the Prime Minister, John Howard. We also know that nothing less than the Auditor-General's report from that time outlined information being kept from the board, government procurement guidelines being breached and contracts of up to $184 million being awarded to private companies without any assessment of value for money. It all sounds way too familiar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that the Prime Minister's approach to our relationship with our neighbours might also appear by some to be cringe-worthy and lacking judgement. The declaration in the days before the Wentworth by-election, that Australia would consider moving our embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, showed a complete and utter disregard for the sensitivities of one of our most important relationships—that with our largest neighbour, Indonesia—and all in a vain attempt to win a by-election. Well, we know how that worked out. It's not surprising that this thought bubble burst as soon as the polls closed in Wentworth. But the damage had been done, and it's clear that this is impacting on our trade relationship, as reported in the news today. We know that this is true. What we also know is that Australians deserve the opportunity that the Tourism Australia board and the former Minister for Tourism had all those years ago at Tourism Australia: the opportunity to terminate the Prime Minister's employment by going to an early election.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next week in Papua New Guinea APEC is meeting. On the way to the APEC meeting, the Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, has been invited to come to Australia. I understand he'll be in Darwin on Friday and he will be having a meeting with the Prime Minister, Mr Scott Morrison, and other dignitaries. It has been reported that he will be visiting bombing sites from World War II and possibly a war memorial to Australians who perished from Japanese bombings. Once again, this has been reported as an opportunity for two friends to develop closer bonds and, of course, for discussions around regional cooperation, regional security arrangements and defence ties. It will start in Darwin and will continue through to APEC.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make it very clear that this week—three weeks early—the Japanese whaling fleet has departed for the Southern Ocean to kill 333 minke whales. It's three weeks early. I've been monitoring the Japanese whaling fleet for many years. Is it a coincidence that it's left in the same week as their Prime Minister is coming to Australia, seemingly for a PR opportunity—a photo shoot—talking about what great friends we are with Japan? Last January, the Prime Minister at the time, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, also flew to Japan and had a photo shoot with Mr Shinzo Abe. They also discussed regional security initiatives, regional ties and both economic and defence cooperation when he was in Tokyo. Not 24 hours after he left Tokyo, the Japanese government put out an announcement that they were going to aggressively expand their whaling fleet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know from speaking to a reporter in Japan that comment was sought from environment groups in mid-December 2016 about that expansion, but the Japanese government sat on that announcement until 24 hours after Mr Turnbull left. Why are we rolling out the red carpet for the Japanese Prime Minister for a friendship visit to Australia in the same week that they are sending their whaling fleet to the Southern Ocean? This is an issue of critical importance to Australians. They care deeply about whaling in the Southern Ocean.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Respective governments have taken action through the International Court of Justice and through the International Whaling Commission. Respective governments, including the Liberal government, have run election policies that they would send a Customs vessel or a naval vessel to mirror the Japanese fleet while they went down into the Southern Ocean, to let them know that Australians were watching them and that they weren't happy. So why are we presenting this opportunity to the Japanese government for a photo shoot and some PR spin? Will the Prime Minister make this issue one that he raises directly with the Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm getting sick and tired of coming in here every year and talking about the Japanese fleet going to the Southern Ocean, banging on about how unhappy Australians are and calling on the government to take some action when nothing ever happens. I think I speak on behalf of the majority of Australians when I say this: we don't want the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean this summer. We don't want them to go back. We don't want them to expand commercial whaling rapidly, which is what they're trying to do through the International Whaling Commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just a month ago, the Japanese government led a massive push. Senator Ruston, who is in the chamber now, was there representing Australia. It was a massive push to resume commercial whaling. Now, while that was defeated, they did say that they were disappointed and that they were considering their options. That did significant reputational damage to Japan. The whole world watched on in disgust as they tried to push for a resumption of full commercial whaling. Why are we giving them a chance to adjust that reputational damage this Friday in Darwin without at least our Prime Minister and our foreign minister making a statement about the whaling fleet leaving last night, disappointingly, for yet another summer of slaughter in the Southern Ocean?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Greg Hunt once said in this place to the previous Labor environment minister, Mr Peter Garrett, 'Labor have a blind eye in Canberra and we have blood in the Southern Ocean.' What has the Liberal Party done about whaling in the five years that they've been in government? Absolutely nothing! They broke their election promise; they never sent a Customs vessel. This is an opportunity for them to send a message to Japan, both on Friday in Darwin, to let them know very clearly that Australians think this is unacceptable, and to send a Customs vessel this summer to monitor the activities of the Japanese whaling fleet.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education (Senator Cash) to a question without notice asked by Senator Watt today relating to a raid by the Australian Federal Police on the offices of the Australian Workers Union.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today in question time we learned a couple of things in the never-ending saga of Senator Cash and her involvement and her office's involvement in the police raids on AWU offices. We learned shortly before question time, through media reports, that, finally, her former chief of staff has now been served with a subpoena to appear in court and give evidence as to his knowledge of the police raids on union offices. We also learned from those media reports that it actually took private investigators being hired in order to track him down and serve him with those documents. He, of course, is not the only person who seems to have been in hiding over this entire affair. Senator Cash herself has a history of hiding from providing information to the Senate and to the public about her involvement in this affair, most particularly her infamous appearance behind whiteboards before a Senate estimates hearing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Senator Cash was asked about this today, she claimed not to know about this. I sat here thinking, 'When have I heard this before from Senator Cash?' Of course, it goes back to the very beginning of this affair, when she came into estimates and repeatedly told the Senate that she didn't know anything and her office didn't know anything about the leaking of the information to the media about the police raid. Her staff didn't tell her—that's what she told us at the time. Again here today we have Senator Cash telling the Senate that she doesn't know about media reports that her former chief of staff has been served with a subpoena. Forgive me if I'm a little bit sceptical about Senator Cash. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do know, though, is that Senator Cash herself has been served with a subpoena to appear in court and give evidence. It's about time she fronted up. Instead, she's instructed her taxpayer funded lawyers to challenge the subpoena. She needs to front up and explain her knowledge.</span>

                    </a>  The Greens support this motion. There should be no political interference in research grants, full stop. The Liberals need to back off on the so-called national interest test, which is just a smoke-screen for inserting political priorities into the independent research approval process. What's truly in the national interest is for academics to continue the centuries-old tried and tested process of peer review. I do encourage Labor to go one step further and support my bill to remove all ministerial veto from research grants, to listen to universities and the academic community and to send a clear signal to academics and experts that they can be trusted to make research decisions, no matter who the government is.</span>

                    </a>  The former minister for education, Senator Birmingham, did not explain why he vetoed 11 grant applications for humanities and social science research projects recommended by the ARC. He still has not done so, apart from sneering at project titles. The applicants only found out what happened when the ARC confirmed the former minister's decisions at Senate estimates. They are all eminent scholars, but the arbitrary rejection of their work affects their reputations and career prospects. The present minister, Mr Tehan, has proposed a national interest test for applicants, without explaining why a further test is needed beyond that already contained in the application process. As all the research community has recognised, political interference threatens the independence and integrity of the peer review grants process. It is an established principle that politicians should not decide on funding of individual grant projects. The government should recommit and prevent further harm to the standing of Australia's research institutions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Labor agrees with parts (a) to (d) of this motion and would also like to recognise the importance of regional tourism, commend Outback Queensland Tourism and congratulate all category winners of the 2018 Outback Queensland Tourism Awards. However, Labor opposes part (e) of this motion as the Tourism 2020 strategy was in fact an important initiative of the former federal Labor government. Moreover, the current coalition government has only cancelled programs aimed at supporting tourism. It cancelled the T-QUAL program and the Tourism Industry Regional Development Fund upon coming into office. So we ask that this motion be split. </span>

To be resettled in the United States is a dream for most of the world's refugees. We know that because the United Nations Refugee Agency reports that the United States under President Trump is the most requested country of resettlement in the world.</span>

                    </a>  Mr President, I seek your guidance. It's a matter of relevance. I understand that Senator Hanson is making a statement by leave of the Senate. I was very happy to be part of the Senate providing her leave if her statement were relevant in any way to the question before the Senate. It's not, so I ask your advice as to whether I can now deny leave to Senator Hanson.</span>

In my view, once leave is granted for a statement to be made, leave has been granted and a point of order on relevance to something that might normally be before the chamber, like a bill under debate, is not relevant. This is a matter senators will have to take into account. Any senator, of course, can object to the granting of leave. Senator Hanson, I call you to continue.</span>

                  </a>  In moving this motion, I need to point out that it is in my capacity as a senator for the Justice Party and not in my position as Chair of the National Redress Scheme committee. I'm doing it, to steal from Gough Whitlam, because it's time—it's actually past time. Institutions named in this motion are dragging the chain—some, I suspect, deliberately. Several thousand applications have been lodged, but fewer than 10 have been settled. Cases are on hold and ageing survivors are dying without their redress. It wasn't too complicated for church branches to use the umbrella system for the royal commission. Surely that is a blueprint for how redress should be addressed now. We've used the carrot; it's time for the stick.</span>

                  </a>  The Australian community, our trading partners, our producers and our exporters all need clarity and certainty about the management of live animal exports, in particular how the welfare of animals is ensured in the export supply chain. Australians also need to be able to have confidence in the independent regulation of the live export industry and certainty that the regulator will hold that industry to account. The government has strengthened the regulation and oversight of the live export trade. This includes accepting all recommendations of the McCarthy and Moss reviews, the establishment of an independent inspector-general of live animal exports, appointing a principal regulatory officer, re-establishing an animal welfare branch and developing animal welfare indicators as part of the regulatory framework. This work is already underway. The government intends to respond to the Productivity Commission report by the end of 2018—noting, however, that the scope of the Australian commission for animal welfare as proposed goes beyond the constitutional responsibility and authority of the Commonwealth.</span>

Whilst we agree with the sentiment of the motion with regards to failings of the current government in the regulation of the export of live sheep, the establishment of inspector-general of live animal exports must be the priority of the government as identified in the Moss review. This is a position abolished by the former agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce. The inspector-general should be tasked with reviewing the recommendations of the Productivity Commission in relation to the possibility of establishing an Australian commission for animal welfare.</span>

                  </a>  I thank Senator Storer for bringing this motion to the Senate. The Greens will be supporting this because we do need an independent office of animal welfare to drive policy and to protect animals. There is a huge conflict of interest when animal welfare issues are regulated by agriculture departments. The recent Moss review into live exports shows what a mess all this is. The government is quite happy to sit by and watch animals suffer, including increasing stock densities and live export ships against the advice of the Australian Veterinary Association. Neither Labor nor Liberal have the courage to take on the cruelty in the greyhound racing industry or to end the most cruel intense farming practices. Only an independent office of animal welfare removed from the conflicts of interest is the way to achieve this.</span>

It is important that changes in this area improve upon the current system rather than adding complexity and confusion. In contrast, the opposition has made a policy announcement about a federal anticorruption commission with absolutely no detail of how it will work. Calling by motion for a commitment to the establishment of an organisation without any detail whatsoever as to the jurisdictional powers or legal and administrative operation of that organisation is not a sound policy approach.</span>

                    </a>  It's now almost a year since the Senate select committee report on cancers with low survival rates was tabled. In September I wrote to the Minister for Health, Mr Hunt, to remind him that the government's response to the report is well overdue. I received the minister's response a month ago, which anticipated that the government's response would be finalised in the coming weeks. I'm disappointed that it is still not forthcoming, and I hope we will see it soon. Over 300 submissions were received by the committee, and 117 witnesses appeared at public hearings, many of whom bravely fought back tears to tell their personal stories. I'm still waiting to hear how the government intends to address a number of important recommendation of the report, including that low-survival-rate cancers be identified as one of the National Health and Medical Research Council's national health priorities and the development of an Australia-wide strategy to increase the survival rate of these cancers to 50 per cent by 2027, as well as various recommendations to improve patients' access to clinical trials. Patients with cancers with low survival rates are looking for hope. By failing to respond to this report, this government is denying them the hope they so desperately seek and deserve. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="AI6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  If ever there was a clear difference between this rabble of a government, this government that their own Prime Minister called the muppets, this government that their former Prime Minister calls mad, then it's the position Labor is taking on standing up for workers and their families. What we have said clearly is that we will restore the penalty rates of 700,000 workers across this country. These are some of the poorest and most disadvantaged workers in the country. What we have seen has been a process of pressurising the Fair Work Commission. There was minister after minister of this coalition government who stood up and said we needed more flexibility on penalty rates. We had member after member of the coalition government talking about the need to get into a modern economy and get rid of penalty rates. The pressure was put on publicly by this government and by business. Unfortunately, the Fair Work Commission made an amazing blunder by taking penalty rates away from some of the poorest workers in this country. Labor will restore those penalty rates because we understand how important penalty rates are to working families across this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I first came to Australia in 1973, as a maintenance fitter, without my penalty rates I would not have been able to put food on the table, pay the rent and look after my family. It was my penalty rates that actually put me in a position to be able to pay the rent in Kingsford in Sydney, which was pretty high by any standard, and then put food on the table and actually do a little bit for my family to get ahead. It was penalty rates that did it. Without penalty rates, I would have been in all sorts of trouble. My basic wage in those days was $87 a week and I was paying $50 a week in rent. It was my penalty rates that allowed me to actually live a basic life, a decent life, when I first came to Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a problem for 700,000 workers across this country. I can't believe that the National Party would have been party to this push against penalty rates, because in many regional economies—and I was in Albury-Wodonga recently and down in Bega the week before last—working people were saying they're doing it tough and small businesses were saying they're doing it tough. When the money from the penalty rates comes out of our local economies, businesses do it tough. We are saying we will restore penalty rates. There are good economic reasons to do it, there are good social reasons to do it and there are reasons of fairness in this country. So we will restore penalty rates. This is Labor standing up for workers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will also provide a tax break to workers at the lower end of earnings in this country. We'll provide a tax break of up to $1,063 per annum. That's in sharp contrast to the coalition, who wanted to hand $80 billion to the big end of town in tax cuts and wanted to hand $12 billion in tax cuts to the banks. How crazy can you get? How ideologically driven can you get that when workers are doing it tough, when workers are having their penalty rates cut, you want to hand billions of dollars over to the banks and the big end of town?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've said that we'll crack down on dodgy labour hire companies. Labour hire companies are still out there forcing workers onto individual contracts. They are forcing workers who are not self-employed into self-employed positions. That is unacceptable. The labour hire companies that are out there behaving badly need to be brought under some control and under some regulation. We need workers to get a fair go if they're working for a labour hire company. Labour hire companies should be registered so that we know only legitimate labour hire companies are going to operate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to ensure that Australian workers get access to jobs and are not replaced by overseas workers on 457 visas unnecessarily. Labor has always taken the view that there is a need for overseas labour. I am a product of Labor's previous policies of bringing workers in from overseas, but I came into this country as a permanent migrant and I think I brought some skills, through my trade, to this country, and that is a legitimate position. But now we've seen 457 visas being used unnecessarily. Under the mining boom, sure, there was a massive increase in the number of 457 visas. That's because the country needed those skills. Now that we don't need those skills as much as we did, there should not be the use of 457 visas unnecessarily. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Workers are not getting their fair share in this country. We've had decades of economic growth in this country. But what is it for workers? Stagnating wages. You hear all these arguments about jobs being created. It's not the coalition that's created the jobs; it's business that has created these jobs. Business has created these jobs, but the workers are not getting a pay rise. The workers are not getting a cent more. Workers' wages are stagnating, and that is a massive problem for the living standards of working families. Their standards of living are declining. They're battling to pay their mortgage; they're battling to pay their rent. Many, many workers can't afford to go on a modest holiday in this country. They're cutting back on small luxuries. Battling workers can't take their kids to the movies. They can't send their kids on school excursions. Once in a blue moon, they might be able to get a takeaway—that's a luxury for many working people in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's so far from the reality of the coalition members, who are living a life that many workers do not understand and could never contemplate. Yet these people on a $200,000-a-year basic wage are saying to workers: 'You must get rid of your penalty rates. Your wages should stagnate. Just believe in us and somehow you'll get a pay increase.' It's absolute ideological nonsense from this government. Workers are battling to pay their electricity bills. After five years of this coalition, there is no certainty for investment in the power industry. That's because you've got the extremists on the other side who don't believe in climate change, who are simply trying to push an extreme ideological agenda on this country that has left investment in renewables stagnating. Investment in renewables should be massively growing, as every modern economy is looking to do. This is a position of: we need a consistent policy. The coalition are incapable of providing a consistent policy on power and on climate change, and that means that workers are paying the price. It's because of the incompetence and lack of policy from the coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Private health care is beyond the reach of the majority of low-paid workers. They can't afford private health care. These prices are going up more and more. This is just another example of the problems for working people. The Centre for Future Work have done an analysis. They've looked at it, and they've come up with a view that workers are getting about $16,800 less pay a year due to the labour share of the gross domestic product declining. More money is going to the big end of town, more money is going to employers and less money is coming to workers. That has resulted in a $16,800-a-year less share of the economy for every worker. The OECD has seen the highest incidence of temporary work. CEO remuneration as a multiple of medium wages in Australia was 15 to one. It is now 180 to one over a 40-year period. The big end of town is doing okay; executives are doing okay. Workers' wages are stagnating. The government have got no answers; the government are on their last legs. No wonder that their own people describe them as 'muppets' and as 'mad', because they are the 'M and Ms'. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  That last speech should have been finished with the words, 'Written, spoken and authorised by the ACTU.' That's because, really, that is all that the Senate has been subjected to—the nonsense of the lobotomised zombies. Senator Cameron himself described his colleagues in the Labor Party as 'lobotomised zombies'. They're not my words but Senator Cameron's words, and how true they are a descriptor of not only the Labor Party but also, of course, Senator Cameron himself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at the facts. First of all, let's go to the very end of the motion or proposition put forward by Senator Cameron. It's about cracking down on dodgy labour hire 457 visas. All I would ask the Australian people listening to this debate to do is look at what Labor does, not at what Labor says. That's because when Mr Shorten was the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, 457 visas grew from 48,000 to 68,486. The coalition came to government, and within the first year we were able to peal it back to around about 52,000. Today, it stands at 12,000, which is about 20 per cent of what Mr Shorten presided over. Yet we have the audacity of an Australian Labor Party frontbencher coming into this place suggesting that our 80 per cent reduction of 457 visas from when Mr Shorten was the responsible minister to now is somehow a great discredit to us, because Senator Cameron and the Labor Party protect workers. I don't think so. Their record speaks so much louder than their rhetoric today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is this Liberal-National Party government that promised to create, through economic stimulus, an extra one million jobs in this country if we were to have been elected in 2013. We were ridiculed by the ACTU. We were ridiculed by their senators in this place for making such an assertion. We came in on that promise well before time. And, indeed, we have been able, through our economic stimulus, to assist the private sector to create, in one year alone, 400,000 new jobs for our fellow Australians. That is 400,000 households that today are able to be self-sufficient, which otherwise they would not have been. We all know that the benefit of employment is better mental health, better physical health, better self-esteem and better social interaction. The social good of employment, I would argue, nearly outweighs the economic benefits of employment. This is the social good and the economic good that we as a government have been able to deliver. That is why the welfare bill in this country has been able to be reduced, because the best form of welfare is the provision of employment. That is what we as a government have sought to deliver. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to my home state of Tasmania, when the Greens-Labor government was in power with Mr Shorten as a minister, the unemployment rate in my home state was 8.1 per cent. Today, it is below six per cent. That means thousands of my fellow Tasmanians have been taken off the welfare system and gone into employment, where they have self-sufficiency and where they have certainty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now let me expose the monstrous lie that the ACTU and the Australian Labor Party seek to peddle about penalty rates. Penalty rates have not been abolished. Penalty rates in four awards were reduced, not by the government but by Mr Bill Shorten's handpicked Fair Work commissioners. They made the decision, five Fair Work commissioners, and they were all appointed by the Australian Labor Party government under legislation that Mr Shorten deliberately amended prior to the demise of the Labor-Greens government, forcing the Fair Work Commission to have a look at penalty rates on a regular basis. So who's the architect of the reduction of penalty rates in these four awards? None other than Mr Bill Shorten of the Australian Labor Party. Yet they have the audacity to come in here and seek to claim, and blame, the coalition for a decision made by the Australian Labor Party's mates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even worse, when Mr Shorten was asked on radio if he would accept the decision of the independent umpire—and that is what the Fair Work Commission is; you have to accept their decisions—Mr Shorten was asked: 'Will you accept their findings, given this is an independent body assessing penalty rates for Sunday, if you're Prime Minister?' Mr Shorten: 'Yes.' Neil Mitchell: 'You'll accept them?' Bill Shorten: 'Yes.' Neil Mitchell: 'Even if they reduce Sunday penalty rates?' Bill Shorten: 'Well, I said I would accept the independent tribunal.' That is what Mr Shorten said he would do. Now, for cheap political opportunism, he has changed his mind. So I say to my fellow Australians who might be concerned about their penalty rates: this is the man that engineered your reduction in penalty rates. He is the man that then said that he would 'accept the decision if it were to reduce your penalty rates'. And today, hand on heart, he says, 'Believe me, I'm going to change it'—when he was the one who ensured this reduction in penalty rates would actually occur. Mr Shorten was the architect. He is responsible. He needs to bear the blame. And it is the height of audacity, the height of duplicity, the height of speaking with a forked tongue, for the Australian Labor Party to come to this chamber and assert that somehow the coalition are responsible for a reduction in penalty rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But why did Labor's hand-picked Fair Work commissioners come to the determination that it might be a good idea to reduce Sunday penalty rates in a few areas? Because they accepted that it mitigated against the prospect of employment for our other fellow Australians. And so the Fair Work Commission said that, if you were to reduce the Sunday penalty rates by a relatively small margin, it would create extra employment opportunities. Senator Cameron, the ACTU and the Labor Party will never talk about the 400,000 jobs that have been created in recent times, because they know the economic policies we have pursued and the reality that made the Fair Work Commissioners come to the decision that the penalty rates regime was costing jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we are with an extra 400,000 Australians in employment. Under an Australian Labor Party government, going by their record—not what they say but what they actually do—we would have another 50,000 or so 457 visa holders displacing Australian workers and we would undoubtedly have more of our fellow Australians unemployed. When it comes to looking after workers, the Liberal-National Party record shows that it has not amended the legislation—like Mr Shorten did— and did not appoint the commissioners that led to the reduction in penalty rates. In fact, we are the party that has presided over 400,000 more jobs in Australia in just one year and the creation of over one million jobs since we came to government. More importantly, we have seen the shattering of the 457 visas that were given to people by 80 per cent compared to when Mr Shorten was in government. So the party for the workers is in fact the Liberal-National Party government, which has a record—unlike Labor, which only has rhetoric.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  As Senator Cameron would recall, One Nation supported his fair work amendment bill in 2017 to protect take-home pay and penalty rates for Australian workers. It would appear that the Labor Party either has a short memory of my support and the support of all One Nation senators or these are disgraceful untruths designed to discredit One Nation because we're having a huge impact on your vote in blue-collar regions like Capricornia, Maranoa, Herbert and other electorates across the country. The hypocrisy of Labor is laughable, when you say Labor is protecting Aussie jobs and weekend penalty rates. The Labor Party happily undermined Australian workers less than a month ago by supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP-11. This free trade agreement has given away at least 5,000 Australian jobs to countries like Mexico, whose workers are prepared to slave their guts out for $6.07 a day. Under the TPP-11, passed by Labor and the coalition, you gave away Australian jobs to Vietnamese workers who don't mind working for $2.70 a day in their home country. Honestly, Labor sicken me with their hypocrisy and cock-and-bull stories about being a party for the workers. I'm sorry, but you've never been a party for the workers. These days the Labor Party are about themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What credibility Labor had left as a party went up in smoke last month when they all voted in favour of the TPP-11 free trade agreement. Let me read you a little excerpt from a letter I just received yesterday from the national secretary of the Construction Forestry Maritime Mining and Energy Union, Michael O'Connor. I think the Deputy President and my Senate colleagues know who I'm referring to here. He's not only the big boss of the CFMEU but also the brother of Labor's shadow minister for employment and workplace relations, Brendan O'Connor. Listen to what the CFMEU national secretary says to me in his letter. It's very kind. I almost blushed when I first read it. For the sake of our snowflake Labor members, I'm giving you a trigger warning just in case you want to block your ears. Here we go. Just remember these are words from Michael O'Connor, the national secretary of the CFMEU: 'Dear Senator, I write to you to firstly acknowledge your efforts and thank you for the principled position that you took by voting against the enabling legislation for the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, TPP-11. The TPP was and is bad for workers and bad for the country.' This is Michael O'Connor writing to me. The CFMEU national secretary then says: 'The A Fair Go for Australians in Trade Bill 2018 is due to, in no small part, One Nation's great work.' Isn't it lovely of the CFMEU's national secretary to write to little old me, Pauline Hanson?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't believe the Construction Forestry Maritime Mining and Energy Union is telling me One Nation is the best friend workers have in Australia—not Labor. What a kick in the guts to Labor. How do you feel? You sold out the CFMEU and their members, for what? I'll say it again: One Nation is officially the best friend to workers, and I've got it in writing from the biggest union in this country. The CFMEU says, 'One Nation takes a principled stand on jobs in this country.' That sounds to me like the national secretary of the CFMEU is saying, 'Labor don't have principles, but One Nation does.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Already Mark Latham has joined One Nation as state leader ahead of the New South Wales state elections. Labor better get used to more One Nation members being elected across every state in this country. We are, as the CFMEU say, principled. I welcome anyone who shares my support of Australian jobs to join me as we fight the two failed parties who continue to sell out workers in this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  Can I just ask Senator Hanson and Senator Georgiou to hang around. I'm not going to have a crack at you. I think there's something else you need to hear, while you're being the best friends of workers. I would request your support on what I'm going to talk about now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're worried about 457-class visas, but let me tell you there's a bigger plague in this nation. Border protection are very well aware of this, because of the road safety inquiry that I chaired three years ago—I think that was when we put it up. Senator Williams is very supportive of our concerns here, because I wrote a report that was bipartisan. He's my co-chair. He's my partner in the work that we did here. I'll tell you where the problem is. The problem we have in this nation is the exploitation of the foreign visa system. This is where we really have to start concentrating. It should come as, and would not come as, a surprise in this chamber here that this started. There was an incident on the M5—I believe it's the highway in Sydney that goes under the airport—where a K&amp;S B-double, on a Friday evening, pulled up. It shouldn't have been on there. It was over height. It couldn't get under the bridge. Fortunately, it's a very rare occurrence because most of our truckies are very well trained and traversed in where they should be and where they shouldn't be. The problem was that, when the RMS turned up and the police turned up, there were two drivers in the cab. One wouldn't get out of the cab and the other one got out and said that, between the pair of them, they couldn't back out the B-double. For those who aren't trucking operators like me, part of your training is having to actually back the bucket of nuts and bolts out. You have to be able to do that. You have to be able to couple it all up and take it off safely without it falling apart. Not only could they not back out the B-double but they couldn't uncouple the B-double so they could do a U-turn. We're talking about a company—K&amp;S—that was one of the most respected companies in Australia when it was under the ownership of Allan Scott, a very, very decent employer. The RMS had to uncouple it while one driver refused to get out. Both of the drivers weren't Australian drivers; they were from overseas. Before anyone has a crack at me, I've made it very clear: this is not about attacking people from overseas; it's about attacking the mongrels who exploit our visa system, and they happen to be of the same race. They get them here, offer them a house and say, 'If you open your mouth, you're out and you're deported back.' That was bad enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What made it worse was that, when Senator O'Sullivan and I wrote to RMS and the police and asked, 'What happened when the truck was put back together?' they said they waved them goodbye and wished them safe travel to where they were going. The good folk of RMS and the police were only operating under the crappy laws they have in New South Wales. The minister at the time went missing. It was a man, and he got the 'big A', and then a woman took over. It was the same woman who thinks you should put electric shocks through steering wheels to keep truck drivers awake. I'm not making this stuff up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, lo and behold, I was in Sydney last week. I had the pleasure of being with 500 transport workers at the TWU's New South Wales conference. There were 500 men and women in that room from all facets of the transport industry, whether it be road transport, warehousing, aviation or buses—it didn't matter; they all had the same objective: they want to be safe and they want other road users to be safe. That's great. I was informed of an accident at a place called Fairy Meadow. They tell me that Fairy Meadow is on the way to Wollongong. I don't know. But, to cut a long story short, there's a big hill, and a rigid truck came along at 7 o'clock in the morning. The rigid truck driver was a foreign truck driver. Anyway, the brakes failed through an intersection. Thank Christ, no-one was killed. He ploughed into a McDonald's car park. Can you imagine that, at 7 o'clock in the morning at McDonald's? Thank God, no-one was killed. There were a couple of people injured. Now Border Protection are involved because the driver, allegedly—are you ready for this; Senator Hanson, I'll need your help in the next parliament—was on a student visa. The investigation is on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This mob are called Hari Om. Try to Google them and, if you can find out who they are, please help me out. They're a massive company in India and they've got some dealings here. They have 11 trucks here in New South Wales—one smashed up, of course. RMS grabbed the other 10. Every single one of them was defected. They were defected through bald tyres, seatbelts not working and brakes not working. I spoke to the head inspector of RMS today, and he told me that, of the 10 vehicles still on the road, six of them have been grounded. Hari Om, whoever the hell they are, nearly went broke a couple of times. There are notices of proposed deregistration from ASIC that I found from 2013 and 2016. They actually do a heck of a lot of work for Toll and TNT. In fact, I'm told they do more TNT.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the biggest problems we have in this nation is chain of responsibility. Senator O'Sullivan and I wrote a magnificent report after two years of hard work. I'm running out of time. I want to be very quick. One of the recommendations we addressed said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends that, if not adequately addressed through the recommendations of the Migrant Workers' Taskforce, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection comprehensively review visa arrangements to address systematic or organised abuse in the transport industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator O'Sullivan and I addressed another recommendation, which said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends that all visa holders with heavy vehicle driving licences undergo driver skill tests before their heavy vehicle driving licences are recognised in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We said a lot more. We know there's a problem. We know that the visa system is being exploited. Like we said, we are seriously of the opinion that these poor devils are recruited from India, come over here—they may be studying something at university. They may come up with the cure for cancer—I don't know; I hope they do. They'll start doing part-time B-double operations between Brisbane and Sydney because they have nothing better to do, or drive trucks for this other company, Hari Om.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we're going to get real serious, this is the squeeze on the supply chain. Let's make this very, very clear. You're not from trucking stock, but you have worked this out. If a transport company has bald tyres, they've got foreign drivers on student visas, their brakes aren't working and the seatbelts aren't working, yet they're the third link in the supply chain—no, they're the fourth. There's the customer, whoever the customers are. I'd love to know whose freight they're carting, because I'd love to contact the company and say, 'Did you know your freight's on the back of these buckets of crap?' That's the first thing I'd love to know. Then there's the transport company, being TNT—I'm told TNT is one of the worst, with this Hari Om. I'm ex-TNT, so that wouldn't surprise me. I became a unionist because of TNT, not because I was born one. They made me one, so I'm not going to let TNT off the hook. Then you have this other transport company—and I've spoken to the manager today—DSE, who subcontracts to the Indian, Hari Om. There are four in the supply chain, so what the heck are these people being paid, for crying out loud? Hari Om is exploiting the visa system, putting dangerous vehicles out on the road and trying to dodge the TWU. The TWU are now doing the investigation. Can you believe that? Border Protection is just checking on the visa and the immigration stuff. The TWU is out there wanting the time and wages, the safety management plans and the fatigue management plans. This is not the work of the TWU; this should be the government. You can't wait to put your claws in when taxing those from the transport industry. You steal 40 cents a litre off us in the fuel tax excise; it doesn't go back into the roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson, across the chamber to you and Senator Georgiou, this is a serious problem for our nation. It's not brand new. The supply chain is being squeezed. We all have children, grandchildren or allies out on the road. We want them to be safe. We have to absolutely work together to put a system in place where you cannot squeeze the supply chain. At the end of the day, the companies have to be responsible. It's all very well having a chain of responsibility and all very well having fatigue management, but, if you turn a blind eye as soon as something like this happens—you go and whack over the couple of truck drivers and you still let that rotten system go on—what the hell are we doing in terms of road safety, let alone protecting other road users and protecting a valuable industry that, I can tell you, is really highly disregarded in this building?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is just one tiny little complaint—well, not tiny; it's not tiny. What I'm trying to say is that we wrote this report in good faith. This is a joint report from Senator O'Sullivan and myself. We presented an interim report. We tabled it on 3 May 2016. We took this damn seriously. We did a final report on October 2017. Since then, we've had three ministers. We've not even had a response to say, 'Hey, for crying out loud, not only must we make the roads safer for everyone on the roads but also, please, Border Force, get in there and tighten up on the exploitation of foreign workers.' It's not good enough to have these poor buggers being promised the world, brought out from other countries and employed by some grubby labour hire person who's from the same country who turns a blind eye—and TNT keeps employing these other ratbags.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:13</span>):  It's always a pleasure to speak on these matters of reference put forward to the chamber by the Labor Party. Unlike the other speakers, I won't concentrate a lot on what the problems are, because I've got a solution. I think we should form—and I'm talking about the penalty rates—an independent commission. That's what we should do. We should form a commission completely independent of government. No government influence or input. Sit this commission way out of arm's reach of government. We'll allow them to make the decisions to meet the national interest tests and the industry tests. They can make the decisions around workers' terms and conditions, particularly around the application of penalty rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, unfortunately for me, someone else thought of that before I did. The Australian Labor Party formed an independent commission at arm's length from government. There was no interference from government, either their government or the current coalition government. In 2009 the former Labor government put together the Fair Work Commission. That was their solution to this problem. Of course, as is the case with most things, when you've had a change of chairs, from opposition you will criticise the government of the day over these issues even though you were responsible for the architectural framework that was put in place to deal with such matters independently and completely at arm's length from the government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I realised that this wasn't an original thought, I thought I need to come up with another solution. Of course Labor's solution is to make Prime Minister the Leader of the Opposition in the other place, Mr Shorten. Surely to God he'll look after the workers. Surely to God he'll make sure that penalty rates and terms and conditions are looked after. I thought I didn't capture it with my first thought, but I've captured it with my second. Surely having Mr Shorten put in charge of terms and conditions for workers, particularly around penalty rates, will get bipartisan support. Alas, when I raised that with my staff and advisers, they said: 'Hold on a minute, big feller. There's a problem with that too.' I said, 'What's the problem with that?' They said that the last time Bill Shorten was in charge of things like enterprise bargaining agreements—and Labor senators who take an interest in this should google 'Bill Shorten 1998 enterprise bargaining agreement'—</span>

                  </a>  'AWU'—it cost 5,000 workers more than $400 million in lost wages over a decade. I should sit down now. I've put forward two solutions. Both of them I imagine would be unacceptable to the Australian Labor Party. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the burn on this is that the Australian Labor Party of my father's generation and of my youth was interested in workers. They were the ones who were interested in workers. They were the workers' party. I have said here before—and it's worth repeating—that my dear old dad was a devotee of the Labor Party. I have said before that he would punch his hand through his coffin lid tomorrow and mark their box, irrespective of who the candidate was. That was his and my mother's lifetime pattern of voting. But they were supporting a different Labor Party. They would not have supported a Labor Party who entered into enterprise bargaining agreements that cost 5,000 workers $400 million in lost wages over a decade. Of course, this conduct by Mr Shorten was repeated with employees of Target and Just Jeans. If you do the maths, the loss to workers through their terms and conditions, particularly around penalty rates, is probably by now in the order of $1 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go back just to make a point on that. In 1999 the public holiday award rate for a level 1 cleaner was $36.38. That was reduced under that enterprise bargaining agreement to $16.28. They lost a clear $20 an hour. I don't want to reflect on cleaners—I myself have done a bit of that over time—but, if you want to identify a blue-collar worker who is working in not the most appealing job and who is probably lower on the socioeconomic strata than most other blue-collar workers, it would be the cleaners. How do you go to bed as a Labor man after you've reduced their public holiday award rate by $20.10? How does that work? How do you say to the workers, who have looked to that party for decades, 'Stick with us. We're the party of the people. We're the party of the workers, particularly blue collar workers and the like. Stick with us and we'll improve your terms and conditions of employment,' only to reduce them?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's recap on my two failed ideas. The first was thinking I'd have bipartisan support. The other was to establish a Fair Work Commission, and I must confess my ignorance to that until my staff alerted me to it. There is a Fair Work Commission that was put in place by the Australian Labor Party to be arm's length and to govern such matters. Now we hear in this place constantly their criticism of the independent commission, which they formed, because they're not happy with what's happening there. Now their alternative is, for the Australian people and Australian workers, to give Mr Shorten the top job. He'll fix this for you. He will see, in the blink of an eye, reductions in your wages, and it won't affect his sleeping patterns because he's got a long chronic history of doing just that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Things have improved for workers in this country under this coalition government. I attach myself to some of the remarks of Senator Sterle. He was right about the incidents that we've talked about, and there's no question in my mind that there are issues around our 457 visa system that need to be tidied up, particularly in circumstances that he related. And there is exploitation of some workers under this system in agricultural industries, where the brokers who present them as a workforce treat some of them very poorly and, in fact, unlawfully. So I attach myself; I don't walk away from those remarks. I've been very vocal on it up to this point in time. I've made representations to the relevant ministers and I'm satisfied that the efforts that they have underway will eventually mitigate those circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I've got to tell you: to have the Australian Labor Party come and start to lecture us on terms and conditions for workers in this country, when this government has provided so many more people with a job under Abbott and Turnbull—and I'm sure that will continue under Morrison, to fix an economy that was failing as a result of the legacies of the Australian Labor Party—I find it a bit rich. But I know why it's happening. I said in an earlier contribution today those opposite have got nothing else worthwhile to talk about; otherwise they wouldn't come in here with these subject matters and give us the opportunity to belt them around the ears. They've been done over twice today. It's because they've got no substantive issue that they find the government vulnerable on that we'd find difficult to defend. They've got nothing else to say, and the Australian people who are watching this—I hope they're all having a snooze and not spending their time watching the Senate—need to take note just as we have here today.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator URQUHART</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:23</span>):  I also rise to make a contribution to this debate on this matter of public importance. I specifically want to talk about the need for governments as employers at all levels to stand up for workers and actually bargain in good faith, actually care about their workforce, about their wages, about their working conditions, their health and safety, and about them as people, as critical members of our communities delivering vital public services. For five long years here in Canberra and in my home state of Tasmania, we have endured Liberal governments that actively seek to undermine and undervalue the vital work of our public servants. Their key tactic is very low wage offers that would see workers' pay not keep up with inflation. And they use the threat of job losses if workers don't agree to their cruel requests. This appalling behaviour leaves many public servants in a bind: take a small wage increase, or take industrial action. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm extremely proud of the thousands of public servants across Tasmania who joined their union and together pushed for fairness. Of course, under the current system, the odds are stacked against workers, and a desperate Liberal government will do whatever it takes. They launch highly personal attacks on our public servants. Show me a nurse who doesn't want to care for a patient, a teacher who doesn't want to inspire a student or a public servant who doesn't want to make sure that our government functions. It's so easy for a minister to issue a threatening statement, to misrepresent the situation and to attack the workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen a lot of it lately in Tasmania—desperate ministers are playing the worker rather than trying to negotiate in good faith or even to bargain at all. The Tasmanian Liberal government copied the federal Liberal approach to public sector wages, setting an indefinite wage cap below inflation and refusing to negotiate. After years of wages going backwards and as negotiations stalled, Tasmanian public servants reluctantly launched some industrial action. When the Liberal government refused to negotiate, the public servants, rightly, increased their industrial action. So far, all we've seen are personal attacks and misrepresentation of the industrial action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this week, the Tasmanian Liberal police minister, Mr Michael Ferguson, launched a bizarre and untrue attack on workers in Forensic Science Services Tasmania, inaccurately claiming that their measured and sensible industrial action would make Tasmania less safe and allow crooks to get off scot-free, with up to 15 criminals unable to be pursued by police each week. He then said that victims of crime would suffer the most from the union's tactics. Of course, the facts couldn't be further from this. The public servants then cleared up the matter: their industrial action would simply create a backlog which could at any time be resolved with additional resources allocated by the government. What a pathetic beat-up by a desperate government, out of touch with Tasmanians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it doesn't end there. The Tasmanian police minister is also the Tasmanian health minister. He has overseen a health crisis that has plagued our state for years and he's refusing to bargain in good faith with our state's overworked and underpaid nurses and midwives, who have also been forced to take industrial action. This is action which, of course, limits activity in our state's hospitals and action which the minister should recognise is entirely within the rights of the nurses and midwives, and which he should seek to end by presenting a fair pay offer to Tasmanian public servants—not a pay offer which is hundreds of dollars a year below the inflation rate, not an offer which undermines Tasmania's ability to attract new nurses and not an offer that would make our nurses the lowest paid in the country when our cost of living continues to rise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This pattern is repeated across the state, with teachers, nurses, firefighters, cleaners, paramedics and others taking reasonable action in pursuit of a decent pay rise. I commend Tasmanian union members for their unity, their courage and their camaraderie across the movement. I say firmly to the Tasmanian government: end this impasse, recognise that your offer is too low, come to the table with a fair deal and negotiate—and I mean negotiate fairly and equitably with those who the workers have chosen to represent them. Tasmanians who are public servants deserve a pay rise and they deserve a decent pay rise.</span>

I will conclude this debate by making a number of points. I will talk about certain histories that go back certain years and, if I have time, I will certainly talk about the tax aspect.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of points that I will make really go to what Senator Abetz would have called an 'inconvenient fact'. In 1998, and when head of the Australian Workers Union, the AWU, Mr Bill Shorten signed an enterprise agreement with Cleanevent. We all know this. This saw around 5,000 workers lose as much as $400 million in wages according to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> newspaper. This deal saw Cleanevent employees signed up to the AWU membership unless they explicitly opted out. It turns out that up to 90 per cent of Cleanevent employees were added to the AWU membership rolls without necessarily knowing that this had occurred. This was, by any stretch of the imagination, a dirty deal between Cleanevent's management and Mr Bill Shorten's AWU, made at the expense of ordinary workers. It was done to reduce the wages for Cleanevent, who were paying cleaners well below what they were earning in rival companies, while Mr Shorten's AWU benefited from additional members, many of whom were signed up without their knowledge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it wasn't only in 1998 that we saw this happen; it wasn't only under Mr Bill Shorten's AWU that such dirty tricks occurred. In 2010, after Mr Paul Howes took over from Mr Bill Shorten as head of the union, the AWU:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In return, Cleanevent would pay the AWU $25,000 a year as membership fees for casual cleaners.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Cleanevent senior executive who gave final sign-off on the agreement, Julianne Page, at first told the commission she could not explain why an email from the company's head of HR said the union would not agree to having a trade-off for lower wages listed in the same document as a payment for membership.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="AI6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  I attended all of the hearings of this committee. The committee came about as a result of a Senate estimates hearing where I was questioning the Fair Work Ombudsman about its report on Tasmanian cleaners, where it was clear that there was systematic exploitation of cleaners employed by Woolworths in Tasmania. During that questioning, Senator Molan interjected to defend Woolworths' position. I thought that was appalling—when I was defending some of the lowest-paid workers, workers that had been exploited—that a coalition senator would intervene and try and defend Woolworths for their part in this exploitation. I then determined that I would try and get to the bottom of what happened. That resulted in the Senate approving the references committee to inquire into the exploitation of cleaners in the retail sector. We've named the report <span style="font-style:italic;">Wage theft—what wage theft?</span> What we basically had was employers coming along and arguing that they had no responsibility for the wage theft being put on low-paid workers, because they had contracted their responsibilities out to a contractor and it was the responsibility of that contractor. Yet companies like Woolworths actually set the terms and conditions of the contract that can be entered into, then these contractors further subcontract across a number of subcontractors. It's what's described as pyramid subcontracting, where workers get less and less wages as it goes down that pyramid, to the extent that workers have their wages stolen and the companies don't meet their legal obligations. We see a position where workers are living in abject poverty. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've come up with is not only recommendations in relation to that, but during the course of the hearing it became clear that the contractor that Woolworths were using, their principal contractor, was the same contractor that the Department of Finance had used to contract out the work of the cleaners in Parliament House. You remember the issue there. The department contracted the cleaners' work out and the cleaners ended up with a six per cent wage cut because of the position. This is exactly what's happening with companies around the country and with the departments under the guidance of this government: contract the work out, then deny any responsibility for those workers' wages and conditions because the contract has been signed and the company or the department don't employ these workers. It's all care and no responsibility. It's an outrageous proposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this reminds you of is exactly the same position that workers found themselves in at 7-Eleven and Shell. Remember all the exploitation that took place there? Mainly migrant workers, workers who had no great command of English, were subject to exploitation because Woolworths took the position that they would contract out to a company called Broadspectrum and then Broadspectrum contracted out to other companies such as a company named Pioneer, who had been found to have breached workplace laws over a period of time. This is how this government is allowing departments, under the auspices of the government, to treat workers. It is absolutely unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've come up with 22 recommendations. I'll just go briefly to some of them. We've said, firstly, that the Migrant Workers Taskforce should immediately release the report, along with the progress report, within a month so that the work of the Migrant Workers Taskforce can be set beside the work that this committee has done to deal with the issues. We've said that the government should take into account the evidence and recommendations of this reference committee report in relation to wage theft and the exploitation of workers. We have recommended that the Fair Work Ombudsman stop negotiating compliance deeds that only go back a certain period of time, when the workers are being ripped off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we saw in this report was that the workers in Tasmania had been ripped off since 2010. Yet the Fair Work Ombudsman had only gone back a set period of time for those workers to recover their wages. It's an outrageous position that is being adopted by the Fair Work Ombudsman. The Fair Work Ombudsman should be ashamed for putting that position forward. They are allowing companies to rip workers off, with impunity. What are the sanctions if you're caught breaching the award? Even by the Fair Work Ombudsman's standards, they are very little. You can be sure that the Fair Work Ombudsman will only go back a certain period to recover the wages of those workers and will not go back the full period of time that the workers were ripped off. It was an outrageous position that the Fair Work Ombudsman took, only matched by the outrageous position of Woolworths.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Woolworths are now the only big retail company in the country that don't employ cleaners directly. And they couldn't give us an answer as to why they would not employ directly so that workers get decent wages and conditions and are employed directly by the company—other than that there was some specialised work to be done. You can make your own mind up about how 'specialised' it is to actually keep a place clean and work to proper instructions in Woolworths. Every other company in Australia can do it, but Woolworths claim they can't. They still try and push their responsibilities for workers out, back to contractors, and claim there is no problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They actually set up some recovery process for these workers and they advertised in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>. What cleaner is going to read the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>? And they put out notices that were so complex it was difficult for the committee to comprehend what they meant in these notices. This is an absolute disgrace. Woolworths is one of the biggest companies in this country, yet their workers are being ripped off. Even as late as today, we got correspondence from an accountant in Western Australia, who has indicated that they have gone through some of the cases of exploitation in other states and that Woolworths are not calculating the wages of these workers properly. They're leaving it up to the contractors to calculate the wage theft, and they are not taking a strong position to deal with this issue. It is absolutely ridiculous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate the company Adam Hunter Pty Ltd in Western Australia, who are looking after workers—doing what the Fair Work Ombudsman should have been doing but not doing properly. Adam Hunter Pty Ltd have outlined that, even after this report, even after we've seen this—and when Woolworths and the contractors are saying that the only problem is in Tasmania—this is a problem nationwide for Woolworths. Woolworths should get off their backside, look after workers, employ them directly and stop allowing wage theft under their watch. It is a ridiculous proposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just go back to where I started: for any coalition senator to intervene on behalf of a company like Woolworths when I'm questioning them about stealing the wages of workers is an outrage, and Senator Molan should be absolutely ashamed of himself. It is outrageous, what he did. The only good thing about it is that it allowed this report, and I will speak to this report more in an ongoing position. I'm not sure whether I need to seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:45</span>):  I just want to take a few minutes today to talk about the same issue as Senator Cameron did. And Senator Cameron, I would like to thank you for leading this inquiry. He's just outlined the conclusions and the recommendations of the report more generally. I also want to focus on some of the issues outlined in chapter 3. Chapter 3 really relates to the Fair Work Ombudsman. The fact that this issue happened in Tasmania, my home state, is of quite some concern to me. A Fair Work Ombudsman investigation was commenced in November 2014 into the compliance of cleaning contractors engaged by supermarkets in Tasmania. The Ombudsman's report released in February 2018 found noncompliance with legal obligations by cleaning contractors at 90 per cent of Woolworths sites in Tasmania. The Fair Work Ombudsman's report highlighted that the majority of cleaners who were interviewed by inspectors during the site visits in Tasmania were unable to provide details of the nature of their engagement, were unwilling to advise how much they were being paid, hadn't received payslips, were paid a flat rate for all ours hours worked, were unaware of the applicable penalty rates under the award and were unable to provide a clear indication of the business that employed them, except for a first name and sometimes a mobile number of the person they reported to—and that's because, as Senator Cameron spoke about, there's a 'chain of uncommand', if you like, whereby Woolworths basically subcontracts the work out and it keeps going on down the line until nobody wants to take responsibility—and a majority of them were from overseas or of a non-English-speaking background.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fair Work Ombudsman uncovered underpayments of around $64,000 as well as multiple breaches relating to rostering, payslips and record keeping. They estimate that the underpayment was greater than $64,000, but they were unable to fully quantify the workers' entitlements because of poor record keeping, false and inaccurate records and a lack of cooperation from the workers, possibly owing to the fact that they were worried that if they cooperated they would probably lose their job. So, while it was the contractors who were primarily responsible for these breaches, the Fair Work Ombudsman also observed that Woolworths contributed through the cost and time pressures they placed on contractors. That inquiry also found that Woolworths had contributed to the culture of noncompliance through deficiencies in procurement and oversight of its cleaning contractors. They failed to ensure that cleaners complied with their visitors-book protocol and often signed in and out with a different contractor's name. They also failed to issue identification cards. So, who knows who would have been in there doing what in the supermarkets. Some cleaners advised Fair Work Ombudsman inspectors that they'd not completed any sort of induction. This led to difficulties identifying which cleaners were on which sites, which obviously contributed to the difficulty in quantifying their workers entitlements, and exposed workers to unacceptable health and safety risks as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 24 August 2018 Woolworths entered into a proactive compliance deed with the Fair Work Ombudsman. A proactive compliance deed is a mechanism used by the FWO to formalise compliance partnerships with businesses to ensure that their systems and processes are working effectively to build a culture of compliance. Through the inquiry we heard from the law firm Maurice Blackburn and the cleaners union United Voice that there were significant limitations in the compliance deed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the deed only required Woolworths to ensure that employees receive their full entitlements from 1 July 2014, so, if you hadn't been paid properly previous to that, too bad. The time limit was pretty arbitrary, and we did note that a similar deed for 7-Eleven was not time limited. The committee noted that the language in advertising material promoting Woolworths's Speak Up service—that's where workers can report suspected misconduct—was complex, particularly for workers from non-English-speaking backgrounds. The deed also put the onus on workers to come forward and claim entitlements instead of Woolworths proactively determining repayments. The deed also had inadequate processes to ensure responsible contracting, going forward, such as safeguards to minimise the risk of noncompliance and maintaining safe productivity levels to avoid risk of occupational injury. United Voice and Maurice Blackburn referred to the deed as 'a missed opportunity to reset the relationship between Woolworths and the cleaning workforce and initiate new arrangements to ensure that the cleaners that work in these stores are employed on fair and lawful terms in the future'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pretty disturbed about this exploitation happening in Woolworths stores. Tasmanians pride themselves on being a fair and decent type of people, and for it to happen in my beautiful home state of Tasmania was quite disturbing. In the absence of any nationwide investigation, I do wonder whether there are not similar scenarios playing out across the country. As far as I'm aware, no management staff in Woolworths have been disciplined over the shortcomings in their contracting processes. As the report notes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the committee views the actions of Woolworths in managing its cleaning arrangements for its Tasmanian stores as a highly indicative case study highlighting the 'all power, no responsibility' mindset that plagues some businesses under the current legislative framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee, as Senator Cameron said, made a number of recommendations to improve future compliance deeds negotiated by the Fair Work Ombudsman, and I hope the ombudsman gives these serious consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The poor treatment of cleaners by Woolworths contractors in my home state of Tasmania is symptomatic of the high rates of exploitation in this industry, and we must do more to ensure that vulnerable workers, such as those in the cleaning industry, are protected from exploitation and that they receive their full pay and entitlements. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

As I mentioned, I'm pleased to speak to the committee's advisory report on the Office of National Intelligence Bill 2018 and the Office of National Intelligence (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018, as presented to the Senate by Senator Williams.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills form a component of the government's response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">2017 Independent intelligence review</span>. The review's major recommendation was that the Office of National Intelligence, the ONI, be established in the Prime Minister's portfolio. The review has noted that ONI would be headed by a director-general who would be the Prime Minister's principal adviser on matters relating to the national intelligence community. The director-general would not be empowered to direct the specific activities of agencies but should be able to direct the coordination of the national intelligence community to ensure there are appropriately integrated strategies across the suite of agency capabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills continue the former Office of National Assessments, ONA, as ONI, with a revised mandate to lead the national intelligence community. The ONI Bill further extends ONI's assessment and evaluation functions from that of the ONA. It provides ONI with a specific open-source collection function and positions the director-general as the head of the national intelligence community. The director-general's responsibilities include keeping the Prime Minister informed on matters relating to the national intelligence community. The ONI (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill repeals the Office of National Assessments Act 1977 and amends 18 other acts to reflect the proposed operation of ONI.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During its review of the bills, the committee examined how the proposed legislation reflected the recommendations from the <span style="font-style:italic;">2017 Independent intelligence review</span>. The committee also examined whether ONI was given adequate powers and functions to lead a better coordinated and more integrated intelligence community and examined whether the bills impacted on the existing role and statutory functions of the other Australian intelligence agencies. The committee received three submissions on the bills and held a public hearing on 16 August 2018 in Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee subsequently made six recommendations in relation to the bills. The first recommendation was that the comprehensive review into the legal framework of the national intelligence community, currently underway, examine the consistency of provisions across national intelligence community legislation which enable these agencies to operate with foreign authorities. The second recommendation was that the Director-General of the Office of National Intelligence be unable to delegate his or her powers to authorise ONI to engage with foreign partners. The third recommendation removes a secrecy offence from the bill consistent with the committee's recent advisory report on the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017. The fourth recommendation was that ONI's privacy rules be made public except to the extent that those rules contain classified information. The fifth recommendation was that the Prime Minister consult with the Privacy Commissioner when making privacy rules for ONI. The sixth and final recommendation is that, subject to implementation of these recommendations, the bill be passed. I commend the report to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion seeks to disallow an instrument that the government is attempting to make which would expand the group of people who are subject to the fast-track application process for protection as refugees. The definition of 'fast track applicant' is set out in the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Act 2014. The term currently includes all unauthorised maritime arrivals. That is, of course, the government's language, not that of the Australian Greens. That group of people are those who arrived by boat in Australia without a valid visa—and I make the observation that there is no offence under Australian law and that these people were acting entirely within their rights under international legal covenants that Australia has signed up to—between 13 August 2012 and 1 January 2014 and were not taken to Nauru or Papua New Guinea for offshore processing. I'm using the government's language here when describing it as 'offshore processing', as anyone who has been watching what has been happening on Manus Island and Nauru will be very clear in their minds that what these people are being subjected to on Manus Island and Nauru is in fact indefinite offshore detention. So the group of people that are currently classed as fast-track applicants had to arrive by boat without a valid visa between 13 August 2012 and 1 January 2014 and were not exiled to Manus Island or Nauru, provided that the minister has allowed them to apply for a protection visa and the person has made a valid application.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister can also, by instrument, extend the definition of 'fast-track' to other classes of people seeking asylum—and, in fact, that is exactly what this instrument that we are seeking to disallow today seeks to do. So, not content with the misery, the uncertainty and the injustice to which people who are classified as fast-track applicants have been subjected by this government, the minister now wants to cast his net even further back. The instrument that we're seeking to disallow would, if it were not disallowed, apply the category of 'fast-track applicant' to people seeking asylum who arrived in Australia by boat before 2012, were assessed by the department as not engaging Australia's protection obligations and then challenged the department's assessments in the courts. Now what the government is seeking to do is to deny them the opportunity to fully explore challenges to the department's decision in the legal system. This is a significant denial of natural justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's instrument that we're seeking to disallow today is not only a significant denial of natural justice but also an undermining of the rule of law in this country. It creates different classes of people in Australia—some who have access to certain legal options and others who do not. It continues the demonisation of people seeking asylum by the Liberal and National parties in this place in order to try to extract electoral and political benefit for themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are not prepared to take this lying down. That is why we have moved this disallowance motion that we are currently debating. I can put our case to the Senate very clearly. People who end up in the fast-track process are not given a fair opportunity to put forward their case for asylum and to deal with adverse information affecting their application. The fast-track process limits people's right to appeal adverse findings to the Immigration Assessment Authority—which, as Legal Aid Victoria said last year:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Rather than being focussed on providing fairness to people seeking asylum, and on making correct decisions, the IAA can conduct only limited review according to limiting rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is creating situations where people seeking asylum are blindsided by issues and evidence which they had no idea they needed to deal with. And these are profoundly disadvantaged people, in desperate need, colliding with an extremely complex area of law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a neat summary of what the government is trying to do here: to make decisions that adversely affect some of the most disadvantaged people in our country, who are in desperate need and have been enmeshed in an extremely complex area of administrative law. Ultimately, in the view of the Australian Greens, the fast-track process has been set up by a government and ministers who simply don't want people to have a fair chance to apply for asylum in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen the human costs of this government's policy around people seeking asylum. We know that thousands of innocent people who are guilty of nothing other than fleeing persecution and seeking a better life for themselves, the overwhelming majority of whom have been found to be genuine refugees, have been exiled to Manus Island and Nauru for over five years now. Over five years of their lives have been lost because of this cruel, horrendous policy that has created a humanitarian calamity in our offshore detention system. We've seen murders, assaults, sexual assaults, sexual assaults of children, riots, abuses and the trampling of human rights. This is a humanitarian calamity that is occurring in our offshore detention system. Those who were not exiled to Manus Island or Nauru have progressively had their rights eroded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens don't support any element of the fast-track process, because we think people in this country should have equal access to the law. You wouldn't think that's a controversial position, but it is for the Liberal and National parties in this place, who want to create two classes of people in this country and two different opportunities to access justice through our administrative and legal system. At every step the Liberals have reduced rights of appeal and procedural fairness and have increased the power of the minister for immigration. They're doing this because the courts are doing a far better job of ensuring human rights are respected in this country than this government ever has. It's an ongoing demonisation of innocent and vulnerable people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeking to draw a line in the sand tonight and say: 'Enough is enough. You cannot simply go on making more and more punitive laws to deny more and more people access to justice and the rule of law.' The government doesn't like what the courts are doing here. It's worth pointing out that the overwhelming majority of the children who in the last couple of months have been brought from Nauru haven't been brought out of the goodness of the heart of the government, the minister or the Prime Minister; they've been brought here because the courts ordered it. The courts made those decisions and the government had no option other than to comply with those orders and rulings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are still $20,000 bribes on the table to try to convince people who were on Manus Island and Nauru to return to face the persecution from which they fled. The Liberals are currently trying to deport people back to North Korea, would you believe it? They've continually sent people fleeing war and persecution straight back to their home countries. In some cases they've handed these people straight into the arms of their persecutors, the people whom they fled, and this government sends them back to goodness knows what fate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Liberals want the power to deport children so they can continue to run the racist scare campaign that they're currently running in Victoria. It is worth pointing out that the instrument that we are seeking to disallow here confirms that children of people the government has classified as fast-track applicants will also be deemed fast-track applicants. This instrument that we are seeking to disallow denies children access to natural justice in this country. What the government is trying to do here is an absolute disgrace. It is trying to create a legal framework which supports its own prejudices and its hateful world view.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are proud to stand against the government this evening. We led the fight in parliament against the Liberals' attempts to reintroduce the White Australia policy by stealth. It was a battle that we won. For the first time in many years the government lost control of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> in this place, and the then minister for immigration's hateful changes to the citizenship act were struck from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> in this place. We stood up and helped lead the charge against the government when it tried to water down protections against race based hate speech in this country by eviscerating section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. We defeated its attempts to restrict family reunion visas to the very wealthy. We will keep on fighting this government until it is thrown out of office and these dreadful laws are struck from the statute book in this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If senators want to think about why they should support this disallowance motion this evening—it may come to a vote this evening or it may come to a vote tomorrow evening—I invite them to think about their values. If senators have got values about treating people equally, if senators have got values that support the rule of law as one of the absolute foundations of our civilisation and our society and if senators have got values around respecting people's human rights and treating people as they would wish to be treated themselves, then I invite them in the strongest possible terms to support this disallowance motion.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a parliament cannot continue to remove rights from desperate people, from vulnerable people, just because some people in this place think it will deliver them an electoral benefit. We cannot continue to remove fairness from our administrative and judicial systems. We cannot continue to create situations where vulnerable, desperate people are blindsided in the Immigration Assessment Authority by issues and evidence that they had no idea they needed to deal with. We cannot continue to profoundly disadvantage people who, in their hour of desperate need and vulnerability, collide with this extremely complex area of law. People in the fast-track process are not given a fair opportunity to put forward their case for asylum, and they're not given a fair opportunity to deal with the adverse information affecting their application.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens, in putting forward this disallowance motion today, are standing up for some of the most vulnerable, desperate and disenfranchised people who are currently in our country. If you don't look after the vulnerable, if you don't look after the disenfranchised, if you don't look after the desperate, that actually says more about you than it does about them. We want to give this Senate, when this comes to a vote this evening or tomorrow evening, the opportunity to show that the values that so many people claim as Australian—the values of a fair go, of mateship and of reaching out a helping hand to people who are in desperate need of help—are genuinely Australian values and values that are reflected in the parliament, which is here to represent the values of the Australian people and to make sure those values are reflected in our laws and our legislative instruments. That's why we bring on this disallowance tonight: so that every senator has an opportunity to do the right thing and every senator is given every opportunity to make sure that those values are real, true and reflected not just through Australian society but right into this building, into this chamber and into the heart of our democratic system. If we don't reflect those values in here, what does it say about us? I'll tell you what it says about us if we don't reflect those values; it says we're hypocrites and we're not doing our job to represent our nation's values.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a time, decades ago, when Australia was a shining light around the world for our global leadership on human rights. We have seen that consistently eroded. We saw that eroded in 2001 when the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa</span> hovered over the horizon and, since then, it has been a race to the bottom in this place to try and deny as many desperate, vulnerable people as possible the legal rights that the rest of us enjoy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not going to have a bar of it. We're standing here today and we are drawing a line in the sand. We are saying: 'Enough is enough. Stop demonising some of the most vulnerable people in our community. Stop trying to exploit desperate, vulnerable people for political gain. Stop trying to deny them the appeal opportunities and the review opportunities that the rest of us are lucky enough to have. Stop trying to undermine the rule of law in this country—one of the absolute foundations of our society. Stop trying to work around the courts because you simply don't like the decisions that they're making.' We're not going to stand up to reduce rights of appeal. We're not going to allow this reduction of procedural fairness to occur without fighting it all the way. We're going to stand up and we're going to give this Senate the opportunity to show that we can be better than what the government would like us to be.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are here to hold this government to account; that is a core part of our job in this place. This vote will be an opportunity for senators to show whether they are prepared to stand up and hold this government to account or whether we are collectively going to roll over and allow this government, in its ongoing demonisation of desperate and vulnerable people who are seeking asylum in this country, to increase the group of people who will have their rights trampled by reducing their opportunities to challenge decisions made by the department with regard to their claims for asylum. I genuinely hope senators will join with the Australian Greens to disallow this instrument.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  I just wish to indicate to the chamber Labor will be supporting this motion. On 5 December 2014, the parliament passed legislation to create what has now been labelled the fast-track assessment process for the protection of visa applications, and this legislation came into effect on 19 April 2015. The fast-track assessment process only applies to the legacy caseload, specifically people who arrived in Australia on or after 13 August 2012 and before 1 January 2014 who have not previously been in a regional processing country. The fast-track assessment process uses a review body which was established by the then Abbott government called the Immigration Assessment Authority—otherwise known as the IAA. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review body effectively limits the extent to which a claim for protection can be reviewed, especially compared to the previous review mechanism under the Refugee Review Tribunal. We should be clear about this: the successive Liberal governments have failed to treat asylum seekers and refugees living in a shared Australian community with the respect that they deserve. Asylum seekers and refugees are some of the most vulnerable people living in Australia. They have fled persecution, and that's the definition by which they are determined to be refugees. They have faced trauma and torment. With this instrument, this conservative government is trying to force more people who are part of the so-called legacy caseload into the fast-track process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has provided information that the instrument before the Senate effectively affects approximately 108 individuals. It strikes me that this demonstrates that the government is completely out of touch. By forcing more people into the process which limits their rights to have their claims for protection reviewed, the government actually is undermining some pretty fundamental principles of human rights here. This instrument has done nothing with Australia's border security; these are individuals who are already in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So Labor took a commitment to the last election, as outlined in our national platform, that Labor would abolish the fast-track assessment process. Our national platform also makes it clear the existing fast-track assessment process under the auspices of the Immigration Assessment Authority and the limitation of appeal rights do not provide a fair, thorough and robust assessment process for persons seeking asylum. Labor is committed to ensuring these people found to be owed protection are treated with dignity and respect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People who have been through the fast-track process and who are found to be owed protection have been placed on temporary protection visas by the current government. A temporary protection visa places refugees in an ongoing state of uncertainty and of limbo as they have their claims reassessed every three years. This prevents meaningful settlement and creates hardships for refugees. It actually denies Australia the benefit of their contribution to our society and to their communities. So Labor has announced that in government we will abolish the temporary protection visas and will place those on TPVs and found to be genuine refugees onto a permanent protection visa so they can be afforded the protection and certainty that they are entitled to in this country. Labor also took to the last election this policy to reinstate access to the Refugee Review Tribunal and abolish the IAA established by the Abbott government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the instrument was signed by Minister Dutton on 23 May 2018. This was when Minister Dutton was Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Immigration and Border Protection but before he made that abortive attempt to actually engage in a coup against Prime Minister Turnbull. Let's not forget of course that there was considerable as to whether or not Mr Dutton was even qualified to sit in the parliament, and there still remains considerable doubt even today. That casts legal doubt over the decisions he made as a minister, from cancelling the visas for those actually involved in serious crimes to the signing of such instruments. And so it is apparent that the member's position ought to have been resolved by due process through the legal processes established by the High Court. So I make it clear: Labor will be supporting this disallowance motion.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:24</span>):  I will be brief. I want to firstly acknowledge and thank the Australian Labor Party for their support for this disallowance. I believe that that means that in fact this disallowance will be successful this evening. I want to put very clearly on the record that, in voting for this disallowance, this Senate is actually doing its job to scrutinise the government. That's one of the primary reasons we get voted into this place: to hold the government to account and make sure that when the government overreaches, which they flagrantly have in trying to put this instrument through the parliament, we exercise our rights as senators to say: 'Stop. Enough is enough. You've gone too far.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has tried to go too far, and the Senate is about to stand up to it and make it very clear to the government that enough is enough. This demonisation, this exploitation of desperate, vulnerable people, has to stop. I hope that in drawing this line in the sand today, which will ensure that life does not get even more difficult for a large number of people who are currently resident in this country, we can see some ongoing improvements in the way that we deal with people who seek asylum in Australia—because one day there will be a reckoning for the way we've treated these people. There will be a reckoning for what's happened on Manus Island. There will be a reckoning for what's happened on Nauru. I'm very confident that there will be a royal commission one day into what's happened on Manus Island and Nauru and the way we've treated people seeking asylum in this country and that when that royal commission is concluded the Australian PM of the day will get up and offer a heartfelt apology for what we've done. Unfortunately, I think it will take the passage of a bit of time before that happens, because the architects of offshore detention—they are in both major parties in this place—will have to leave this parliament before we can come to our collective senses, get the truth out, have the royal commission, make our apologies and hopefully do everything we can to make sure that this shameful period in our country's history never happens again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are better than what we have shown over the last 20 years in regard to people who are seeking asylum in this country. We are better than what we have shown over the last 20 years to some of the world's most desperate and vulnerable people. I genuinely believe that support for the way we deal with people seeking asylum is eroding in our community right now. It's eroding because of the kids on Nauru. It's eroding because people in our community are becoming more and more aware of the humanitarian calamity of offshore detention and the denial of basic rights and natural justice to people who are seeking asylum while domiciled in this country. So I thank the Australian Labor Party, I thank the crossbenchers, who I understand are about to support this disallowance, and I commend it to the Senate. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:36</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018. Prime Minister Morrison is due to visit Darwin at the end of this week, and I certainly urge him to make sure that he has a copy of the city deal in his back pocket, ready to go. In May 2017, the Northern Territory government and the federal government signed an MOU for a city deal for Darwin. That's 18 months ago. The Townsville City Deal was signed after just one month and the Launceston City Deal was signed in seven months. There was not a cent in this year's budget for the Darwin City Deal, and it shows the lack of vision, support and foresight this government has for the future of the Northern Territory and, indeed, for northern Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mantra of developing the north seems to have been abandoned by the Morrison government. The Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund is really nowhere to be seen for the number of organisations and businesses that have put forward their hopes and expectations for assistance in the north. The glossy reports, the big promises, the ideas and the time and energy that stakeholders took in putting forward their projects, knowledge and enthusiasm to see northern Australia reach its full potential seem to have fallen by the wayside.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It takes more than a quick drive in a big blue bus to gain some serious insight and understanding of what needs to be done to stimulate the entirety of our north, let alone the Northern Territory. No-one wants to go cap in hand to the Commonwealth, seeking assistance, but there is no doubt that Commonwealth assistance will be required to restore the Territory's fiscal capacity. There are options that I submit need to be examined seriously around the relativity floor and excluding from Commonwealth Grants Commission processes the funding needed to address Aboriginal disadvantage, to address infrastructure deficits and to support enabling infrastructure to develop the north. The Commonwealth could look at the possibility of increased funding to the National Partnership on Northern Territory Remote Aboriginal Investment and at using that avenue to provide capital for additional services to people living in remote communities in the Northern Territory. That would take a lot of pressure off the Northern Territory government's budget.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth's own projections indicate that this much-needed certainty for the Northern Territory is unlikely to be much of a cost burden. However, it would go a long way to restoring confidence in the Northern Territory, with the people of the Territory feeling the full effect of some of the biggest economic and fiscal challenges that the Territory has ever seen.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="241710" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DEAN SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:39</span>):  It's hard to know where to start. Just 12 months ago I stood in exactly the same seat to introduce a private senator's bill that led to the introduction of same-sex marriage. Over the last few years as a senator for Western Australia, I've committed myself to the resolution of a number of issues that I have considered important not just to the make-up of our country but also to the future direction of Western Australia. I'm particularly proud to be able to stand here today as a member of the coalition government led by Scott Morrison, who was the Treasurer not so long ago, and to almost bring to a close this debate about legislation that will bring reform to the goods and services distribution arrangements in Australia and, in doing so, mark perhaps one of the most significant reforms to federal-state financial relations that the country has seen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I provide a brief overview of the long campaign, the long road that has been GST distribution reform in this country, I thought I might just detail exactly what it is that the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018 seeks to do. This bill will amend the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 and the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 to give effect to key elements of the government's interim response to the Productivity Commission's inquiry report <span style="font-style:italic;">Horizontal fiscal equalisation</span>. The key elements of the government's interim response include: transitioning the horizontal fiscal equalisation system from full equalisation, equalised to the strongest state or territory, to reasonable equalisation, equalised to the stronger of New South Wales and Victoria; introducing a minimum goods and service tax revenue-sharing relativity—or the GST relativity floor, as it's known—that may be determined by the Treasurer for any individual state or territory; and permanently boosting the GST revenue pool with additional Commonwealth financial assistance. The following elements of the government's interim response are given effect under existing laws: providing short-term transition payments to any state or territory with a GST revenue-sharing relativity factor below 0.7; and providing short-term transition payments to the Northern Territory if its revenue-sharing relativity falls below its determined relativity factor for 2017-18. The bill introduces a guarantee that each state and territory will get the better of the current distribution system and the updated distribution system during the transition period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the six years that I have been a senator, I think there have probably only been two moments more significant than this in shaping the framework of Australia's federal system of government. One, I would argue—others might differ—was the reforms to the Senate voting system that were introduced and agreed by the Senate in advance of the 2016 federal election. Of course, for those of us that can remember, it was the opposition that some coalition senators led to the Rudd plan to amend the Commonwealth Constitution to provide recognition for local government. That was a debate that raged inside the coalition under the leadership of Tony Abbott first. It was a debate that we had in this Senate chamber. If I recall correctly, eight coalition senators, including me, opposed that referendum proposition on the basis that it would undermine the federal nature of our system of government, not enhance it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The debate that has been raging in regard to the GST distribution arrangements as they affect Western Australia is not a new one. What demonstrates the shallowness of Labor's understanding of this issue thus far is that they have failed to recognise the contribution of one important person, the person who called out this issue first in 2007. That was none other than Eric Ripper, the Labor Treasurer of the Western Australian state government at the time. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> in the Western Australian parliamentary record makes it very clear that he drew the attention of Western Australians to this issue first. Then, over the next 10 to 11 years, the level of understanding and the level of anxiety started to grow in our home state of Western Australia because it dawned on Western Australians, at a time of tremendous growth in our state, that the GST system wasn't allowing Western Australia to be the best and strongest it could be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coalition senators, aided and supported by people like Colin Barnett and—I'll be the first to admit; I'm happy to say this—the chorus of Western Australians that built over the last number of years from Kununurra to Esperance in the north and the south out across to Perth and Kalbarri and all the suburbs in between, led this and deserve to have the fullest recognition given them for standing firm, standing strong and making sure that their voices were heard very loudly both in this Senate chamber and in the government at the time. John Howard himself has made it crystal clear that, while people absolutely expected there to be fluctuations in the GST distribution arrangements and the relativities that were borne out of that over time, no-one foresaw the magnitude of the variances that the GST distribution system would deliver and no-one could foresee the magnitude of the GST relativity as it would affect Western Australia during a time of tremendous economic activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth reminding people of those relativities, which were most recently announced by the Commonwealth Grants Commission and approved by the government, and reflecting on them. It takes tremendous courage for senators from the Northern Territory and Tasmania to come into this Senate chamber and argue GST distribution issues, because the system quite rightly provides the most generous arrangements for them. What did the GST relativities in the most recent announcements mean for our country? For New South Wales the relativity fell from 88c to 86c in the dollar, but that still meant that New South Wales would get $18 billion, or 27.4 per cent of the GST pool. For Victoria the GST relativity meant that it would rise from 93c to 99c, meaning Victoria would get $16.8 billion, or 25.6 per cent of the GST pool. The Northern Territory is taking home $4.26, Tasmania $1.77, South Australia $1.48, the ACT $1.18, Queensland $1.10 and my home state of Western Australia went from 34c cents to 47c, meaning a GST revenue of $3.3 billion, or 4.9 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's worth reminding ourselves of, because what makes this particular initiative so profound is that, when this debate started, much of the hand-wringing revolved around that almost intractable issue: how do you correct a very obvious anomaly in the GST distribution arrangements which left Western Australia with just 30c in the dollar without unnecessarily penalising other states and territories? It's a great testament to the creative thinking of Treasury officials and of this government that they were able to craft a solution that not only benefits Western Australia to the tune of $4.7 billion but also leaves no state worse off and has left many states in a slightly better position. When this debate started, that was an impossible dream, but since then over time we've seen some hard-headedness and persistence on the part of Western Australians and a willingness on the part of Scott Morrison as Treasurer and as Prime Minister to make sure this deal could work in the national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the contribution of the Productivity Commission. I was someone that argued very early that the Productivity Commission should be trusted as the independent umpire over this issue. The Productivity Commission process was very transparent. It had demonstrated a great capacity to handle and come to conclusions on important macroeconomic and microeconomic issues across Australia. That Productivity Commission process of taking submissions, preparing a draft report, making that draft report available to the community and again using the contributions and submissions of others in coming to a final proposition made the Productivity Commission absolutely well suited to the task of trying to find a way through what many thought was intractable and many thought was an impasse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to acknowledge that this is not a campaign or an argument that only Western Australians have made. In fact, I argue that at critical points the great bulk of the country, led by the governments of Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales, was arguing for reform. You only have to look at the history and the submission processes and the various reviews that were undertaken prior to the Productivity Commission's inquiry to see that many states, under various political leaderships, had been arguing that the GST system, as it was then constructed, was not working for them. There were words like 'opaque', 'seriously flawed', 'inequitable' and 'perverse outcomes'. This was the language that other state governments were using to describe the GST distribution arrangements. So, rather than this being an issue of concern just to Western Australia, I argue that over the last few years other states also recognised that the GST distribution arrangements that had previously worked were not suitable for the future and were not fit for purpose in making sure that the Australian economy was as robust as it possibly could be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the contributions from Labor senators particularly—particularly those from Western Australia—in the course of this debate, we've heard a lot of commentary, a lot of partisan commentary, about the performance of the Barnett government and the financial management of Premier Barnett and his team at the time. It's important to understand the broader context in which Colin Barnett and the Liberal government were governing in Western Australia. It's only when you understand the broader context that you can properly understand the very real challenges that were facing Western Australia. Again, I highlight this particular point: Western Australia went to 30c in the dollar. Over the first 10 years of the distribution system, no state fell below 86c. In the last five years, no state has fallen below 88c. But, in the last five years, Western Australia has dipped to as low as 30c in the dollar. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is particularly concerning about that is not just that Western Australia went to 30c but that the Commonwealth Grants Commission itself said it was 'totally conceivable'—its words—that a relativity could fall to zero, and, in the Commonwealth Grants Commission's own words, the fairness of that would depend on where you sat. So here we have the Commonwealth Grants Commission performing its function very well, theoretically, but being blind to the real consequences that state governments would have to face as a result of serious dips or serious changes in their GST relativity—and heaven forbid that any state should ever have got to zero. The fact that the Commonwealth Grants Commission was unrelenting in that view that applied only a theoretical lens to the issue of distribution was, to me, significant cause for concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Claims by Labor, particularly Labor senators from my home state of Western Australia, that WA's budget was mismanaged by the former Liberal-National government fail to recognise the effect that the failed GST formula has had on Western Australian finances. During the period of the Barnett government, the population of the state of Western Australia grew by over 400,000 people. Putting that into a context that Tasmanian Senators Brown, Polley, Urquhart and Whish-Wilson will understand, that is nearly 80 per cent of the population of Tasmania. This led to a significant increase in demand on services provided by the state government and a need for major infrastructure improvements to ensure that services met community expectations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Between 2008-09 and 2015-16 the government invested over $51 billion in its Asset Investment Program, with the 2016-17 budget set to spend another $5.9 billion. You only need to look to the outer suburbs of Perth—I note that the Deputy President, Senator Lines, from Western Australia, is here—to see the expenditure on new schools and transport infrastructure; visit a regional town like Karratha, like I do, to see the transformation of health and education facilities; or drive past the new Perth Children's Hospital, the Fiona Stanley Hospital, the Midland hospital or the Joondalup Health Campus to see where that infrastructure money was spent by the Barnett government. I challenge Labor to point out which one of these major pieces of infrastructure shouldn't have been built, or doesn't need or deserve to be the focus of Western Australia's infrastructure build. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to recurrent expenditure, it's not too hard to see why the government ran a deficit of nearly $2 billion in 2016-17. In 2016-17, WA received less than $2 billion in GST, a share of just over 30c in the dollar, as I have already highlighted. In that same year, around $4.7 billion of GST revenue was being redistributed to other states. State governments, as senators would be aware, provide the majority of funding for health, education, and law and order. The government chose not to make massive cuts to these services, which would have been up to nearly 10 per cent across the board. It decided instead to run a deficit. This is not financial mismanagement but an understanding that the services could not sustain the cuts without significant reductions in the services that could be delivered. This GST solution ensures that the state will never face the same circumstances again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the very brief time that's available to me, I do want to acknowledge the contribution of a few people who aren't in this Senate chamber any more. The only person to bring forward a private senator's bill to reform the GST was Senator Dio Wang from Western Australia, who is no longer here. I acknowledge Senator Dio Wang's contribution. The other is Senator Joe Bullock, Labor senator for Western Australia, who, early on, went on the public record arguing for reform of the GST distribution arrangements. In all fairness, I think it is important to acknowledge his contribution as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I like to say, this chapter is not the end of a debate about federal-state financial reform in our country but the beginning of that debate. What we have seen in this debate is a desire on the part of states and territories to have much greater independence and autonomy in how they raise money and spend money. As a very, very strong federalist I think that is a debate we need to have and continue to have in this country. The debate about the GST is not just about distribution, though that is the element of the debate that has occupied much of our time; it is also about the base and it is about the rate. I stand resolute that, by broadening the base of the GST, you can keep the rate low. As a senator who wants to see low taxes in our country I don't argue for an increase in the GST rate, but I do argue for a broadening of its base. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a demonstration again of what the Australian Senate can do on behalf of the states and territories that senators represent. This should be a very, very powerful message to every senator that standing up for the interests of your state, your constituency, will not get you punished by your electorate but actually get you rewarded by your electorate. Western Australians want to make sure that their senators are vocal, and have a strong voice, in the Senate. This legislation is a demonstration that that can be done. This legislation deserves the fullest possible support, from every senator in this place. </span>

                    <a href="F49" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:59</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Every State and Territory Gets Their Fair Share of GST) Bill 2018 as a Labor senator for the state of Tasmania. As Tasmanians, we know the issues around the GST just as well as Western Australian senators do. I'm proud to speak in support of this legislation on behalf of my party and my state, because, after much advocacy from my fellow Labor colleagues—the member for Franklin, Julie Collins; the member for Bass, Ross Hart; the member for Braddon, Justine Keay; the member for Lyons, Brian Mitchell; and the Labor Senate team from Tasmania—the government has finally seen fit to meet, at least in part, our demands. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're unfortunately all too familiar with how the current Prime Minister views my home state, what we weren't able to see until very recently was a guarantee that Tasmania's share of the GST would not be going backwards, at least in the short term. As Treasurer, the current Prime Minister opposed Labor's insistence that we have a legislative floor for the state's share of the GST. I have to say, as well, that we also acknowledge the issue that has been raised by our Labor Western Australian colleagues and of course the Western Australian senators opposite. The Prime Minister previously described the legislative floor as unnecessary. Since then, he's backflipped—following Labor's lead and the needs of Tasmania—for now. It took two weeks of tireless advocacy from the Tasmanian Labor representatives to drag the government to the point where they caved in on the GST, and the government keeps sending mixed messages about the future of the scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a fact that Tasmania relies on the GST a great deal. Commonwealth funds total over 60 per cent of our $6 billion state budget, and that's certainly above the national average. Labor invested heavily in schools and hospitals during its time in government, working to bring my home state up towards the national average. Since then, Liberal governments have unfortunately starved the state of funding. Our hospitals are again at breaking point and our schools are crying out for investment, and our public servants are underpaid and the government is arguing it can't afford to provide them with the pay rise they've been calling for. That's why this victory is a welcome one. It's welcome to see the government coming to accept the need for a GST floor, but it's worrying that it's taken such efforts to achieve this. It's worrying that, when it's as plain as day, the government somehow still manages to avoid legislating what is clearly in the national interest until it's dragged, kicking and screaming, to do so. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It takes a great deal to unite state governments of all political persuasions. It's usually something that's fairly unique that unites Liberal and Labor governments alike, but on the matter of GST all states and territories came to the federal government asking for a legislative guarantee. All state and territory governments were united with the Australian Labor Party, and the government still considered it unnecessary. When the government finally came around, it was, quite frankly, clear that they simply couldn't avoid the necessity of this legislation. Consistent advocacy in campaigning showed that this legislation would ensure the wellbeing of Tasmanians and, indeed, all Australians protected under these changes to the distribution of GST revenues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes will ensure that the funds that Tasmanians rely on to fund their schools and hospitals do not go backwards. Thanks to the continual advocacy of so many other Tasmanians, we now have a commitment through to 2026-27 that our state's share will not go backwards. We do, however, remain concerned that a future Liberal government would act to ensure that after 2026 our GST share is no longer guaranteed. Yet, despite these concerns, it's unmistakable that we need legislation to put this debate to bed. That's why Labor supports this bill and that's why I'm rising to speak in support of the legislation. Labor's support of this legislation is needed to see much-needed certainty for all states and territories. That's why Labor will vote to support this bill and to ensure Tasmania gets its fair share of the GST.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to endorse the contribution from Julie Collins, the member for Franklin, in the other House. She put the government on notice that, when we get to the transition in 2026-27, we will be fighting for Tasmania again and we'll be insisting that our state continues to be no worse off. Indeed, we want to see our state much better off. We hope to see the outcomes, particularly in health and education, for Tasmanians improve. So I'm pleased to say we're able to support this bill today because of Labor leading and demanding that no-one be worse off and because of the pressure that we put on the Liberal state government and the Liberal senators from Tasmania to insist that this clause be in the legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  A very delightful passage from one of Australia's greatest literary masterpieces, by Mr Norman Lindsay in 1918, called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Magic Pudding</span>:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a tale of Bunyip Bluegum, who was seduced when walking through the bush by a pudding that he was quite unable to pass by. As the story goes, Bunyip Bluegum was seduced into eating the magic pudding, a pudding that never ended, a pudding that demanded eating. This tale has been popular with Australians and Australian children for nearly a century because, I think, we understand the intuition, the seduction, the attraction of a magic pudding—an endless source of nourishment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what we see with the GST debate. The GST has recently become a magic pudding. Well, who would have thought, fixing the problem with the GST, that there's not enough money to go around the states? Who would have thought the fix to the problem is more money? What a revelation! We've heard in this chamber that, obviously, the Labor Party are claiming this was their idea. They've been talking about more money now for some time. The question is: where is the money going to come from? That's the question that hasn't been answered in this chamber here tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's fine to say that we can fix the problem with a floor rate on the GST at 70c initially and then 75c so that no state is worse off. Intuitively, that sounds great. That makes a lot of sense. But this pool of funds that's allocated and shared across the states, based on a principle of fairness, a principle of equity and a principle of efficiency, has been, like the magic pudding, a source of seduction for so many states. If you read the tale of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Magic Pudding</span>—the Senate will adjourn in just over 10 minutes and you can get a copy of it online when you get home if you haven't read it for few years—you read the tales about the pudding thief. In fact, not just one pudding thief but numerous pudding thieves are all drawn to the seduction of the magic pudding. The idea of endless and limitless money is very, very relevant to this debate. I won't disclose straight away who I think the pudding thief is; I'll get to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk a little bit about why the GST has been so seductive and why it has led states such as Western Australia and New South Wales to claim they're not getting their fair share of the distribution. To go back a few steps, when the GST was brought in and the Commonwealth Grants Commission was set up, we had this principle—somewhat complicated and impressively named—of horizontal fiscal equalisation. The idea was that those states that didn't have the ability to raise revenue to pay for fair provision of services would be funded through the GST pool of contributions of other states. This principle is about our Federation, fundamentally. You can put all the technical and complex stuff aside; it was designed because we're a federation of states and territories in this country. As has been pointed out in this chamber, some states—for example, Western Australia—happened to be blessed and endowed with some of the world's greatest deposits of natural resources. Unlike Western Australia, my home state of Tasmania doesn't have such abundance of riches. However, we do have many other riches in abundance which I'll also get to a little bit later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very impressed to hear from Senator Dean Smith that he hopes that this is just the beginning of tax reform in this country and especially of debate on federal roles and responsibilities on tax reform. I'm very glad to hear that because it is exactly the point that I was going to raise tonight. Where do we go next with tax reform? The reason we've seen these changes to GST distribution is the impact over time of state based policies affecting the fairness and equity of the GST distributions. In theory, the efficiency principle was designed so that these contributions shared amongst states would help equalise different taxes across different states so that we did get, for example, some states leveraging much higher rates of payroll tax. We've talked chamber during the debate in the about revenue from pokies and the gambling industry, but there are a number of other levers that states can pull. It was deemed to be more efficient if the federal government made allocations of GST revenue to try to take pressure off some states having much higher rates of, for example, payroll tax, land tax, stamp duty or a number of the other levers that they can pull. I think most people agree with the principle of equity. Even the Productivity Commission, although it made a number of recommendations, admitted that generally most stakeholders agreed with the idea that through Federation we would have a fair system of allocating the distribution of the GST.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was outraged, as most Tasmanians were—and I'm sure Senator Colbeck here tonight also was outraged—when his Liberal state colleague Mr Barnett called my home state of Tasmania a 'mendicant' state. I note also, although it was designed I'm sure to get a headline, that Senator Leyonhjelm was out last night claiming that Tasmania and South Australia should be kicked out of the Federation because we can't pull our own weight. The whole idea is that we have a fair and equal Federation. At different times over the years different states have been net recipients of GST funds, and at other times they haven't been. It's well established that for a large number of years Western Australia was a net recipient of GST funds from other states. Then came the mining boom, and that situation changed. It's also been well established that it was actually the Western Australian government's policies around raising royalties that led to the rate of GST it received going down to 30 per cent. That's one of the issues that it has been claiming is a fundamental driver for changing the GST distribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we're talking about more reform, as Senator Dean Smith has put on the table, especially around the role of the federal government and the Federation, when are we going to start having a proper debate in this place about superprofit taxes? When will we start talking about properly fixing the petroleum resource rent tax? There is $240 billion in tax credits that has been clocked up by some of the biggest, wealthiest corporations on the planet and is sitting there to be deducted against future tax—if they ever pay any of that future tax. We've got a system where we have uplift rates that I note the government is looking at reducing. They are very, very high—15 per cent for exploration expenditure and five per cent for operating expenditure—which means essentially these deferred tax credits are going to get to who knows where? I'm looking forward to the next estimates so we can get an update on where they're at now. I'm guessing there will be over $300 billion in deferred tax credits—in other words, tax that's not going to be paid—through this very generous system. What about our mining superprofit tax? For those who were in the chamber back in 2012 and 2013 we had what I would agree was a much watered-down version because of the politics of this place. But the idea behind a superprofit tax, which came originally from the Henry tax review, is still a very good one. It is a tax that essentially is levied by the federal government. It could also be used to pay for schools and hospitals and be shared amongst the states. I notice we've actually had no debate at all in this place on this legislation about where we're going to go with superprofit taxes. So I look forward to hearing Senator Smith's contribution on this and whether he agrees that there's an enhanced role for the Commonwealth in fixing the petroleum rents rort tax, the PRRT, and implementing a superprofits tax on the mining resources that are owned by all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That leaves me with, I think, the most critical part of this bill that needs to be digested. Once we go past the forward estimates, the next five to 10 years, where is the money going to come from? We know their top-ups to the GST pool—this magic pudding—are going to come from consolidated revenue. They're going to come from future governments, whoever they might be. It may be the Liberal Party or it may be the Labor Party. I don't know if it will be the Greens party, but it will come from a future government. We have to deduce that those contributions are going to come from somewhere because, as we know, it's a zero-sum game.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at the track record of this government since the zombie budget cuts of 2013 right through to the present day, where we've even seen in recent weeks a whole number of revelations around cuts to basic services, such as the coalition's cut to the Foodbank charity of nearly 25 per cent—which I'm glad that the Prime Minister backed off on today. It was an issue that was even raised by the farming federation body themselves, especially around the impact it would have on drought-affected families. That's just one particular issue. What about cuts to the ABC and SBS? These cuts were of course outlined on <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> last night, I suppose with the revelation that those cuts were tied to the political content and goings on within the ABC—something to be probed very shortly by a Senate inquiry. We have also seen an efficiency dividend in place across the Public Service. We've seen no decent pay rises for public servants. We've seen job cuts right across the service, including at Centrelink and the ATO, leading to massive service failures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are cuts to Landcare and threatened species budgets of around $200 million a year. So, to save the species in this country, we have to beg German charities for funding for some of our most endangered animals. In my home state of Tasmania these cuts are very serious. I know Senator Duniam and Senator Colbeck are working overtime as Tasmanian senators to get the funding in place for NRM South and NRM Cradle Coast, who have also lost their funding. Why is that, considering the importance of these NRM groups? They are especially critical in a place like Tasmania. We don't know; we've got no decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have done everything they can to kick people with genuine needs off the disability pension and they have failed to raise Newstart. I'm wearing my $75 badge today. I didn't have large enough lapels to wear a larger badge, but that can be easily fixed when I get home and get one of my op shop suits. I warn senators that I have worn it once in here already and I'm prepared to do it again. For people who are living on the poverty line, $75 a week is not a big ask. Not only will it help these people who desperately need it; it will also help the economy—and we think that's a great priority. But the government are too stingy and too mean to raise Newstart at all. And let's not forget the revelations today about more devastating cuts to universities and the statements put out by the Tertiary Education Union. We are seeing cuts to schools, public hospitals and, sadly, more cuts to foreign aid. We've even seen money come out of the NDIS recently to go towards one of the government's pet projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's be honest: the magic pudding isn't so magic. There isn't an endless goodness in this pudding; it is limited. We know that the money has to come from somewhere once the GST top-ups start in a few years time. We have no idea where that money is going to come from, but I'll bet my bottom dollar that, if that money is allocated by a future Liberal government, it will come from the nation's most vulnerable and it will come from essential services. So it's not so magic after all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting" style="font-weight:bold;" />While the Greens will be supporting this bill and the intention of it, we will be closely scrutinising and keeping a very close eye on future allocations of funds, where they are going to come from and how we are going to pay for this. The Australian people need to understand—</span>

Presenting the petition was Fuzz Kitto, the national co-director of STOP THE TRAFFIK; and members of its Australian coalition. As some senators may be aware, STOP THE TRAFFIK is a coalition of over 30 organisations working together to prevent, disrupt and abolish modern slavery. STOP THE TRAFFIK has been actively engaging with members and senators on all sides of politics, as well as with business, industry, non-government organisations and consumers, regarding a modern slavery act for Australia. The petition, which I'll shortly present to the Senate tonight, is signed by 52,719 people from around Australia and the world, coordinated by Freedom United. It reads:</span>

Over a year ago we committed to a modern slavery act with penalties and an independent anti-slavery commissioner, an announcement warmly greeted by business, union and civil society stakeholders. Whilst Labor believe there are improvements that could be made to the Modern Slavery Bill, we do call on the government to bring this bill on for debate in the Senate, as it is vitally important for it to pass into law without further delay. Australia has an important role to play in fighting modern slavery. There are an estimated 40.3 million people in slavery worldwide, many of whom are victims of exploitation in private sector activities such as manufacturing, construction and agriculture. As mentioned in the text of the petition, almost two-thirds of people trapped in slavery worldwide are reported to be in the Asia-Pacific region, and it is estimated that there are thousands of people who are currently trapped in slavery right here in Australia. </span>

Often we don't hear much about the people who operate in what we call the backrooms of our political operations.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DUNIAM:</span>
                  </a>  as my colleagues Senator Polley and Senator Bilyk are acknowledging now. Brad is someone who has had a lot to do with the operations of the Liberal Party in Tasmania. He's a very skilled, disciplined and well-respected individual in our state, someone who is committed to the best outcomes for our state as well—and I'll come to some of the works that Brad's been a part of over the last 15 years in the state of Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brad originally came from the beautiful King Island, in the north-west of our state, which I'm sure my friend and colleague Senator Colbeck is very, very familiar with. That is the place where Brad landed his first job, editing the <span style="font-style:italic;">King Island Courier</span>. It is a wonderful publication that he edited with great vigour and a high level of thoroughness, which is a characteristic that has stayed with Brad throughout his entire career. A finger on the pulse, he was across every issue, and he was exceptional at what he did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following his time at the <span style="font-style:italic;">King Island Courier</span>, Brad joined the staff of Senator Eric Abetz and was with him for a number of years before joining the office of the then Tasmanian Leader of the Opposition, Will Hodgman, whom he stayed with for a number of years, between 2010 and 2018. Brad worked exceptionally hard during a very difficult period of time. I know both Senator Bilyk and Senator Polley would have an inside view of what it's like working inside the Tasmanian political system, as I do. It is difficult in opposition. There are no resources and there are, some might say, very substandard working conditions. But Brad worked exceptionally hard with members of the party—the members of the parliamentary Liberal Party as well—in Tasmania to turn the ship around. Brad was, if you like, the mastermind, the key architect, of the plans for the 2014 state election campaign. Those who have worked with Brad know the kind of bloke he is: a problem-solver; a listener; disciplined; someone who gets what ordinary Tasmanians are thinking about, what matters to them, and is able to translate that into political strategy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2014 election campaign, which I had the absolute pleasure of working for Brad on, as his deputy, was amazing. It had been 16 years of Labor government in our state, and the Labor government had been a very strong outfit, with a number of Labor premiers, so it was a tough ask. I'd been through a number of campaigns where we'd just missed out, so to clinch it the way we did in 2014 was a wonderful testament to Brad's work. We picked up an additional seat in every electorate apart from the electorate of Denison, which is a very tough one for the Liberal Party in Tasmania. Eventually, once the count was done, we'd picked up 15 of the 25 seats. The swing to the party that year was 12.23 per cent. It was a significant effort and something I think Brad should be very proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fast forward four years to 2018 and the election we've just had in our state. The Liberals again won a majority of the vote, 52.26 per cent. It is the first time in over two decades that a conservative party has won majority government for two elections in a row. It is a massive testament to Brad—and those around him—and the efforts that he made, the long hours that he contributed to the cause, supported so ably by his wife, Priscilla, and their four wonderful children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brad has left politics now, which is why I'm making this contribution tonight. He is part of the outside-of-politics fraternity. He's working for a firm in Hobart and he still interacts with us, but he's no longer a member of staff in any political office. So I take this opportunity, on behalf of Senator Colbeck and the other Tasmanian Liberal senators, to wish Brad well and thank him for what he did in our state. I'm sure we'll be hearing more about him and from him, probably in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercury</span> newspaper in the form of columns, which sometimes we'll be happy to read and other times not. Brad, we thank you for your efforts.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  I rise this evening to speak about the catastrophic state of the health system in my home state of Tasmania under the incompetent Hodgman Liberal government. Long gone are the rose-tinted days when my grandmother would pick the best flowers from her garden and walk them into the doctor's office. 'These are for you, to say thank you for taking care of my family,' she would say. How times have changed! Stories like this, of close relationships between families and those who care for us, have been filed away in the archives. This is really sad, because there are so many extremely passionate people working in health care who are doing their absolute best and, quite frankly, holding together a system that is in crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania has the oldest population and the highest rate of chronic illness in the country. Add our escalating hospital crisis, the specialist and general practitioner shortage and an incompetent Liberal government asleep at the wheel to the mix, and there is absolutely no doubt the system is at breaking point. Under the Hodgman Liberal government, our health system has spiralled downwards, with their record of inaction, withholding information, funding cuts and severely underfunding the health and hospital system only adding fuel to the fire. More than three damning reports highlighting the appalling state of our health system have now landed with a deafening thud on the Tasmanian health minister's desk. But, in true Liberal style, Minister Ferguson has pointed the finger and looked the other way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our nurses, doctors and other health professionals are at breaking point. They didn't sign up for this. They tell me they desperately want to provide the highest quality of care, which patients expect and deserve, but they can't because the system is broken and the minister isn't listening. The fact is that hospital staff are working seven days a week and routinely arriving for eight-hour shifts that turn into 12-hour shifts. It's hurting our nurses, and it's hurting Tasmanians that rely on the health and hospital system. But the Hodgman government refuses to act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To paint a picture, one Royal Hobart Hospital nurse said: 'When you go to work and we are already at level 4, you know that you will literally be running from start to finish. One shift I worked, we discharged 20 patients and accepted another 20 new ones from the emergency department within the space of eight hours. There was no patient-centred care for those patients on that shift. They just become names on a page, because that's all you have time for.' Another registered nurse said: 'It's just not good enough. We didn't become nurses to provide this level of care. We desperately want to be able to provide the high quality of care that our patients expect and deserve, but we can't because of the constant bed lock. The lack of inpatient beds means this unacceptable level of care is the new norm.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet the minister refuses to do anything. Every week new horror stories are emerging. We have paramedics trying to treat sick people in corridors and nurses performing invasive procedures on patients who are sitting shoulder to shoulder with complete strangers in the emergency department. Tasmanians drive past our hospitals every day and see ambulances queued on the hospital ramp and out onto the street. Our bed lock is so bad that more than 80 Tasmanians have lost their lives because they can't get the care that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every single Tasmanian has a right to access quality health care when they need it most. This includes palliative and end-of-life care. I note the Hodgman government's failure to deliver the standalone hospice in Launceston that is so desperately needed. The minister, when he was in opposition, gave a commitment to look seriously at the standalone hospice in Launceston, and since coming to government he has failed to act on that commitment. The government is now in its fifth year in office, and no excuse is accepted any longer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the campaign by the ANMF Tasmania branch and their tireless effort to bring a human face to the crisis. Their slogan, 'Bring your own bed,' is no laughing matter. The Morrison government isn't immune from criticism either. Let's not forget that, as Treasurer, Scott Morrison cut $715 million out of Australian public hospitals. I will not accept this deplorable level of treatment and care becoming the norm in the state that I love, and neither should the Liberal Hodgman and Morrison governments.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  It is with great sadness that I tonight reflect on the horrific tragedy that occurred in Bourke Street in Melbourne just last week. This is not the first time that such an attack has struck Melbourne; in fact, this is the third such incident I have spoken of in this chamber in the three short years that I've been here. Despite this, nothing could possibly have prepared us for what unfolded on Friday, when a man crazed with irrational hatred and hell-bent on destruction set fire to a vehicle and embarked on a stabbing spree before being obstructed by courageous bystanders and finally shot by Victoria Police. This man, whose name I will not dignify by mentioning it in this chamber—because he does not deserve to be recorded in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> and thus in history—injured two people and succeeded in taking the life of another, Sisto Malaspina.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since last Friday, much has been said about Sisto Malaspina. His Bourke Street restaurant, Pellegrini's, is a Melbourne institution. His contribution to Melbourne and the lives of so many Melburnians was profound. Pellegrini's has stood at the corner at the top end of Bourke Street for nearly half a century. Sisto and his co-owner, Nino Pangrazio, were regular faces behind the counter. They were never rushed and never too busy for a smile or a ciao, and certainly not for a cup of coffee. As it has for many other native Melburnians, Pellegrini's has featured in moments of my life, some seminal and others prosaic. As a truly awkward teenager I went to Pellegrini's on my first ever date, after seeing <span style="font-style:italic;">Amadeus </span>at the Greater Union Cinema down the road. I was desperate to look mature, so I ordered a cup of coffee, which was just so bitter. What I really wanted was a watermelon granita. That in fact was my children's favourite, along with spaghetti carbonara, which we would always have together each year after our annual visit to the Myer Christmas windows. In fact, I was last at Pellegrini's only three weeks ago, grabbing a late lunch of Pellegrini's ravioli after a Liberal Women's Council meeting, which, of course, requires comfort food afterwards. I sought shelter from the Melbourne rain at the counter in Pellegrini's. Sisto was there that day, as he was every other day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you read the tributes in the newspapers or on social media, you soon realise that Sisto's welcoming presence—he was so reliable and so predictable—was as much a part of the fabric of our city as the Flinders Street Station clocks, the Block Arcade, the MCG, the Nylex Clock, Phar Lap at the museum or a W-class tram. This small, busy restaurant and its happy, generous, big-hearted proprietor will forever remain part of the folklore of my beautiful and colourful city. So my heart goes out to the family and friends of Sisto Malaspina. I want to particularly acknowledge his business partner of more than 50 years, Nino Pangrazio, a man I have personally known and admired outside and beyond the doors of Pellegrini's for 20 years. Nino, your loss is so profound. So, to you and the Pellegrini's family, thank you for your beautiful and dignified response to this tragedy. Your grief is our grief and your pain is our pain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some, including the Premier of Victoria, who believe that acts like this must be accepted as part of contemporary Australia. I find such resignation unforgivable and insulting to those who selflessly risked their own lives to save the lives of others. Footage of the incident shows a courageous bystander approaching the attacker with a kerbside restaurant chair and distracting him while police regrouped. And who will ever forget the sight of Michael Rogers, who aided police by gallantly flinging a shopping trolley at the attacker? This civilian defiance and courage in the face of extraordinary, unpredictable danger suggests to me that acts like this that seek to spread terror and fear in our citizenry—acts of unspeakable violence like those my city has now been subject to three times in two years—will never be accepted as part of contemporary Australia. So I do not accept Premier Daniel Andrews's defeat. That's not my Melbourne and that's not my Australia. Sisto Malaspina's name will live on in the rich history of Melbourne, as will the indomitable spirit of Melburnians, and the name of his attacker will soon be forgotten.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on the motion of apology to victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, as I was unable to make a contribution yesterday. There are few crimes that are more destructive than the sexual abuse of a child. It's one of the greatest abuses of trust and power against people who are powerless to defend themselves. For many victims, it can lead to a lifetime of suffering or a life cut short through suicide or health consequences. While many survivors go on to lead happy, fulfilling lives, they remain emotionally scarred by the abuse they suffered. Although it is the perpetrators who bear the ultimate responsibility for these horrific crimes, we all have a responsibility to protect children from harm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are times when the parents or legal guardians of children entrust the care of their children to an institution—maybe a school, a church, a youth development organisation or even some form of institutional care. Sadly, many of these institutions throughout the course of our nation's history have failed shockingly to protect the children in their care from harm. Not only have they failed to stop the sexual abuse of children in their care; they have failed to investigate it, to report to it the authorities, to provide support to the victims and to stop further abuse. Even worse, many institutions actively sought to cover up the crime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The governments and parliaments of the Commonwealth, states and territories have a responsibility to put laws and regulations in place that will hold these institutions to account to ensure that they meet their care and protection responsibilities and that they face the consequences when they fail to do so. Yet successive governments and parliaments throughout Australia have also failed in their responsibility, and that is why an apology is necessary. The apology to victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse is not only necessary, it is well overdue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government, with the concurrence of the opposition and everyone in this parliament, has decided to offer this apology with contrition and sincerity, we must recognise that the hard work and advocacy of others has helped to bring it about. As co-convenor for many years of Parliamentarians Against Child Abuse and Neglect, PACAN, I have worked closely with advocates for child sexual abuse survivors such as the Blue Knot Foundation, the Alannah &amp; Madeline Foundation and the National Association for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect. I want to acknowledge the important role they have played in this process by advocating on behalf of the many survivors who struggled to speak for themselves. Also, the former Prime Minister Julia Gillard made the bold decision to establish the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Because of this decision, she will leave a lasting legacy in influencing how Australian institutions come to terms with past instances of child sexual abuse, prevent further abuse and deliver justice and healing when abuse occurs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most important contributors to this process were of course the survivors themselves. Without the participation of survivors it would have been impossible for the royal commission to expose the systematic failures and cover-ups and to come up with effective recommendations. The decision of thousands of survivors to participate in the process took incredible courage—courage which the rest of us could barely fathom. As painful as it was, they bravely chose to tell their stories to help protect others from future harm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the leaders in the Senate for this apology. In doing so, I add my own voice to the apology and say to the victims and survivors: we are truly sorry—sorry we failed to protect you, failed to believe you, failed to deliver justice to your abusers and accountability to the institutions you trusted to care for you, and failed to give you the support you needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The apology is a vital step in the healing process, but it's only part of the process. We need more than an apology; we need action. We need a national redress scheme that gives serious consideration to the recommendations of the royal commission and the needs of survivors. The Australian parliament and state and territory parliaments across the country need to take action to ensure that all institutions with a responsibility for the care of children are able to effectively protect those children from harm. There must be laws in place to ensure the institutions are accountable for the protection of children in their care. If they fail in that responsibility, there must be serious consequences. If we are truly sorry, then we will commit right now to working day in and day out to do everything we can to stop this evil crime. If this is going to be a sincere apology, then we must just as sincerely utter the words, 'Never again,' and mean them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  A few weeks ago I met a Singaporean man, Jolovan Wham—or, as he introduced himself, Jo—who was in Australia as a guest of United Voice, Amnesty International and the SEARCH Foundation. Jo came to Australia to share his story and advocate on behalf of one million low-wage migrant workers who contribute so much to Singapore's economy and society. During his visit, Jo met with a range of politicians from across political parties, as well as civil society organisations, NGOs and unions, including Union Aid Abroad, Unions NSW and the Maritime Union of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of Jo's stories on the lack of freedom of expression and assembly in Singapore and the lack of labour rights for migrant workers were truly horrifying. Jo is a social worker and former executive director of the Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics, or HOME. HOME is a Singaporean NGO committed to supporting and empowering migrant workers who suffer abuse and exploitation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we think of Singapore, we think of a small South-East Asian island state that has been a dynamic tiger economy for the past 40 years. Singapore is Australia's seventh-largest trading partner and fifth-largest foreign investor. Twenty thousand Australians call Singapore home. The attractiveness of Singapore for many Australian firms is as a tax haven—some Australian companies, like BHP, access concessionary corporate tax rates of just five per cent as a so-called marketing hub for their coal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Behind the glitz of the corporate world, there is a tragic underbelly in Singapore: the plight of the one million low-wage migrant workers. These workers hail from developing countries across Asia, such as India, Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia. They have travelled to Singapore seeking a chance to make some money to remit to their families. They make up 30 per cent of the Singapore labour force and they're in Singapore on precarious one- or two-year visas which can be cancelled by their employer at any time without showing cause. The one million low-wage migrant workers are crucial to most economic sectors, particularly construction, domestic work, manufacturing, retail services, cleaning and transport, such as buses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Singapore does not have minimum-wage legislation, and it is not uncommon for migrant workers to be paid as little as $2 per hour, even though Singapore is one of the richest countries, per capita, in the world. Without minimum-wage legislation, wage discrimination by nationality is endemic across industries, with migrants paid significantly less than Singaporeans for similar jobs. The precarious nature of their visas also means that migrant workers face numerous problems arising from lack of social protection, including debts owed to recruitment agencies, sometimes as high as $15,000; restrictions on movement; and confiscation of passports. Further, these workers often experience long working hours and physical, verbal and sexual abuse. The 240,000 female foreign domestic workers are excluded from the Employment Act, which means that they don't get mandatory days off, public holidays, annual leave or limits on their working hours. Domestic workers are also subjected to compulsory six-monthly pregnancy tests. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, there are virtually no independent unions in Singapore, and strikes are essentially not practised. The most recent strike by 100 migrant bus drivers resulted in the deportation of 29 workers, the jailing of four workers, reports of assault in police custody of two workers and reports of surveillance and intimidation of the workers and supporting activists by state intelligence services. It's not just industrial action that is suppressed in Singapore. Freedom of expression and assembly are severely curtailed in Singapore. Singapore's Public Order Act requires a police permit for any cause-related assembly if it is held in a public place, but such permits are routinely denied unless it is held at the government sanctioned space known as Speakers' Corner. Remarkably, the definition of an assembly includes one person acting alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government uses the Public Order Act, the Sedition Act, the Broadcasting Act, the Penal Code and laws on criminal contempt of court to silence dissidents. Opposition parliamentarians face the threat of legal suits from the government and its members. In the past, this has bankrupted politicians, preventing them from running for election. Currently, the only opposition members of parliament face a suit in the courts which has already cost $600,000 in legal fees and in which authorities are seeking $30 million in damages. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jo Wham has experienced the brunt of Singapore's legal mechanisms to blunt freedom of expression and assembly. Jo was found guilty of scandalising the judiciary for making the following statement on Facebook: 'Malaysian judges are more independent than Singapore's for cases with political implications.' He faces a maximum fine of $100,000 for this offence—for one Facebook post of a basic opinion. Jo has also been charged for: organising a public talk without a permit; organising a tiny protest on a train to commemorate the 30th anniversary of a security crackdown; organising a small public vigil outside a prison complex for a man who was to be executed the next day; and failing to sign police statements, because he wasn't given a copy of those said statements.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is vital that in this place we call out our friends when their behaviour is not up to scratch. It is vital that, in seeking to defend the rights of migrant workers in our country, we defend the rights of migrant workers across our region. It is vital that, in pursuing our democratic project in Australia, we share strong values of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly with our friends. Of course, without freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, there is little that people in Singapore can do to activate large-scale change in support of migrant workers. I thank Jo Wham for visiting Australia and sharing his story, for sharing the work of the incredible people at HOME and for shining a light on the tragic underbelly in Singapore—the plight of the one million low-paid migrant workers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:51</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on the lived experiences of people in our community living on Newstart and other income support payments. During Anti-Poverty Week, the Greens bill to raise Newstart and other income support payments by $75 per week was debated. If passed, this would have been the first real increase to the payment in almost 25 years. An increase to Newstart would have a huge impact on the physical and mental wellbeing of those trying to survive on it. It is unacceptable that there are people in a country as wealthy as Australia who are living on as little as $38 a day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what does it mean to actually live on as little as $38 a day? When I have, in this chamber, asked various ministers in question time whether or not they could survive on $38 a day, they have refused to answer. So, to give the government and the opposition an understanding of what it's like to live on Newstart, I asked the community to send me their experiences. The letters and the emails that I have received have highlighted the desperation many income support recipients feel. These are the people we need to be listening to in order to understand the difference that an increase of $75 a week would make to the lives of people looking for work who are single parents—predominantly, of course, single mothers—students, disabled people and older Australians. People in our community feel on edge struggling to pay their bills, driven there by the constant fear of income reviews and debts being imposed due to no error of their own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an overwhelming sense of sadness in reading the letters and emails. Many people are literally near breaking point, unable to find themselves on a path to financial security, employment or general wellbeing. This is Tara's experience:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">It began in 2013 when my youngest daughter turned 8 and I was thrown onto Newstart allowance from Parenting payment. I can't remember exactly the financial loss but I think it was around $120 a fortnight. Previously, my budget was tight but manageable, I had a job, 30 hours a fortnight, and a 5 year plan to be debt free and off Centrelink by the time my daughter began secondary school. I also had health insurance and a AAA credit rating.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Fast forward 5 years, I have moved 3,000km across Australia in 2018 to find work and better opportunities for my children. I have hardship arrangements in place for my $15,000+ debt, no health insurance, only 3rd party car insurance, rotting teeth and a daughter with social anxiety that is nearly at the end of her 10 bulk billed psychologist appointments. My 17 year old is forced to work to help.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I am 57 and my body is destroyed after decades on the tools. My insurer's assessors accept the evidence. I have 20 points. Disability job providers say I can work only up to 8 hrs a week, but not likely that. I am rotting on $485 a fortnight. Robodebt garnered Newstart.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is how desperate people are feeling on Newstart. People told us of the stress, loneliness and anxiety they feel, living under restrictive conditions. They want to work and they want to contribute. They find themselves falling into a cycle of ill health that traps them in a system and compounds their feeling of being a burden on society.

                <span class="HPS-Small">That is the hidden cost of poverty and housing insecurity: ill health. One way or another we are a 'burden' on the system.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recipients of income support payments struggle to pay even basic living costs. Being unable to cover the cost of food, rent and electricity is the harsh reality for so many. Debts continue to accumulate, increasing the stress and anxiety for those who live literally from payment to payment. This is the experience of a 45-year-old mother of two girls who asked to remain anonymous due to the sense of shame and sense of failure that she says she feels as a result of being on Newstart:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm a 45 year old single parent of two girls. I have been studying a Masters Degree in Human Rights and am currently completing my dissertation. I also undertake voluntary work. I am undertaking this in the hopes that it leads to work with a liveable wage. I have been in paid employment for years with my past job held for 10 years. Since I've been out of paid work, I have been accumulating debt. My power bill is around $3000, I do make regular fortnightly payments to the power company. I pay $410 a week rent, once that's paid there isn't a lot left over for all other expenses. I struggle with food costs. Unless you have a well-paid job, it is so hard to maintain a basic standard of living as a single person. You don't expect to have a lot of money when you're receiving government assistance but you also don't expect to be accumulating debt for basic living costs. It's very hard to look for work when you're fighting to keep a roof over your head and are always deprived of money for transport costs once the bills are paid.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Living on $38 a day is so restrictive that, according to the Salvation Army's national Economic and Social Impact Survey 2018, Newstart recipients were left with only $17 a day to cover their expenses after paying for accommodation. This payment is pushing people into poverty. Another correspondent said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Newstart is so low that all I have been able to eat is salad for the last 5 years. I can only afford to eat toast for breakfast and can't afford to eat anything for lunch. Newstart is causing me to be discriminated against when it comes to finding a place to rent as Landlords don't believe the Newstart payment will adequately pay the rent.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Medical visits are confined to emergency visits alone and even visits to ER at a public hospital, so I avoid any bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Raising the rate of Newstart, youth allowance and other income support payments will give these Australians a reprieve. It will allow them to afford the basics they need to attend job interviews with confidence. It will allow them to afford a semblance of a social life. It will allow them to afford things that we all take for granted. Another correspondent said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Give ordinary people money and they will think: finally! I can afford to buy myself a pair of shoes! Great! I can afford to go to the dentist. Maybe I shall get a take away as a treat. All these things that would be possible …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What you've heard from these quotes about people's lived experience is that the low rate of Newstart is having a profound effect on Australians. It's affecting their mental health, which has been well documented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Research also carried out by Relationships Australia found that the lack of employment and/or accessing the social safety net is associated with a high risk of loneliness for both men and women. In the many letters received there has been a sense of hopelessness strongly expressed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and time again I have asked ministers in this chamber if they could survive on $38 a day. The truth is they don't understand what it means to live on an income support payment and what it is like not to be able to afford the basics. They don't understand the anxiety or the stress that comes with living from pay to pay. They don't understand the impact on the self-esteem of people who face the stigma of being on Newstart or the isolation that comes from not being able to afford to socialise with friends and family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a wealthy country like this, nobody should be forced to live in poverty or experience the poor quality of life that I have just articulated for you through people's lived experience. We don't need a review of the Newstart payment. We need an increase to that payment so that people are no longer forced to live in poverty.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:01</span>):  I rise to recognise the anniversary of one extraordinary Australian. All of us, in some way, wish we had the talent and dedication to represent our current country at the Olympic Games, but few of us succeed. All of us at some point must stand and either fight for our convictions or fly from them. Few stand like Peter Norman.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a single day in 1968, a young apprentice butcher from Coburg raised himself above the common bar of humanity and took Australia with him. The date of 16 October was the 50th anniversary of Norman's brilliant silver medal in the 200 metres at the 1968 Mexico Olympics. It was also the anniversary of his support of the silent protest by the United States gold and bronze medal winners, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, against black poverty and racial inequality in their country—heads bowed, barefoot and each with one gloved fist raised. It is one of the most iconic images of the 20th century.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Peter Norman finished the 200-metre final in 20.06 seconds, blazing like a comet to the line in a time that would have won him gold at the Sydney 2000 Olympics. It remains an unbroken Australian record. Just before the medal presentation, Smith and Carlos told Norman about their plans to protest peacefully during the medal ceremony to focus world attention on the struggle for equality. 'I will stand with you,' the Australian said. 'In his eyes,' Carlos recalled in his eulogy at Norman's funeral, 'I saw only love.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Norman helped create the symbolism of the moment by suggesting that the two Americans could share their only pair of gloves. On the way to the dais, Norman also borrowed an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge and pinned it to his tracksuit. In the simple act of wearing that badge, Peter Norman showed his fellow athletes and the watching world that the courageous actions of one person makes a difference. Uniquely for an Australian, Peter Norman stood at the very centre of the global stage, where his conscience demanded, for a cause that was not his own, with no precedent to inspire him and no incentive to motivate him other than his commitment to human rights. Like Smith and Carlos, he paid for that commitment. Shunned on his return from Mexico City, his role in the protest effectively cost him his career. While he did compete in the 1970 Commonwealth Games, he was not sent to the 1972 Munich Olympics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Olympic Committee did not invite him to participate in any way on any day at the Sydney 2000 Olympics. It was the United States Olympics team who included him in their Sydney Olympics celebrations. When Peter Norman died in 2006, Tommie Smith and John Carlos flew to Melbourne to be pallbearers and deliver eulogies at his funeral. The USA Track &amp; Field federation declared 9 October, the day of Norman's funeral, Peter Norman Day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My parliamentary colleague and friend Andrew Leigh MP, in October 2012, in the other place moved a motion recognising Peter Norman's extraordinary athletic achievements, acknowledging his bravery and apologising for his mistreatment. It was passed unanimously. Now the Daniel Andrews Victorian Labor government, in partnership with Athletics Australia, has announced it will honour this sporting hero, Peter Norman, by striking a bronze statue at the Lakeside Stadium in Melbourne. I am really proud of Daniel Andrews for making this decision so that finally Peter Norman will be respected for the stand he took and so that Australia can recognise his courage in memoriam.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In athletic and humanitarian terms, from Edwin Flack to Cathy Freeman, Peter Norman is the noblest embodiment of Australia's Olympic ideal. First among equals, his hour in Mexico City abides as the finest Australian achievement at any Olympic Games. Not only was he faster, stronger and standing higher than any of us; he was brave for all of us. He put on display—for the world to realise—that sometimes you have to stand up for what you think is right. On behalf of Australia, thank you, Peter Norman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to share another important anniversary with the Senate. Last month marked an important anniversary in the fight for equality in Tasmania. Thirty years ago my friend Rodney Croome, along with 130 other people, was arrested at Hobart's iconic Salamanca Market for defending a small stall promoting gay law reform. People were arrested for displaying the word 'gay' or 'lesbian' or wearing material that displayed a pink triangle, a symbol used previously by the Nazis to identify homosexual men imprisoned in concentration camps but reclaimed by activists in the 1970s and 1980s to represent collective pride and protest. Three years later, in 1991, Croome and Nicholas Toonen took the Australian government to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, claiming Tasmania's laws were in breach of articles 17 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Toonen's landmark claim prevailed, but it would not be until 1997, six years after the claim was filed and almost a decade after Croome's arrest, that homosexuality would be decriminalised in Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 30 years, Tasmania has gone from being the last state to decriminalise homosexuality and adopt discrimination laws to being Australia's most progressive. Tasmania was the first to allow civil unions and show support for same-sex marriage, with Rodney Croome himself recently describing our laws as gold standard. But, if Tasmania's laws are gold standard, what of the other states and the Commonwealth? Isn't it offensive that in this day and age a dichotomy between our jurisdictions can still exist for LBGTI equality? The fact that we had to have a plebiscite for marriage equality, held one year ago this week, demonstrates that we still live in a legal and social landscape that does not always adequately value and respect the human rights of LBGTI people. But, as history now shows, the Australian people wanted marriage equality and the human rights of LBGTI people respected. Yet it's not over. The recent hyperbole that arose from the Ruddock Religious Freedom Review only highlighted the prejudice that continues to ferment below the surface. It fleshed out the ways in which Australian law still grants religious bodies the right to exercise sexual discrimination, whereas Tasmania is the only state that prohibits all forms of discrimination against LBGTI people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery in Hobart, there is a moving exhibition currently on display, commemorating the Salamanca protests some 30 years ago with original photographs, police documents and protest materials from that 1988 event. To this day, the Gay and Lesbian Rights Group continues to operate every Saturday at Tasmania's Salamanca Market. I think these anniversaries are an opportunity for us to reflect on our values around sexuality, relationships and humanity. They're an opportunity for us to realise the magnitude of discrimination that the LBGTI community continues to experience, and to progress reform towards an equal future free from harm.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BURSTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:09</span>):  I have in my possession a voluntary administrators report to creditors for Endeavour Industries, a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee and a registered charity in the Hunter Valley township of Maitland, as well as several other Hunter locations. Mitchell Griffiths and Chad Rapsey of Rapsey Griffiths were appointed administrators on 4 June 2018. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It must be noted that Endeavour had been operating profitably for 50 years under the guidance of a voluntary board. Chairperson Mr Andrew Hughes joined the Endeavour board on 10 November 2014, just before the rollout of the NDIS in the Maitland region. He instigated the implementation of a new constitution on 16 June 2015, to reflect payment to directors. Mr Hughes is also chairperson of Kurri Kurri Community Services, KKCS, a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee and a registered charity located in Kurri Kurri. It's been operating for more than 30 years under the guidance of a volunteer board. Mr Hughes joined the Kurri Kurri Community Services board in 2016, just before the rollout of the NDIS in the Cessnock-Kurri Kurri region. He also instigated the implementation of a new constitution, on 23 August 2016, to reflect payment to directors. Neither organisation sought the minister's approval for directors to be paid, as is required by law. Any payment to directors is therefore fraudulent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were three directors of Endeavour—Andrew Hughes, Sally Coddington and Danny Litwin—at the time of the appointment of the administrator. Sally Coddington is the wife of Kurri Kurri Community Services CEO Mike Coddington. Nowhere in the report does it detail the amounts paid to directors, but I understand they were paid in the order of $3,000 per meeting. Mr Hughes, a former lawyer, describes himself as a motivational speaker deriving income from government affiliates as well as the private sector. He boasts qualifications in NLP, or neurolinguistic programming. There is no scientific evidence supporting claims made by NLP advocates. It is a con. Mr. Hughes has surrounded himself with close friends and associates on both boards, and they are all deriving benefits that enhance their lifestyles. His presence at Endeavour has been a miserable failure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Annexure A of the administrators report details a 'Declaration of Independence, Relevant Relationships and Indemnities'. On page 7 of the report, under the same heading, the administrator admits to a relationship not listed in annexure A, and describes it as 'an engagement undertaken by our firm between May 2016 and August 2016'. What it doesn't say is key to any considerations: Mitchell Griffiths worked as acting CEO of KKCS for that period, on an attractive remuneration, working side by side with Andrew Hughes—they are good friends. I believe Rapsey Griffiths has a pecuniary conflict of interest and should not be in the position of administrators. Endeavour leases real property from KKCS and is indebted for the amount of $17,329. KKCS was not reported as a creditor at the time of the administrators' engagement. Was this illegal collusion between organisations?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Endeavour received funding from the Department of Social Services for the sum of $425,655 from the supported accommodation fund. This has not been expended and is being called in. No doubt this money was used to prop up the business due to lack of liquidity. With less than $150,000 in the bank, Endeavour is unable to return the funds. Where else would the money have been spent?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Endeavour accrued losses of $2.67 million from 30 June 2015 to May 2018. Management estimated that it had been accruing losses of $130,000 a month yet continued to trade. The administrators' report states that the company began displaying indicators of insolvency as early as 30 June 2015 and may have become insolvent in February 2018. There was plenty of time from 2015 to right the ship, but the directors were more concerned with what they could get out of it for themselves. The directors have failed their fiduciary duty, and compensation ought to be sought from them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Any thoughts of KKCS taking over any Endeavour services should be dismissed for obvious reasons. The relationship between Mike Coddington and Sally Coddington and the relationship that Andrew Hughes has with both parties should disqualify KKCS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On pages 31 and 33 of the report, the administrators say, 'We do not anticipate that a liquidator is likely to bring a claim for insolvent trading.' Then, on page 36, they say, 'We propose that we, Mitchell Griffiths and Chad Rapsey, will be appointed as liquidators of the company.' There is no doubt that Mitchell Griffiths is going to look after his mate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The board has destroyed Endeavour and the lives of its employees and those with a disability who accessed it. If the administrators' recommendations are followed, Endeavour will no longer exist. The directors must be held accountable. The administrators have listed their fees as at 28 September 2018 as $678,373.09, with further administrator and liquidator fees in the vicinity of $100,000 and $200,000, all ex-GST—a total of around $1 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that the administrator intends to let Andrew Hughes and his sidekicks off the hook. I can picture Andrew Hughes, with his arm around his mate's shoulder, saying, 'Thanks a million, Mitch.' Andrew Hughes and KKCS CEO Mike Coddington should stand aside from their respective roles at KKCS due to conflicts of interest. The real tragedy of the situation is the loss of jobs and the displacement of those with disability. Andrew Hughes, Sally Coddington and Danny Litwin should be forever banned from standing for any type of board. I believe this justifies a Senate inquiry.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:17</span>):  I'm sure you'll be as surprised as I was, Mr Acting Deputy President Brockman, to find out that when children aged nine to 11 were asked to draw a scientist two-thirds of them drew a man. Did you know that only around one-third of girls in year 4 in Australia were confident in their maths ability, compared to 42 per cent of boys in year 4? Let me say that this is not a phenomenon that is internationally consistent. We're talking about a particularly Australian phenomenon. I'm sure you've heard this one all too often in Australia: 'Girls aren't good at maths or science.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should all know well by now that biological sex does not innately affect one's potential to succeed and achieve in science, technology, engineering or mathematics, but stereotypes and a lack of confidence are impacting on the decisions and choices that our boys and girls are making. Take this statistic, for example: boys are three times more likely than girls to choose physics in year 12 and nearly twice as likely as girls to choose advanced mathematics in year 12. All of this matters for our nation—for the advancement of the innate capacities that our population holds and for our economic outcomes as well. We need girls engaged in STEM because it's simply unfair that gender limits choice. More than this, we need girls engaged in STEM because it is critical for their future economic security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Labor's shadow assistant minister for innovation, I'm passionate about changing the underrepresentation of girls and women in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. I have been meeting with inspiring and remarkable women in STEM who are at the forefront of ideas and innovation, and they are doing their bit towards transforming the nation. They have made it very clear to me that much more needs to be done to ensure the deep-rooted issues at the heart of the underrepresentation of women in STEM are finally solved. When it comes to participation and approaches to studying or working in STEM, there is a gender divide. Sadly this gender divide can be observed very early in the educational decisions made by our girls and boys. Whilst progress has happened here in Australia, we are nowhere near where we need to be to achieve gender parity in STEM, which we know has been achieved in similar contexts in other jurisdictions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is largely because obstacles for girls in STEM have deeply entrenched societal, cultural and institutional roots. We know that these things are notoriously difficult to change and reshape. Unfortunately we saw this eventuate in the last month when the Prime Minister's Prizes for Science 2018 were announced. The prizes recognise the contributions that scientists, innovators and science teachers make to Australia's scientific and commercialisation capabilities. Of the 10 awardees, only one was a woman, Dr Lee Berger, but at estimates we were told that, of the 128 nominations, less than 27 per cent were women. That 27 per cent was the highest representation of women on record, but it didn't translate to a recognition of awardees at a similar rate. This has to change, and it will be hard work, but it's work that we must do, because our girls need all of us to do better and we need to secure their future economic security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to put on the record today a little bit of an update on some of the work that I've been doing with people from around the country with regard to eating disorders and particularly to record the perspective of young people. This is because, while eating disorders know no boundaries of age or gender and can occur in men and women of all ages, young people are those at highest risk. Every single year for the last two decades Mission Australia's National Youth Survey consistently indicates that body image is one of the top three concerns of young men and of young women. Young people with body dissatisfaction are more vulnerable to disordered eating and more vulnerable to developing eating disorders. Research tells us that most young people know at least one other young person who they think might have an eating disorder. We know that body dissatisfaction and eating disorders can profoundly affect a young person's ability to participate and succeed at school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that Minister Hunt has labelled a personal priority. Last year Minister Hunt tasked the Medicare Benefits Schedule Review Taskforce to investigate options for Medicare coverage for the treatment needs of those living with an eating disorder. Labor welcomed this inquiry and remains supportive of it. Minister Hunt made an explicit commitment to providing more Medicare support for all Australians living with an eating disorder by 30 November 2018. That date is rapidly approaching. Minister Hunt stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… we have to change that paradigm and provide more services and more Medicare support in order to do that, and I am confident that over the course of the next year we will achieve that outcome.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was the Grace Groom Memorial Oration that he gave last year on 30 November, and Labor was pleased with this, but then during budget estimates in May the Department of Health advised that the MBS Review Taskforce had not submitted recommendations and that no costings had been undertaken. They stated that the task force was expected to submit its recommendations in late 2018. I note again for the record that 30 November 2018 is a deadline fast approaching. Minister Hunt must deliver on his commitment to create a plan for a specific treatment for all Australians who are living with eating disorders. Minister Hunt must match his words with real action for the more than one million Australian men and women living with an eating disorder. The impact that is felt is not just on that individual but, significantly, on their family, the people they work with and their friends who care about them and can see the struggles that they face with issues of access and with issues of competent and effective treatment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm concerned that the government will continue to do what it's done in this space, which is to talk a big game, to overpromise and to underdeliver. I'm very concerned that there should not be false hope but, rather, support for all Australians who need assistance with the treatment of eating disorders.</span>

                  <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:25</span>):  Tuesday, 20 November, is Transgender Day of Remembrance. It's a day to acknowledge, to commemorate and to remember those in the trans community whom we've lost to violence or to suicide. It's a day to take stock of where we are at and to look forward to better days ahead. In Australia and, indeed, around the world, trans people continue to face daily discrimination, violence and vilification—like during the current Victorian election campaign—from government, from senators in this place and even from our Prime Minister himself. It's estimated that around the world one transgender person is murdered every 29 hours—almost one life lost a day—and that number is increasing. It's worth noting that it's primarily trans women of colour who are being murdered. This is devastating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But is it any wonder that the number of trans people being murdered is increasing when transphobic, hateful bigots like Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro are being elected into high office around the world? In Australia, we have a Prime Minister who labels a program to help teachers identify trans and gender diverse kids as 'gender whisperers', saying, 'Let kids be kids.' Imagine being a young trans or gender diverse kid and seeing your Prime Minister talk about you in this way. We should let trans kids be safe to be trans kids. We have some schools telling trans kids they are broken, pressuring them to repress their true selves and wanting to continue to be able to expel them if they don't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of our most important responsibilities is to ensure that all of our young people get safely through school and are given the chance to optimise their education, skills and opportunities in life. Discrimination and potential expulsion from school do not help any young person get well set up for life. Statistics from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Trans Pathways</span> research report done by the Telethon Kids Institute make for sobering and essential reading. The report highlights the significant mental health challenges faced by trans young people as represented by the 859 Australians who participated in the research. They face challenges not because they are trans or gender diverse but because of the reaction from society to their gender identity. Some of the most concerning statistics include: that one in two young trans people—half!—have attempted suicide; that 80 per cent of young trans people have self-harmed; that 89 per cent have experienced peer rejection; and that 74 per cent have been bullied at school, university or TAFE. The Prime Minister—and all elected representatives—need only look at the statistics around young trans people's mental health to see that rhetoric of the kind we have seen from him is unacceptable and harmful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, in the face of the bigotry and hatred of some of our elected leaders, media organisations and sections of society, there is hope. So many incredible trans and gender diverse activists are leading the way in fighting for equality for all trans and gender diverse people. I commend you for your strength and your bravery. You're putting yourselves on the line in order to create a better future for all trans and gender-diverse people. I am proud to be part of the Australian Greens, a party that will always stand with you and fight alongside you for your rights. I say to all trans and gender-diverse people: we are committed to fighting with you to make your lives easier and safer so that you can thrive and have access to the health and other essential services you need. We are committed to eradicating violence and discrimination against trans people. We are committed to removing discriminatory requirements that prevent transgender people from affirming their gender on their birth certificates. We are committed to removing all discrimination against you in our laws and ensuring that programs to support you are rolled out in all schools across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this Transgender Day of Remembrance I remember the beautiful trans and gender-diverse people we have lost because our society refused to celebrate them. I commit to continue fighting arm in arm with our inspiring trans and gender-diverse activists so that the world is a safer and better place where we are proud of our diversity and where we celebrate every single one of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday, 24 November, the people in my home state of Victoria will go to the polls and have the opportunity to vote for the future they want for our great state. Labor has done well in marketing how progressive they are, but slick marketing cannot hide the truth. On so many important issues, it is hard to distinguish Labor from the Liberals. As they elect their next representatives in government, the choice for Victorians could not be clearer. They can vote for the old parties, who are beholden to their big corporate donors and will continue to act to please these vested interests, or they can vote for the Greens, who will fight for a future for all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A vote for the Greens is a vote to protect Victoria's stunning and precious native forests from logging. It's a vote for the unique animals that live in our forests and it's a vote for our future water security. The Greens will create the great forest national park and complete the shift of all of our wood production into sustainable plantations, ensuring a real future for the people working in the timber industry. As for Labor and the Liberals, they are excited to continue the devastating logging of our native forests, with the timber overwhelmingly ending up being pulverised into woodchips for paper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will fight for animal rights. We will ban duck shooting, jumps racing and greyhound racing. In contrast, Labor and the Liberals will continue taking donations from the racing and gambling industries. Actually, Labor will hand over $4 million in public money to the greyhound racing industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have got a plan to tackle dangerous global warming by shifting Victoria to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030, by doubling the Victorian Renewable Energy Targets, by phasing out all coal plants and by rolling out the wind and solar revolution across regional Victoria. In contrast, Labor will fast-track a new coal project, Labor and the Liberals support offshore gas drilling, and the Liberals want fracking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will invest in the public transport solutions Melbourne and the rest of Victoria so desperately need, like extending Melbourne Metro to provide rail services to people in the western and south-eastern suburbs, planning for Melbourne Metro 2, bringing our transport system back into public hands, upgrading all tram routes and providing 30 new high-capacity trams every year for the next 10 years. We will make cycling safe by building the metropolitan bike network. These are real congestion-busting solutions as our state grows. Labor and the Liberals will continue the rort of taking donations from the private toll road industry and then proceeding with expensive, polluting toll roads that will do nothing to solve congestion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will stop the sale of public housing to private property developers. We will build 80,000 public housing homes over 12 years to help end homelessness, and we will put a cap on rent increases of 2½ per cent and set minimum standards for rental properties. Labor and the Liberals will continue to sell off public housing land and refuse to cap rent increases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will work with public health and drug policy experts to develop a two-year pill-testing trial in Victoria, because we know the war on drugs has failed and pill testing saves lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to look at the voting records of the Greens and the Labor and Liberal parties in the Victorian parliament, let me summarise here. The Greens voted to stop discrimination against LGBTQI+ students and teachers in religious schools; the Andrews Labor government and the Liberal Party voted for discrimination. The Greens voted against offshore gas projects; Labor and Liberal voted for onshore gas projects. The Greens voted for a container deposit scheme; Labor and Liberal voted against a container deposit scheme. The Greens voted to save our precious public space in Federation Square from the Apple megastore, but Labor and Liberal voted for the Apple megastore. The Greens voted for an inquiry into the pokies industry; Labor and Liberal voted against that inquiry into an industry that donates massive amounts of money to both parties. This is why, this 24 November, I know that more Victorians than ever before will join me in voting 1 Greens for a future for all of us.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245759" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:35</span>):  Last week, it was my great pleasure to again travel through Central Queensland, an area I have spent a lot of time in over the past couple of years as the Labor duty senator, particularly in the electorate of Capricornia. I have mentioned on a number of occasions in the Senate that Central Queensland is a part of Australia that has gone through very tough times in the last couple of years, especially with the downturn in the mining industry, and it's really pleasing that pretty much across the region, over the last few months, you can definitely feel that the region is on its way back. There's more confidence among both businesspeople and local residents; you can see more economic activity happening, which is creating more jobs; and, in general, there is a renewed sense of hope across much, if not all, of Central Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been travelling with Labor's candidate for the seat of Capricornia, Russell Robertson, a fantastic candidate who comes out of the coalmining industry himself. For all of the lectures that we receive from the LNP about coal, there's nothing more coal than a coalminer, and that is who we're running as the Labor candidate in the electorate of Capricornia. So I was very pleased to join Russell, to begin with, in the town of Moranbah, a couple of hours inland in a very famous coalmining district. There we met with members and officials from the Isaac Regional Council to talk about what their council needs in terms of further support from the federal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also travelled to Sarina, which incidentally is the town in which my parents met, just south of Mackay. It is a great town, therefore. I'm sure Senator McKenzie will agree. It is a sugar town. It's produced a lot of great things. Some might say that I'm the exception to that rule! In Sarina, again we met with council representatives and tourism industry leaders to inspect a lot of the things that are being done to really revive that local economy, offer different types of jobs and bring different visitors through the town. We also inspected Sarina Hospital, which, as you would expect in a regional town, is a smaller hospital but is in great need of further investment to meet the growing population in that area. So it was very useful to get an idea of what the Sarina area's health needs are going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In both locations, Moranbah and Sarina, I was very pleased to join with Russell at a couple of Politics in the Pub sessions with local residents. We also did some mobile offices where we took all comers talking about all sorts of issues, from what's happening in their kids' schools to fishing restrictions to the future of the sugar industry and many other issues as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later in the week, I backed that up with a visit out to Biloela, also in Central Queensland but this time in the electorate of Flynn, where again we've got a great candidate running who I know Senator Ketter knows well. Our candidate there is Zac Beers, a terrific young man who's working very hard to give Flynn residents the representation they deserve. So I was pleased to join with Zac to help launch a brand-new branch of the Australian Labor Party in Biloela, a town that is not known as Labor heartland. It's fantastic to see that Labor is getting back up from the canvas, reinventing itself and getting new members in to help campaign in places like Biloela.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday, I was very pleased to join hundreds of local residents in the mining town of Moura, a famous town—unfortunately, famous more than anything else for the series of mine disasters and mine accidents that have occurred there over the years. I remember the reports of some of them from when I was a kid, hearing about mine explosions taking lots of lives unnecessarily. In fact, over the decades, 50 mineworkers have died on the job in the town of Moura due to mine explosions and other mining accidents. It was terrific to be with the local community as we all recognised the opening of a new miners memorial in Moura so that those 50 mineworkers who have died will never be forgotten. That memorial will act as a permanent reminder to all of us that every worker, no matter what job they do, deserves to come home safely from work. I really pay tribute to the local community, who have helped to build that memorial and raise the funds for that permanent reminder, going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that really struck me on that visit—and it repeated themes that I have heard a lot when I have spent time in Central Queensland over the last couple of years—was that it really didn't matter where we went in Central Queensland over those four days, whether it was Moranbah, Serena, Biloela, Moura or any of the other towns in between, because at our politics in the pub sessions, at the mobile offices or when we were talking to local shop owners about what was impacting on the local economy, the two issues that kept coming up as the scourge that Central Queensland continues to face were casualisation and labour hire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have talked a lot about these issues in this chamber in the time I have been here and I have said before that, when I was first elected, I was really struck by how widely entrenched labour hire had become as a form of work in Central Queensland, particularly in the mining industry. When you put that to mining companies, as I have, the excuse that you are always given is: 'The industry has been through tough times. We don't have the certainty to engage people on a permanent basis.' I have even had mining companies say to me recently that they expect the use of labour hire to decrease now that the industry is picking up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't accept for a moment that the mining companies are right in saying that they have no choice but to employ people through labour hire. I think they do have a choice and I think in many cases they are abusing loopholes in our current workplace laws which make it easy for companies to put people on short-term contracts, casual work arrangements and labour hire arrangements for no other reason than to cut their wages bill. The impact of that is being felt by workers who cannot get permanent work and also by their local communities and their local shops and businesses, because these workers don't have the kind of job security that people need in order to go and put money through the local pubs, the local shops and the local businesses. So it is actually impacting on everyone across these communities. As I say, it is really remarkable to me that, in all of the time that I have spent in Central Queensland, the issues of casualisation and labour hire keep on coming up, no matter where I travel to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a government, led by the LNP, which talks a lot about its support for the mining industry. But what you will never hear them talk about is their support for mining workers and their right to have permanent, decent, secure, well-paid jobs. You will never hear that. In all of the lecturing that we get from the LNP about the coal industry and the mining industry in general, not once will you hear an LNP senator stand up for the rights of mining workers to have permanent, full-time, secure, well-paid employment. We know that the reason for that is that, when the LNP say that they like mining, what they mean is that they like mining companies and mining owners; they don't actually care about mineworkers. If they did care about mining workers, they would actually legislate to crack down on the abuse of casualisation and labour hire that we see by so many mining companies across Central Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was good to have the opportunity last week to talk to mining workers in Central Queensland about the policies that Labor are putting forward as we come up to the next election. We have already committed to review and redraft the laws around casual employment. It is a nonsense that people can be kept on as casual employees year after year after year. This notion of permanent casuals is something that has really only been around for the last few years, while this government has been in place. That is not what casual work was intended for. People weren't expected to stay as casuals year after year. Labor are determined to crack down on that. Similarly, we are going to crack down on the abuse of labour hire, by making sure that, if you work in the same job as the person next to you who is employed permanently, you get the same pay—none of this rubbish about being paid a lower rate of pay or having worse terms and conditions just because you are a labour hire. You deserve the same pay and working conditions as the permanent worker who is standing next to you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll be honest: in talking to locals in Central Queensland, we met people who intended to vote for Labor and have always voted for Labor. I came across people who intended to vote for the LNP and—God forbid!—I even came across many people who were intending to vote for Pauline Hanson's One Nation party. What was really interesting was that when you got talking to people about One Nation and what they actually do down here in Canberra, as opposed to what they talk about back in Central Queensland, you could actually see the light bulbs go on with people. They don't necessarily know that every time she comes down to Canberra Pauline Hanson votes with the government. She has voted with the government 90 per cent of the time on legislation. Every time they've wanted to cut penalty rates, Pauline Hanson has been there to back them in. Every time they've wanted to cut apprenticeships, Pauline Hanson has been there to back them in. Every time they've failed to do anything about casual work and labour hire, despite Labor's pleading with the government to do something, who could the government rely on? Pauline Hanson. Every single time, she comes to their rescue and sells out workers in Central Queensland, no matter what she says when she is back up there. The reality is that the LNP's Michelle Landry in Capricornia and Pauline Hanson are two sides of the same coin—whichever way that coin spins, workers are being sold out. The only way to get real change is to vote Labor.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="76760" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GRIFF</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:45</span>):  I rise today to speak on the issue of suicide in Australia. The Australian Bureau of Statistics recently revealed that the suicide rate in 2017 spiked by nine per cent to 3,128 deaths last year. That was 3,128 Australians in such a state of pain and distress that they chose not to live. That number includes 98 children under the age of 18 who took their lives. These numbers only hint at the thousands upon thousands of family members and friends whose lives have been devastated by the loss of their loved ones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Suicide is a leading cause of death in Australia for those aged 15 to 44. To put that into context, deaths each year from suicide are nearly three times the national road toll, and suicide rates have been on an upward trajectory for well over a decade. Yet, as a nation, we have no dedicated minister for mental health to ensure this issue gets the focus it sorely needs. Neither do we have a national suicide reduction target. Other countries do; Australia doesn't. Of those Australians who have taken their own life, 40 per cent were suffering from depression, 30 per cent were suffering from drug and alcohol use disorders and almost 20 per cent were suffering from anxiety and stress related disorders. The suicide rate is higher for men than women, and Indigenous Australians have twice the rate of suicide compared to the broader population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the government has recently tasked the Productivity Commission with looking at the economic costs of mental illness. I await with interest the minister's announcement of the terms of reference for this. However, there are already concerns being expressed that this will be just another one of the myriad reviews that have been conducted into this issue with no tangible result in reducing the incidence of mental illness and suicide. What may be of more benefit was the announcement by the Australian Bureau of Statistics that in future, in addition to reporting health related causes such as depression, they intend to report on a range of social determinants such as financial difficulty and relationship stress as what they call 'associated factors to a suicide'. Parsed statistics on social determinants may finally focus us as a nation to confront the issue that many of those who have struggled with mental health and illness are all too aware of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this year's national report from the National Mental Health Commission, there are four social determinants that either strengthen or undermine the health and wellbeing of individuals and communities. These are early childhood development, fair employment and decent work, social protection and the living environment. Despite being one of the wealthiest nations on the planet, Australia's report card in these areas is very poor. For example, we are experiencing unprecedented numbers of child removals, with Indigenous families disproportionately affected. Those who have lost their jobs, and kids who are not even able to get a foothold on the employment ladder are being subjected to an increasingly punitive and humiliating red-tape regime in order to access meagre assistance to survive on—let alone with any semblance of dignity. Family violence and sexual violence, which occur across all ages and all socioeconomic and demographic groups, and which pose significant risk factors for mental health problems, continue to be a major issue in this country. It was reported last week that as many as one in four Australians are experiencing severe and damaging levels of loneliness. Rates of homelessness are growing exponentially and are now affecting over 100,000 people. Of course, there is also rampant substance abuse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is precisely because of the interrelatedness and complexity of these social determinants of mental health and wellbeing that I am calling for there to be a dedicated minister for mental health. This is a role which will need to work with and also be empowered to challenge the various ministers for families and communities, social services, health, veterans' affairs, agriculture and others. Such a ministerial position would ensure that impacts on mental health are appropriately considered and prioritised in these portfolios.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A minister for mental health is also needed to ensure that funding is spent effectively. The total expenditure on mental health related services by federal, state and territory governments has been increasing year on year for the past two decades and is now approaching $9 billion each year. According to the National Mental Health Commission, despite this spending, the prevalence of mental illness has barely changed, suggesting that the expenditure is insufficient or ineffective, or possibly both. A minister for mental health would provide a focal point for those in the mental health community to come forward with evidence based suicide prevention measures, to identify research gaps and to encourage the government to develop trials where we can compare and learn what works best. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also believe that government needs to set a suicide reduction target. In this regard, I echo the words of John Brogden, the former New South Wales opposition leader and now Chairman of Lifeline, when he stated that the increase in suicide deaths was an outrage. He has called for a 25 per cent suicide reduction target over the next five years, saying: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We need stark action and we need a breakthrough …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It will focus the governments, funders and the community on getting the numbers down and putting funding in all the right places.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Hunt has said suicide is a 'national tragedy' and: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">One life lost to suicide is one too many …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's office stated that the national target is zero suicides. Of course that is what we all want, but there is no plan to get there. I call on this parliament to reconsider and recognise the serious epidemic that we are facing. I point to the evidence of Scotland, which achieved an 18 per cent reduction in suicide deaths after setting a 20 per cent suicide reduction target over 10 years. They set that target when they became aware that the suicide rate in Scotland was much higher than comparable nations. But Scotland did not stop there. Realising the value of having a target to prevent unnecessary deaths, the government of Scotland has now set a new and more ambitious target. It aims to reduce the rate of suicide by a further 20 per cent by 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I call on the Australian government to act decisively and act now. It needs to set a robust target backed by a multipronged community centred plan to save the lives of our fellow Australians. We need a minister, we need a suicide reduction target and we all need to work together in order to prevent the scourge that is taking the lives of too many Australians and leaving in its wake a lifelong burden of loss and futile wondering for grief-stricken families and friends. We need to act now, as a matter of urgency, to implement a plan for ending this ongoing tragic loss of life.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:54</span>):  It is pretty incredible to think that today marks a full year since we began this journey together, after I was catapulted into this place completely by accident. I call this a journey for one simple reason: it is. It has been a year of incredible highs but also very challenging lows. This time last year, this place passed marriage equality legislation. So many had made their voices heard for so long and demanded an end to that discrimination. They had fought and finally they won. The repercussions of that damaging postal plebiscite are still being felt, as the faux religious freedom debate flounders on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had to battle some pretty entrenched views about disability, including views directed at me. It has been a slow and painful process watching the kinds of changes to accessibility and inclusion happen that should have happened from the very beginning in this building, the people's house. At times it has taken a personal toll, such as the ongoing failure of the government to address the violence, abuse and neglect that disabled people in institutional and residential settings endure. That sorry saga was a stark reminder that so many politicians are, for political convenience, still willing to sacrifice the opportunity to see justice done. This culture was no more evident than in that dark carnival of self-interested stupidity that saw Scott Morrison installed as PM earlier this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One year in, and I believe now more than I ever have that politics is not and should not be about self-interest and power, perks and pensions, jobs for the boys and cash-for-access dinners, corporate donations to fund the next election campaign to maintain power, and hedging bets by playing off one disadvantaged group of people against another for the sake of a few votes; politics should be about creating a future for all of us. I have been lucky enough in this last year to meet so many people, hear so many stories and see parts of WA that I never thought I would see. Again and again people have told me how disappointed they feel with politics and how sick they are of being shut out of the system simply because of their age, their postcode or how much money they make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A year ago I decided to crowdsource my first speech through Facebook by inviting folks to share what they would like to see changed in our community. We had an overwhelming response and I was so proud to bring the voices, needs and lived experiences of people into the Senate. It is a tradition that I proudly continue tonight. So, without further ado, I would like to introduce you to Kellie—and I can promise members of the government that this was, in fact, personal—who said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The very people you ignore will be the ones who vote you out. You are paid BY US to REPRESENT US. Get to it, or get packing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to introduce you to Ben, who contributed on Facebook:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Before we can rationally address ANY issue, we need to shine a light into the working heart of our government. We need a Federal ICAC and we need to sever the financial ties to politics from the powerful and wealthy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the inquiry into lowering the voting age, young people have told me over and over again about their hopes for the future, their frustrations with the present and their deep desire to be heard. And so many disabled people have reached out and simply asked me, in relation to the NDIS, 'Why is it that I have to fight the system that was created to support me?' These comments speak to the deeply held frustration and feeling that the way politics is done in this country is not good enough. And it is not good enough. We do deserve better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not good enough that, on any given night, there are 9,000 people in WA, a large number of them in communities like mine in Rockingham, who are sleeping rough on the streets. Twenty-five per cent of them are between the ages of 12 and 26. It is not good enough that young people in this country cannot find work or are forced into insecure work. It is not good enough that the price of education is going up while the quality of the education that you get at uni or TAFE is going down. It is not good enough that to be a disabled person in Australia is still to be subject to abuse and discrimination, to struggle to find work and go to school with everyone else and to constantly have to fight for the support and recognition you need to live a good life. And it is not good enough that our precious natural places are being destroyed and the safety of every human being on this planet is being put at risk to satisfy the greed of the fossil fuel industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But if there is one thing that this year has taught me, it is that there is hope. There is a better way. Despite the frustration and the disappointment, there is still enough optimism left in our communities. Together, there is hope. There is hope that we can change the direction we are heading in, and it is only the hope of people united that has ever created change. The last year has shown me that our community is diverse. We are different. We have different abilities and different passions, but, when we come together, we can achieve great things. We can stop the influence of corporations and lobbyists on our politics. We can invest money in services that we all need to live a good life. We can throw our arms open to the world and embrace those who come across the sea. We can travel the roads of truth, justice and healing with our First Nations peoples and we can create a movement for change. Thank you all for sharing this last year with me. We've got a lot more to accomplish together. Our journey is just beginning, and, as we head into the federal election campaign, I am so excited to see what comes next. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:03</span>):  Tonight I rise to raise a number of concerns about South Australian constituents who, as investors, have been financially affected by the passing of the Mining Amendments (ICAC Operations Jasper and Acacia) Bill 2014 in the New South Wales parliament. The passing of that bill essentially cancelled the exploration licences held by NuCoal Resources, disallowed any compensation rights for innocent shareholders and cleared the New South Wales government of liability for the conduct of the ministers and employees that had acted corruptly in the grant of the licence. In August, my colleague Senator Griff and I wrote to the New South Wales Premier about the issue, and the response gave us no joy and little information. It did, however, contain a commitment that the current New South Wales government position of not compensating NuCoal Resources shareholders for the cancellation of the coal exploration licence would stand. All up, more than 3,000 shareholders have been affected, including 184 from my home state of South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This travesty unfolded as follows. In 2010 NuCoal purchased Doyles Creek Mining, which owned exploration licence No. 7270. NuCoal intended to use this licence to establish a coalmine at Doyles Creek. Consequently, shareholders continued to invest in the company. Importantly, NuCoal reports that its due diligence process found that the licence had been granted legally to Doyles Creek Mining. In 2011 the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption, the NSW ICAC, investigated the granting of the exploration licence and found in February 2013 that it had been granted corruptly. In December 2013, the New South Wales ICAC made recommendations that the licence be expunged and that any legislation to that effect be accompanied by a power to compensate innocent persons affected by the expunging, such as shareholders. In response to the ICAC investigation and recommendations, the New South Wales government introduced the Mining Amendment (ICAC Operations Jasper and Acacia) Act 2014. Significantly, the New South Wales parliament was never told that the ICAC had recommended that shareholders be compensated. Indeed, claims have been raised in the New South Wales Legislative Council that the parliament was deliberately told the opposite by the then Premier Barry O'Farrell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In February this year, the Hon. Dr Peter Phelps MLC clearly recalled what occurred when he voted on the ICAC Mining Amendment (ICAC Operations Jasper and Acacia) Act 2014. Dr Phelps said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">After being called back to a sitting of this House at urgent notice by Premier O'Farrell, this House passed the ICAC bill which allowed for the expropriation without compensation. Why did we do that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Members of this House were told that we did that because it was a recommendation of ICAC.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The following day Dr Phelps expanded on his remarks, saying that at the time of the ICAC inquiry NuCoal had a capitalised value of $400 million. He told the House:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That capitalised value of $400 million at the time of the ICAC inquiry that led to the expropriation was reduced to $20 million. In other words, it was a 95 per cent cut in the capital value of that company because Barry O'Farrell introduced legislation under the false claim that he was giving effect to the findings of corruption, which we now know in this instance at least, to have been substantially false, or at least highly compromised by the activities of the ICAC itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is to Dr Phelps' credit that he is prepared to call out his own party on the issue. He finished his speech by saying that he will not be silent until shareholders get justice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, NuCoal is proposing that the New South Wales government appoint a retired senior judge to consider the facts and circumstances of the cancellation of exploration licence 7270 in 2014 and to recommend compensation for the innocent shareholders affected by the cancellation. With the New South Wales state election just months away, NuCoal is understandably urging those affected to contact their local New South Wales and federal MPs to highlight this unfairness. Senator Griff and I are more than happy to oblige.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've mentioned, we wrote to the New South Wales Premier about the issue in August. We stated that we were particularly concerned that the legislation cancelling the licence did not implement the New South Wales ICAC's recommendation to allow for the awarding of compensation to innocent parties. In the interests of fairness and equity, we implored the Premier to consider the effect the enactment of the legislation has had on the innocent shareholders of NuCoal and ask that she look favourably on its proposal to have a retired senior judge investigate the circumstances of the matter and make recommendations for the award of appropriate compensation. In the response from a departmental representative we were advised that the original decision was not taken lightly and that the government's position remained unchanged to that reached in 2014. With a state election looming, we can but hope that sanity may prevail and that a policy shift might yet emerge on all sides of New South Wales politics before polling day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Either way, for two reasons this situation cannot be allowed to stand. The first is that it's fundamentally unfair. Under section 51(xxxi) of the Australian Constitution, the Commonwealth can acquire property on just terms from the states or any person. In contrast, state parliaments have the power to take property without paying any compensation at all. Indeed, during the constitutional conventions that led to the federal Constitution, representatives from the states specifically advocated to preserve the power to take property without paying compensation. It's the sort of power one might expect to find in a communist state, where the state just takes what it wants. New South Wales has actually passed legislation in respect of 'just terms' compensation, but because it doesn't have a constitutional origin the provisions of other acts can specifically carve out the will of the New South Wales parliament. In the case of NuCoal, shamefully, the New South Wales government has used the provisions in an act to remove a fundamental right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second reason is that of the very serious allegation that the New South Wales parliament was deliberately misled when voting for the bill in 2014. In 1956, Baron Denning, considered to be among the greatest English judges of modern times, famously said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">No judgment of a court, no order of a Minister, can be allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the New South Wales parliament was deliberately misled in 2014, as has been alleged, then this is surely one of the greatest frauds in the history of that parliament—the defrauding of $400 million. Accordingly, the more we pick at it, the more it quickly unravels for all to see and the more the injustice will stand out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I call on the New South Wales Premier to show leadership on this. Premier, the response you gave me and my colleague, Senator Griff, was perfunctory at best. It showed a lack of compassion for your own constituents as well as for ours. It showed a lack of social integrity. It showed a lack of moral foundation. It showed a lack of judgement. It showed no appreciation for what is just. Madam Premier, you need to fix this. </span>
