              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that Falun Gong is a peaceful meditation practice based on the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Tolerance. Falun Gong practitioners in China have been subjected to the most brutal and relentless persecution by the Chinese Communist regime since July 1999, causing thousands to lose their lives from illegal detention and systematic torture. Such conduct stands in blatant violation of all international human rights charters that the Chinese government has itself ratified. According to investigative reports published by human rights lawyer David Matas and former Canadian Secretary of State for the Asia-Pacific; David Kilgour, tens of thousands of imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners have been subjected to forced organ harvesting for China's transplant market and lost their lives ( www.organharvestinvestigation.net ).</span>

Laos has been a communist state since 2 December 1975 following the forced abdication of the King.

M.A. Taheri is an Iranian theorist, researcher and scholar of complementary medicine. His teachings have been a source of inspiration and healing to countless people around the world. Arrested and imprisoned on irrational counts, he has never been given the opportunity for accessing a fair trial. His continued persecution is a gross violation of International Laws and Human Rights.

              <span class="HPS-Small">He wrote a letter from prison to the UN Special Rapporteur Dr Ahmed Shaheed in June 2014, and described injustice and violation of human rights against himself and other prisoners. The United Nations Secretary General recognizes him and mentions his name in Iranian yearly human rights report, and asks the Iranian authorities about his condition. An exclusive report by Amnesty International was released on Taheri in August 2014. He has been on hunger strike to protest against his illegal detainment, torture and severe inhumane conditions in prison.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia Post is relocating Craigieburn Post Office to new Craigieburn Central Shopping Centre. A franchised Post Office is located closer to new site than we are, and is not closing. I am not opposed to new location. Current location is an integral part of Shopping Centre and also is closer to industrial area on Hume Highway. Supports some 680 Postal Boxes. Post Office was established several decades ago and I was asked to assist in supporting and promoting the new venture. I also explained about the new Shopping Centre to be built at a later stage and I was given an assurance that it would not be relocated to our detriment. Elderly will be disadvantaged as they rely on Post Office .Current Post Office located close to Metropolitan Rail Hub and Bus service.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition of the residents of Forster Keys draws to the attention of the House the frustration we experience in obtaining affordable and robust internet connections. Forster Keys has over 500 homes in Forster NSW. Current cabling and infrastructure problems make connection to any ADSL solutions impossible for the majority of residents, Mobile solutions are expensive, unreliable and provide minimal download allocations compared to ADSL solutions for the same monthly cost. Current plans see Mobile access data allowance of 8Gb costing $55 per month compared to ADSL allowance of 100Gb for the same price.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As we do not appear in any NBN future plans we ask that an interim, cost effective, solution be considered. With the installation of a fixed wireless facility on Booti Hill we have been advised that the Forster Keys area could be covered in terms of reliable connection, but is not part of the allowable area. The current connection boundary is the Wallis Lake foreshore, which borders Forster Keys.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We feel that we are disadvantaged by connectivity issues peculiar to our small area in that the rest of Forster/Tuncurry, and now rural and small village residents to our south have vastly superior and cost effective options.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to allow Forster Keys residents to connect to the Booti tower as a temporary solution. This would allow us to access reliable, adequate and affordable connections until the NBN solution is available.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the six points in the petition mirror the recommendations made by the Australian Churches Refugee Taskforce in the report, 'Protecting the Lonely Children.' The department has considered this report and its recommendations. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that I take protection of children very seriously and am committed, as is the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, to ensuring that children are protected from abuse and exploitation.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Statutory child protection is the responsibility of the States and Territories and the department actively engages with relevant child welfare agencies on child protection matters. Service providers working with children in detention and the community must also, as a requirement under their contracts with the department, adhere to State and Territory legislation, including working with children checks. In addition, the department is seeking to finalise a robust and overarching children protection policy framework.</span>

This submission addresses many of the recommendations contained in the petition and outlines the services, policies and processes that provide children with appropriate levels of care, welfare and support, including the significant improvements made to these arrangements in recent years.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Ipswich One-stop Shop has joined 170 other locations across Australia that offer the full range of Medicare and Centrelink services in one location. The Department of Human Services (the department) is committed to improving the way people deal with the Australian Government by providing convenient, easy-to-access, coordinated services from a single point of contact. This will enhance access to services and reduce the need for customers to visit two locations.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, over 85 per cent of patient claims for GP services are lodged electronically at the doctor's practice, meaning most people can save a trip to Medicare by having their rebate transferred into their bank account directly while at the doctor's surgery. In fact, over the past two years, the number of people coming into the Ipswich Medicare shopfront has reduced by almost 40 per cent.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Dr Jensen</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 23 February 2015 about a petition received by the Standing Committee on Petitions on the treatment of animals in factory farms.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand that animal welfare is of great concern to the students and staff of the University of Western Australia and the Australian community. Animal welfare matters within Australia are the responsibility of state and territory governments and I am confident that the states and territories have robust arrangements in place, including animal welfare legislation, to address any allegations of farm animal cruelty. Investigations of alleged breaches of state and territory animal welfare legislation are carried out by the relevant enforcement agencies in each jurisdiction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is concerned about an escalation in illegal farm invasions carried out by animal activists to disrupt, harass, obstruct and interfere with lawful and legitimate fanning activities. This is not about stopping people publically raising concerns about animal welfare â€” they can continue to do so with relevant state or territory enforcement agencies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These illegal activities pose significant threats to on-farm biosecurity measures which increases health risks to animals, causes distress to farmers and their families, and results in poor welfare outcomes for animals on these farms.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I believe that just as people are not permitted to trespass on urban private properties they should not be able to do so on rural enterprises, many of which are farmers' family homes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government will continue to encourage state and territory governments to strengthen trespass laws and to seek a national approach to the protection of animal industries from disruptive and illegal activities undertaken by animal activists.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 23 February 2015 with regard to a petition recently submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions, regarding pharmacy services in the community of Longwarry.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition wishes to draw the attention of the House of Representatives to the disadvantage that the rural community of Longwarry faces by not having a chemist in the doctors clinic, and asks the House to do all in its power to: review the guidelines regarding chemists in rural communities; address the need for the Longwarry community to have a chemist in the doctors clinic; and allow the Longwarry community to have the best health care that other towns currently have.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All applications to establish a new pharmacy or relocate an existing pharmacy approved to supply pharmaceutical benefits must be considered by the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority (the Authority) against the requirements of the Pharmacy Location Rules (the Rules).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current Rules are in place until 30 June 2015 to coincide with the expiration of the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement between the Australian Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The composition of any future Rules will be considered as part of the negotiations for the Sixth Agreement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My Department has advised that an application to establish a new pharmacy in Longwarry was recently considered by the Authority, but that the Authority was unable to recommend that the application be approved as it was not satisfied that the application met the requirements of the Rules. The applicant has been advised of the Authority's decision.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The applicant is not prevented from making a new application for the Authority's consideration, addressing all of the requirements of the Rules, and in particular, those that they Authority identified as not being met in the earlier application. The applicant also has the right to seek an independent review of the Authority's decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where an application is unable to meet the requirements of the Rules and it has been formally rejected, the applicant pharmacist may request that I exercise my discretionary power to approve the pharmacist. My discretionary power is designed to address exceptional circumstances where there are unintended consequences of the application of the Rules. I can only exercise my power to approve a pharmacist if I am satisfied that a decision to not approve a pharmacist will result in a community being left without reasonable access to PBS medicines, and it is in the public interest to do so.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr JENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:05</span>):  Madam Speaker, an important part of the role of the Petitions Committee is conducting community engagement by holding public hearings with petitioners and occasionally visiting schools to discuss petitioning with students.  In my statement today I will discuss a recent school visit by the Petitions Committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 29 April, the Petitions Committee visited Hornsby Girls High School, in Sydney's northern suburbs.  While we were there, the committee conducted a public hearing exercise with Miss Olivia Kong and Miss Avanti Gomes, both year 11 students of Hornsby Girls High.  Olivia had organised a petition to the House on the subject of tertiary education reforms and Avanti helped to gather signatures. The committee also invited students from the school to observe this hearing and to watch a parliamentary committee in action. As a result, two classes of year 11 legal studies students observed the committee's discussion with Olivia and Avanti.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The hearing exercise was very successful. Both Olivia and Avanti displayed a very keen insight into the benefits of petitioning the House and the value that the House derives from receiving petitions. Their passion for the subject of their petition demonstrated a deep concern for their future and for the future of their country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was very pleasing to see these two young Australians so committed to making a difference, drawing the attention of the House to the issues that are important to them and the signatories to their petition.  I have no doubt that these girls and others like them represent the future leaders of this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During our discussion with Olivia and Avanti, they both provided some valuable feedback on the House's processes for dealing with petitions.  Aside from Olivia's pleasure at receiving physical mail from the committee updating her on the progress of her petitionâ€”increasingly less common in this digital ageâ€”she made some interesting points about the House's processes.  For example, Olivia noted that the committee's web page contains much useful information on preparing petitions, and that her inquiries to the committee secretariat were answered very quickly.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Olivia's experiences here are important.  They emphasise the value of visiting the committee's web page and contacting the committee secretariat before petitioners start to gather signatures on a petition.  By taking these steps, petitioners can help to ensure that their petitions will meet the House's requirements and that their petition will be referred to a minister for response.  As I have in previous statements, I would once again like to encourage anyone considering petitioning the House to contact the committee secretariat early in the preparation of their petition, as the feedback provided by the secretariat can be very useful in helping them to meet the House's requirements for petitions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Olivia and Avanti also mentioned that they were happy with the fact their petition received a response from the minister, in their case the Minister for Education.  While ministers are often not able to grant the requests made in petitions, the response is an important part of the petitioning process.  In the case of Olivia and Avanti, it gave them a clear statement of government policy on the issue of tertiary education reform, a statement which they can now use to engage in a discussion about the nature of these reforms with their fellow students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the public hearing exercise, the committee had a one-hour discussion with the students who attended. Again, the committee was impressed by the passion and engagement of these students. The discussion covered a wide range of issues, including young Australians' engagement with the House, education policy, the representation of women in politics, and the nature and responsibilities of Australian citizenship. Many of the students spoke with confidence and passion, on matters that were clearly very important to them.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the students and staff at Hornsby Girls High School for hosting our visit to their beautiful school. In particular, I would like to thank Olivia and Avanti for their work in conducting their petition, and in speaking to the committee about their experiences. I would also like to thank the school principal, Dr Justin Briggs, for his efforts in arranging our visit and for the kind hospitality he organised. Finally, I would like to thank all of the students who attended our visit to their school. Not only did they make us feel very welcome; they alsoâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is sometimes said that people do not value things for which they do not have to pay. Some people claim a price signal is needed, in order to understand the value of a service, but there are some things that are priceless: love, compassion, good health, friendship, fellow-feeling, human contact, community, happiness, making the world a better place. No-one needs a price signal to value those things, and anyone who volunteers knows that the rewards of volunteering can be much richer than anything that could be measured in money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not to say that money is not important. Our community gets an immense economic benefit from volunteers' work. For example, the 2008 <span style="font-style:italic;">Economic value of volunteering in Queensland</span> report estimated the total value of volunteering to the Queensland economy was over $13 billion. Volunteering Australia say 713 million hours are volunteered every year and they say that, from the organisations registered with Volunteering Australia alone, there are more than six million Australians who volunteer. But numbers alone are not enough when telling the story of what volunteering really means.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The week of 11 Mayâ€”in this place budget weekâ€”was National Volunteer Week. While we talked about numbers, cuts, and costs, Australia was recognising the real benefits of volunteering. This year's theme was 'Give Happy, Live Happy.' You could not have a more relevant expression of what volunteering means. In launching National Volunteer Week, Volunteering Australia's CEO Brett Williams OAM said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Research tells us that volunteering makes a difference in people's happiness. It's proven that volunteers are happier, healthier and even sleep better than those who don't volunteer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia was ranked No. 10 in the latest World Happiness Report, and Mr Williams says that has a lot to do with Australia's dedicated volunteers. The sense of belonging, of making a contribution, of helping others, that you get from volunteering can be an important part of a rich life as a member of a community and a society. And it is not only happiness; volunteers also get a chance to develop their skills, experience and alternative perspectives that are equally useful in paid employment and other situations. So volunteers get personal, individual rewards more valuable than money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the happiness does not end with the volunteers themselves. Volunteers genuinely want to make the world a better place, and they give their own labour freely for that purpose. There are not too many things that a person can give that are more valuable than time out of their lives and effort. They want a healthier, stronger, safer, better place to live. They want to reduce the sum of misery in the world and in doing so they spread happiness. Take those who volunteer in environmental groups like my local conservation groups such as B4C, which is the Bulimba Creek Catchment Coordinating Committee, and N4C, the Norman Creek Catchment Coordinating Committee. Their conservation work will reap rewards for future generations long after their own lifetimes. It is the definition of altruistic. As another example, consider Meals on Wheels. Like Meals on Wheels groups around the country, my locals provide much more than just a meal. Their volunteers make contact with elderly people at risk not just of malnutrition but of isolation and loneliness. The members of clubs like Rotary, the Lions, Zonta, the Soroptimists, Quota and other similar clubs build local communities and contribute to international development. Management committee members and directors of not-for-profits give their own time and expertise freely. In my own life I have volunteered as a director of the YWCA in Queensland and as a volunteer management committee member of Children by Choiceâ€”both not-for-profit organisations that do important work in our community. And of course there are so many other organisations and individuals freely giving their time to make the community and the world better. Not only are volunteers happier people, they are making life better for everyone else, whether locally or internationally. Our community is therefore rightly grateful to those who volunteer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During National Volunteer Week, there were thousands of events across the country to say thank you to the more than six million Australians who volunteer. Like volunteers themselves, the events were diverse. There were thankyou breakfasts, morning teas and sausage sizzles, as well as open days, awards ceremonies, street parades, garden parties and movie nights. I know, Madam Speaker, that you also held an event during that period to recognise the work of many of the peak bodies who perform such great not-for-profit services in our communityâ€”an event I was very honoured to attend. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to thank everyone who volunteers. Whether you are volunteering in a small community based organisation or a large not-for-profit, whether you are giving your time or your expertise or lending out your ute so that the volunteer organisation can operate well, whether it is cooking at the sausage sizzle at the community Christmas carols night or helping out at something like MDAâ€”a refugee organisation in my communityâ€”I want to thank you. May you continue to give happy, to live happy and to make the world a better place.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs SUDMALIS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>): There is nothing quite as special as being a volunteer. Today is a unique chance to say thank you to all those amazing people. If we did not have our band of volunteers, there are many whose lives would be that much poorer. The National Volunteers Week theme this year was 'Give Happy, Live Happy'â€”and this is the essence of being a volunteer. If you are able to give your time, make someone else's life a little better, then you yourself are actually one of the beneficiaries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteers are extraordinary people with big hearts. They offer the gift of their time to teach, to listen, to help, to inspire, to build, to grow and to learn. But so many more people could join the ranks of being a volunteer. They just need to have the confidence to say, 'I think I can do that and I know I can help.' The PCYC in the Shoalhaven could do with some volunteers to help in the officeâ€”perhaps with some supervision, perhaps with the activities. Volunteers do not expect to be paid, yet the value of their work is beyond measure. Collectively, these volunteers have planted tiny seeds of inspiration in countless lives. We have many volunteers in our schools, for breakfast programs and for reading programs. There are volunteers to be class helpers and canteen mums or dads. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Assistant Minister for Education and Training, Senator Simon Birmingham, visited Gilmore in April and helped to present certificates to Nowra Christian School students who participated in the Shoalhaven Youth Volunteering Initiative. This is a unique and very successful program where students participate in short-course, cadetship-style training in one of the local volunteer services like the State Emergency Service or the Rural Fire Service. This program has been running for many years now and is responsible for inspiring participants to join up. In fact about a third of current volunteers in our local RFS and SES began this way. At the same meeting, the minister met Daniel Palmer and James Godwin, who had just returned from a stint helping in the North Coast floodsâ€”and, yes, these two young men came through the volunteering initiative scheme. Today another group of 25 keen students from Ulladulla High School will start their training to become volunteers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in Gilmore are truly blessed by the extent of volunteerism in our region. From Red Cross to CWA to Lions and Rotary, and from Zonta to the surf-lifesaving clubs, every aspect of life has the dedicated touch of a volunteer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent weeks I have attended numerous presentations for surf-lifesaving, and I am reminded of the huge numbers of hours these amazing people give to our community. They laugh and joke about the time spent in lousy weather and duty rosters on Christmas Day and over all other weekends. They spend time training and then, in turn, train others, spending many hours to make sure our thousands of visitors are safe in the sea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Less than a month ago I attended my own Rural Fire Service brigade, the catering brigade's AGM. During the last fires we spent 10-hour shifts preparing food for the ones on the front lineâ€”but not so the captain and assistant, Donna King and Ingrid Nordermeer. They spent 15 or 16 hours making sure everything was in place for the rest of us to prepare. In a regional area that is more than 40 per cent national parks and bushland our RFS volunteers are very significant and active groups. The Bay and Basin Community Resource Centre has an inspiring network of volunteers. These people help in day care for the elderly. Their Men's Shed helps our local schools with all manner of projects, even being the father-figure in some of our single-parent families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just two weeks ago the Minister for Ageing and Disability, the Hon. Mitch Fifield, came and met another group of volunteers. He came for a number of reasons but, most importantly, the visit gave an opportunity for all our Meals on Wheels volunteers and their coordinators to speak honestly and frankly about their concerns with the new fee structure. These volunteers explained that their workâ€”for which they receive no payâ€”is more than a meal delivery; they are the social connection for many of these people who are unable to prepare for themselves, either due to age or disability or both. The issue is still in discussion, and the volunteers deserve gold stars for the phenomenal work they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The volunteers for St John Ambulance absolutely help the Gilmore region to hold the many sporting, cultural and fundraising events, such as Relay for Life, the Celtic festival and the agricultural shows. Without their presence and expertise these events simply could not happen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Gilmore we have volunteers for Landcare, Bushcare, park care, Dunecare and Rivercare, all dedicated and fantastic individuals. The volunteers for the natural world cannot be listed without mentioning Dusty Jones, the local snake man, rescuing reptiles all over the region. Such a gentleman. Then there is WIRES and NANA. Friends of the Brush-tailed Rock-wallabyâ€”who last week celebrated 20 years of protecting the marsupialâ€”launched their documentary film <span style="font-style:italic;">On the Edge</span>. Without their dedication the local Shoalhaven population would have been lost to predation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are volunteers in all regions. This weekend I appeal to those who might have a spare moment or two to go and collect for the Salvos. This weekend is their collection weekend. Everyone can be a volunteer, and I thank all Gilmore volunteers, from the bottom of my heart. By you giving your time and passion, you help us live in a better place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):  Volunteers make an enormous contribution to Australia. They are an integral part of our communities and the backbone of our nation. Volunteers deliver enormous economic and psychosocial benefits to our nation, and the truly remarkable thing is that they do this because they care about their communities and those who live in them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst delivering these services to people in communities they develop skills that they can utilise in other parts of their lives. The week of 11 to 17 May was National Volunteer Week, and the theme for National Volunteer Week this year was 'Give Happy Live Happy'. Research has shown that volunteers are happier and healthier, and sleep better. In addition, they make those they work with happier. So volunteering can be supported on many levels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was thinking about my contribution to this debate and then I started thinking about those organisations within my electorate that constantly give their time, such as Rotary and Lions. Over the last week I visited many of those organisations, not Rotary or Lions, and I had two surf-lifesaving presentations last weekend. One was at Catherine Hill Bay and one was at Redhead. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Catherine Hill Bay, which is one of the smaller clubs in the Shortland electorate, there were 4,975.75 volunteer hours given. That is valued at $99,515. At Redhead there were 4,144 patrol hours. That was valued at $82,880 worth of volunteer patrol hours. The branch has 24-hour emergency responses with 68 ambulance calls, 391 rescues, 19,165 preventive actions and over 687,450 beach attendances with volunteers working 71,500 volunteer hours. That was valued at $2.5 million for the four councils within the Hunter region. As well as the actual volunteerism and protecting people whilst they are on the beach, they make an enormous economic contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I talked about Rotary and Lions. When I was at the presentation at Redhead Surf Lifesaving Club, Charlestown Lions donated a cheque to Redhead surf club to help them buy a defibrillator. Here we have two volunteer organisations coming together to support their community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the last week, I have not been in parliament. I attended the Marine Rescue Lake Macquarie, and there were seven members that were given awards. Those seven people had 130 years of volunteering. The local Belmont Anglican Church provides support to grandparents bringing up their grandchildren, and they do that as volunteers. Yesterday I popped into an Australia's Biggest Morning Tea organised by Kylie, and there were families from out in the Belmont at the Belmont Sporties Men's Bowling Club all coming along to donate to cancer research. She did that as a volunteer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">RSL clubs, coaches for sporting teams, Meals on Wheels, aged care, schools, hospitalsâ€”the list is endless. Every organisation within our communities draws some sort of support from volunteers. In recent storms in the Hunter and Central Coast the SES and Rural Fire Service provided such vital services and helped people in their hours of need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteers make an incredible contribution to our communities. We need to recognise them, pay tribute to all the work that they do on an unpaid basis and thank them for making our society, our country what it is today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Griffith for this motion. I thought her speech was great and I agree with what she was saying. I would also like to thank the member for Gilmore and the member for Shortland for their contributions. As one of my past colleagues Queensland Senator Brett Mason once said in the other place, to volunteer is to serve. But, of course, not all those who serve are volunteers. As members of parliament we serve, but we are not volunteers. Our gallant Defence Force personnel, police officers, ambulance officers and firefighters all serve as well and are exceptional community leaders. Religious leaders also serve, but they are not always volunteers either.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To offer service through volunteering is something indeed very special. Volunteers make a commitment to a cause, person or group of people that they are not required to make. There is no obligation for people to volunteer, yet people do volunteer and do it with much passion, enthusiasm and often love. The eleventh to 17 May this year was National Volunteer Week, and around the nation we celebrated the fact that six million Australians volunteer and make Australia one of the happiest places on earth to live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The theme this year was 'Give Happy, Live Happy' to highlight the fact that volunteers not only help make other people's lives happier but are often happier as a result of their service. Throughout my time as the federal member for Petrie I have definitely met a lot of happy volunteers, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank every one of them in my electorate for the very real difference they make to our nation and our local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just the other day I was at a local citizenship ceremony and I met a young lady named Emily, and her parents, who had received Australian citizenship. I would like to quickly speak about Emily and her friends, who live in North Lakes. They are an incredible bunch of young children. Emily Sherratt goes to The Lakes College. She is ten, and her friends from North Lakes State School, Alijah and Ethan McDougall, are around the same age. Yet, between them, they have participated in more than 50 volunteering activities, many of which are ongoing. To list a few: they participate in Clean up Australia Day and encouraged others to participate; they fundraise for the Red Cross Door Knock Appeal; they collected more than $600 in toiletries and made more than 200 biscuits for the Brisbane Youth Service 'Get Schmick' campaign during Youth Week; and last year they raised more than $1,000 for Angel flight by running 14 kilometres in the City to South Fun Run, and they are planning to participate in the Bridge to Brisbane Fun Run this year. I honestly have no idea how they manage to fit this into their busy schedule of school and everything else they do. I think these young local volunteers deserve our recognition. And, of course, thank you to their parents, who tell me they are constantly driving Emily, Alijah and Ethan from one activity to the next, and they have probably baked more cookies than most of us have in our lifetimes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate is home to thousands of community organisations and thousands of volunteers and we cannot thank them enough for the time and energy they put into making our community a safe and happy one. The compassion volunteers show to the people they serve is an inspiration to us all. For that, we thank them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  On the 100th anniversary of the landing at Anzac Cove, thousands of Australians made the journey to Gallipoli. The descendants of the fallen, as well as strangers, walked among the graves, read the epitaphs and touched the walls of granite where the names of the missing are inscribed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In both world wars and in Korea, our dead lie close to where they fell. As every visitor to our war cemeteries knows, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission reverently maintains the shrines where they rest. Shortly after the commencement of our involvement in Vietnam, Australian policy changed. We decided to bring home the bodies of the fallen. We can never restore those who have died in the service of their country. But we can and we should offer solace and support to the families left behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifty years ago this week, the first contingent of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1RAR) departed for South Vietnam. Eventually, almost 60,000 Australians, including Army, Air Force and Navy personnel, served in Vietnam. Some 521 of them are listed on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial. Of the 521, all but 25 were brought home. Of the 25 not brought home, 24 of them lie at Terendak Cemetery, in Malaysia. Terendak Cemetery is situated on a peaceful slope, surrounded by trees. The graves are tended with respectâ€”and I thank the Government of Malaysia for the care it has shown over almost half a century. However, the cemetery is located within a large operational Malaysian military base, and security restrictions understandably limit the access of families to the graves of their loved ones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among those buried in Terendak Cemetery, is Private Ronald Field of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. Private Field, a forward scout, was killed in action on 9 October 1965. Also lying there is Warrant Officer Max Hanley of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam. He earned the Military Medal in the Malayan Emergency and was also awarded the US Bronze Star for exceptional heroism while serving as a platoon leader in Vietnam. Warrant Officer Hanley was killed in action in South Vietnam on 20 February 1967. Also interred at Terendak, alongside our Vietnam veterans, is Lieutenant David Brian of the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment. Lieutenant Brian was killed during operations on the Thai-Malaya border on 5 March 1964.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mrs Dianne Field, the widow of Private Ronald Field; Mrs Marie Hanley, widow of Warrant Officer Max Hanley; and Mrs Sara Ferguson, the widow of Lieutenant David Brian are with us in the gallery today. You are our honoured guests. Today we remember the sacrifice of your husbands made in the service of our countryâ€”as well as the burdens that you and your families have carried.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The natural instinct of governments is to resolve problems to the satisfaction of their citizens. We do not want soldiers killed in the same war treated differently. Hence, the government will offer to repatriate the remains of all the Australians interred at Terendak Cemetery. This offer will also be extended to the family of Warrant Officer Kevin Conway, who died in the Vietnam War and is buried in Kranji War Cemetery in Singapore. Because of the unique circumstances of Terendak Military Cemetery, with its limited access for families, this offer will be extended to all the families of those interred there, including those of service dependants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In making this decision, the government has consulted with the RSL, the Vietnam Veterans Association and the Vietnam Veterans Federation as well as with families. I want to acknowledge the fine work of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson, in this matter, and also the advocacy of the member for Solomon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision to take up this offer of repatriation rests, as it should, with the soldiers' widows, children or immediate family. They can start to bring their loved ones home or they may choose to let them rest where they lie. Either way, their decision will be respected. I can assure those who choose repatriation that we will bring our soldiers home with full military honours. They will be reburied in Australia at a cemetery of the family's choosing. The Commonwealth will bear the full cost of repatriation and reburial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former Chief of Army, Lieutenant General David Morrison, once observed that the Australians who served in Vietnam laid the foundations for the modern, professional Australian Army. They fought well in a difficult and a controversial war, but they are worthy successors to the Anzacs we remembered a month ago. Today's decision will ensure that all the Australians who died in the Vietnam War receive equal treatment. It is a policy worthy of a country that honours all who wear our uniform and who serve in our name. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do remember all who served in the Vietnam War. We especially remember those who were faithful, even unto death. They did their duty. They remain an example, and their selfless sacrifice will never be forgotten by the country they served.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00ATG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  Madam Speaker, families of our honoured servicemen, today we right a 50-year wrong. The government is offering 25 families the chance to bring home their loved ones from a far corner of a foreign field. In doing so we honour, equally and anew, all who served in Vietnam, and we remind ourselves of our solemn duty that our country owes to the loved ones of the lostâ€”a duty not just to recite the words 'Lest we forget' but to give them meaning, with lasting support and the full respect of history. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can pinpoint when Australia's involvement in Vietnam began and when it ended, but, for a generation of servicemen and their families, the end of the war is far less clear or demarcated. Not far from where we sit, on a road running up to the Australian War Memorial, a memorial is dedicated to our Vietnam forces. It bears the names of all those Australians who died in the decade-long conflict, and it is inscribed with 33 quotes designed to capture the era. There are statements from political leaders, as well as a line from John Schumann's immortal <span style="font-style:italic;">I was only 19</span>. There are the haunting words of one returned servicemen: 'I don't seem to have many friends since I came home. If you weren't there then you can't understand.' Those two sentences crystallise one of the most confronting national failuresâ€”the long years of indifference to those who served our country in Vietnam. The great, generous character of Australia deserted these men. Our empathy and our imagination ran dry. Television might have brought the Vietnam war into Australia's lounge rooms, but insufficient of us took our veterans into our hearts. TV might have given Australians a window into the world of all those who served, but millions saw without observingâ€”'If you weren't there then you can't understand.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For so many Australians, the years of debate and division over the war in Vietnam was emblematic of a broader, wider fracturing of the world they knewâ€”an up-ending of the old familiarities, and a new uncertainty to take its place. In the face of this division, Australia opted to avert its eyes and change the subject. For a generation of service people our nation's ignorance wrought their isolation. In his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Jungle Dark, </span>Steve Strevens tells the story of Frank Huntâ€”the Frankie who kicked a mine the day that mankind kicked the moon. Hunt and a group of other wounded diggers were on a day trip to the movies from the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital when they were confronted by a group of protesters. One came up to Frank in his wheelchair and rubbed a meat pie into his hair. Frank looked at the young man and said, 'You forgot the sauce.' Frank's dignity, though, cannot fully hide the shame. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As time passed, our nation worked to make amends. There was a welcome home parade in October 1987, where more than 25,000 veterans were cheered through the streets of Sydney by hundreds of thousands of Australians. For many it was the first time they had marched since their return home. At the front of the parade went the loved ones of the lostâ€”each family carrying an Australian flag in honour of the 521 fallen. Five years later in 1992, the Vietnam memorial was opened. In 2006, our parliament apologised to all those who served for the way they were treated on their return. Kim Beazley fought back tears as he read a letter from Graham Edwards, the then member for Cowan, who was badly wounded while serving in Vietnam. Kim said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Today is a day when our federal parliament should honour our Vietnam Veterans, recognise their service and say to them that they did a good job in the best tradition of the Anzacs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦Â Â Â â€¦Â Â Â â€¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Today is a day when we should say that we are proud of our Vietnam veterans, a day when we honour and recognise their sacrifice, their service and their suffering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those truths still hold firm. I do not believe that anything can ever erase the hurt and sadness that so many families experienced when they lost their loved ones early in this war. Many families fought to have the bodies returned to Australia but their pleas were rejected, and this only added to the pain. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we offer an act of healingâ€”a chance for the families of 25 Australian servicemen to bring their loved ones home at last. All of us in the parliament are privileged to have as our guests here Mrs Dianne Field, Mrs Marie Hanley, Mrs Sara Ferguson and their families; people who knew and loved the men that we honour todayâ€”people who knew and remember them not just as a name carved on a wall, or a photo on a mantelpiece, or a bundle of letters in the drawer, but as sons, brothers, husbands and fathers full of energy and purpose. When they close their eyes they can still see the face of the one they lovedâ€”a cheeky wink across the dinner table at a secret joke, a crooked smile, or perhaps just an infectious laugh. Today is for all of you and the memories that you cherish. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Francis Smith was the youngest member of his family, and he was killed by enemy sniper fire at Ben Cat on 21 September 1965. His older brother Ken wrote in an email: 'He's been away from home too long. Please bring him back to his home town for the burial in the place of his birth.' And today is for the next generation too. Kevin Conway was the first Australian to be killed in the Vietnam war. He was serving in a US special forces team and died defending their camp on the morning of 6 July 1964. Kevin's niece Cathy has just recently returned from the Kranji War Cemetery in Singapore where her uncle is buried. She told the member for Batman that she and her sister want Kevin to be brought home to rest alongside his family and friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In offering to bring home these veterans, we give the remembering descendants the chance to come in quiet and stand for a while before the grave of a relative who perhaps they never even knew, to tell a brave and lost one of a generation about a graduation, a wedding, a family reunion or a new child. In the grand sweep of tragedies of war and triumphs, today may seem a small thing. But by such moments a nation reveals itself. In this long overdue act, as with the return of our last missing from Vietnam in 2009, we show ourselves to be both a great country and a good oneâ€”good enough and decent enough to give the full respect of history to those who have earned it; good enough to do the right thing by those we once wronged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the opposition, I thank and congratulate everyone who has worked to make this happen today, particularly the Vietnam veterans of Australia, and the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia, whose passionate advocacy has done so much to change minds and drive action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are proud of our veterans. We always will be. This moment reminds us that we owe more than just pride. We must keep our promises to the families of our fallen and to all of our veterans, including the next generation of diggers as they adjust to life after Afghanistan. So let us all say our nation's promise with special emphasis today: we will remember them. Lest we forget.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak on a well-known but little-talked-about illness that affects hundreds of thousands of mostly older Australians every year. Many of us will have had the childhood virus known as chickenpox. Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. This virus is also responsible for the painful and common condition known as shingles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shingles is a painful, blistering rash that can occur on any part of the body after reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. While the bands of blisters usually occur on the torso, they can also appear on the face and eyes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once someone has had chickenpox, the virus lies dormant in the tissue near the spinal cord and brain. It spreads by travelling up and down the nerves. Shingles is a very painful condition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who has ever had chickenpox can develop shingles, and there are a number of risk factors to consider. However, the single biggest indicator of elevated risk of developing shingles is age. People over 50 years of age are far more likely to experience shingles. People living to 85 years of age have a one in two chance of experiencing shingles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And for some people the pain of shingles does not disappear with the blisters. Postherpetic neuralgia, or long-term nerve pain, is a serious, debilitating condition which can last for years as a result of damaged nerve fibres. Those who have shingles on their face or eyes are more likely to suffer this ongoing complication. According to the Mayo Clinic, if blisters are experienced on or around the eye there is a strong risk of vision impairment. Depending on the extent of the nerve damage, shingles can also cause encephalitis, facial paralysis and hearing problems. This is a condition that can and does lead to very serious after-effects that can have a major impact on the quality of life of a sufferer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no cure for shingles, so treatments include painkillers like codeine, tricyclic antidepressants, local anaesthetic and numbing agents. However, there is a vaccine available to help prevent shingles and PHN. While it may not prevent all cases of shingles from developing, it can help to reduce a case's duration and sensitivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the cost of the vaccination can be prohibitively expensive for older people. According to my local pharmacy, the cost is approximately $200 per treatment. Prior to the budget I had spoken to the health minister about the need for a shingles vaccine to be subsidised through the National Immunisation Program. After all, when we consider the value of our older Australians, through their volunteering, their work and their care for other family members, on top of what they have already contributed to our country, it seems only reasonable that we ease the costly burden of treating shingles by adding the vaccine to the program. That is why I was delighted when the Minister for Health announced, on 9 May, that Zostavax, a vaccine for the prevention of shingles and PHN, will be subsidised through the National Immunisation Program. This means that, from 1 November 2016, the vaccine will be provided free to older Australians aged 70 to 79.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the first adult vaccine to be made available in a decade. At an estimated cost to government of $100 million over four years, the new listing will help vaccinate up to 240,000 older Australians each year and 1.4 million through a five-year catch-up program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the clear benefits to the quality of life, economic modelling predicts that the vaccine has the potential to reduce the cost of shingles to the Australian healthcare system by up to $31 million over the first five years of vaccinating Australians aged 70 to 79. This includes up to 3,800 hospitalisations, 32,000 prescriptions for antivirals and 131,000 GP visits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While it is disappointing that the vaccine has not been provided sooner than November next year, I do applaud the health minister for listening and for then acting to ease the suffering of older Australians afflicted by this painful, debilitating but preventable disease. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  I thank the member for Ryan for putting forward this motion on the impact of shingles and postherpetic neuralgia, commonly known as PHN, and I am pleased to speak on the motion. Shingles is a common viral disease that affects about one in three Australians during their lifetime. As the shadow minister for ageing I have met many people who have talked to me about issues such as this. Everyone who develops shingles will have experienced an episode of chickenpox, often some decades earlier, perhaps in childhood. If you have not had shingles, it is likely that you will have a family member or friend who has had it. Symptoms include localised pain, described as burning, numbness or tingling; a sensitivity to touch; the emergence of a red rash a few days after the pain commences; fluid-filled blisters that break open and crust over; and itching. So you can imagine the challenge for older Australians, particularly those who are not as mobile as they once were.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a particular challenge for those in residential aged-care facilities and for those carers who are looking after older Australians with these problems at home. The rash can appear on a person's face or neck but classically takes the shape of a belt or a band.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A 2014 survey, conducted by National Seniors, found that of those respondents who had shingles, 51 per cent said that it affected their social activities, 45 per cent said it affected their daily household chores and 32 per cent said it affected their work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">PHN is a persistent chronic pain syndrome. Shingles is certainly unpleasant but PHN can be an absolute misery for those people who are suffering from it. The National Centre for Immunisation, Research and Surveillance reports that 150,000 new cases of shingles appear in Australia each year and 70 per cent of those are of patients over 50 years of age. Beyond the age of 70, the rate of shingles is about 14 per cent for every 1,000 of population. About half of those people who live to age 85 will develop the disease. About 15 per cent of patients with shingles over 50 years of age will develop PHN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">About 80 to 85 per cent of PHN sufferers are over 80 years of age. While there is yet no cure for shingles or PHN I commend the government for their decision on the recent vaccine Zostavax. It has been developed to reduce incidences of both these diseases. Encouragingly, the study that was done by the NCIRS reported that the vaccine Zostavax was found to reduce the functional impact of shingles by 59 per cent on those people over 80 years of age who developed the disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of politics note that the government have listed this vaccine on the National Immunisation Program in the 2015 budget. We thank them for that. It will be subsidised for those Australians aged from 70 to 79. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While this news is welcome for many Australians, I do note the last part of the member for Ryan's motion:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ acknowledges that preventative health measures such as vaccination will help protect the health of older Australians and safeguard their ability to work, care and volunteer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">About six million Australians volunteer. It is estimated that this contributes about $15 billion to the national economy every year. So it is an absolute shame that, across two budgets, the government have cut funding for preventative health programs. We note that, after cutting about $57 billion in their first budget and through their subsequent decisions, they have cut another $2 billion in their latest budget. If you look at page 110 of Budget Paper No. 2, there is a cut of almost a billion dollars to an undisclosed number of health programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another of my roles is that of shadow minister for Indigenous affairs. This government has cut $534 million in funding across the forward estimatesâ€”including nearly $146 million this yearâ€”from Indigenous programs. That includes cuts of $165 million to funding for Indigenous health, in particular funding for community controlled health clinics that make a big contribution not only to Indigenous employment but to health, wellness and welfare. I urge the government to reconsider those cuts. While they have made a good decision in relation to vaccination, I urge them to look at the cuts they have made in the last two budgets to preventative health programsâ€”and to reverse those decisions. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr STONE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  I am so pleased that the Abbott government will invest $1.3 billion in listing new medicines and vaccines that are going to save lives and help thousands of Australians manage debilitating conditions like shinglesâ€”and the aftermath of shingles, which can include the most debilitating and painful of conditions. I commend the member for Ryan for this motion. I think it is very important that we recognise that shingles and postherpetic neuralgia can cause terrible, debilitating pain for hundreds of thousands of Australians. We are now going to make prevention of shingles possible through vaccination. This is the most effective way to reduce the number of Australians suffering either from shingles or from what we call PHNâ€”one of the neuralgic conditions that can affect older people in particular. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can get the vaccine now, but it costs over $200. A lot of older Australians simply cannot afford a vaccine that costs $200â€”in addition, perhaps, to the cost of going to the medical practitioner. This measure will enable older Australians, those over 70, to access this vaccine. It is a shame that it is going to take a fair whileâ€”I understand it will perhaps be over a yearâ€”to have the vaccine available for the National Immunisation Program. But we are told by the Department of Health that they need to procure the vaccine, develop a communications strategy, plan safety surveillance and undertake negotiations with the states and territories. That is unfortunate. It is a problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that one of the issues with shingles is that you should get attention urgently, as soon as you recognise the symptomsâ€”the rash, the pain or the itching. If you do not get assistance very quickly, within the first 24 hours, the shingles condition can become much worse and much more prolonged. It can potentially lead to the terrible consequences of the PHN condition. For elderly people, who often are not able to get to a doctor quickly or who might not be aware of the symptoms, this vaccine will be critical. It means the elderly will not have to have someone who communicates with them rushing them to a doctor; they will have been vaccinated against this condition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am particularly aware of how serious this condition can be, because one of my father's dearest friendsâ€”who was the only other survivor of his Bomber Command crew shot down over Germanyâ€”contracted shingles when he was in his nineties and then, unfortunately, developed the most terrible complication of shingles: persistent, chronic neuropathic pain, known as postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN. This affected his face in particular. While he had had other health issues, including renal issues and of course the consequences of his horrific experience during the Second World War, he said to my father that he could bear all of that but that what he found almost impossible to bear was the pain of the herpetic neuralgia on his face. It made his life unbearable. I think if he had been able to access that vaccine, which we will now have available to 71- to 79-year-olds, he might have lived his last few years without that incredible pain. The condition affected his face and his eyes in particular, so he felt less able to go out and socialise with other people. This vaccine would have been an enormous advantage to a man like him, and of course there are so many other older sufferers of this condition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the whole business of shingles relates to getting chicken pox in your younger years; it has to have been in your system. In Australia you can be immunised against chicken pox, so I strongly recommend that all Australian parents also look at the good effect of having your children immunised against the very common childhood disease of chicken pox. The disease of chicken pox leads to the virus; it can be activated as shingles in later life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, there are a lot of things we can do about this condition, and I am so pleased to be part of a government that recognised this and that the shingles vaccine Zostavax will now be on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I am pleased that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee recommended back in November 2014 that it be put on this scheme. We can and will do something about this. We know where our priorities lie. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  I congratulate the member for Ryan for bringing this important motion on shingles and postherpetic neuralgia to the House. Parliamentary Friends of Seniors, which is co-chaired by the member of Swan, Steve Irons, and me, has hosted two events around this. It became very obvious to us that the one thing that was needed was for this vaccine to be listed. Everyone who has had chicken pox is at risk of developing shingles. Older Australians bear the brunt of this disease, and by 85 years of age one in two Australians will have had shingles. So, it is one in three for all Australians, and one in two once you reach the age of 85.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shingles pain can really impact quality of life to a degree comparable to a heart attack, type 2 diabetes and depression. And shingles, as has been mentioned by previous speakers, is accompanied by postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN, which causes the significant and debilitating pain that has been talked about in this House todayâ€”pain that can affect all parts of the body and pain that can also impact the optic nerve, which is one of the worst forms of shingles. There are 150,000 cases of shingles in Australia each year. Among Australians aged 60 and over it accounts for 3,609 hospitalisations, costing $16.7 million each year, and 105,000 GP consultations, costing $3.3 million a year. So, any effort to reduce these hospitalisations, any effort to reduce the pain, is well and truly welcome by those of us on this side of the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been a number of studies that support the vaccine. Since 2005 there have been several large studies. One study involving 38,546 patients aged 60 and over showed an overall 50 per cent reduction in shingles. Another study, of 75,760 people who received the vaccine, found a 55 per cent reduction in shingles. The most recent study, conducted in the US and involving 766,330 randomly chosen people, showed a reduction of 59 per cent in the PHN and 48 per cent in shingles. It is a very debilitating illness. It is an illness that has its greatest impact on people who are older, and it starts with a rash. Antiviral therapy can reduce the severity and duration of shingles but does not prevent the PHN. To actually get an impact you must get that antiviral treatment within the first 24 hours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, this vaccine will make a difference in the lives of tens of thousands of Australiansâ€”our older Australians, who are particularly adversely affected by shingles. I really welcome the listing of the vaccine, but I am very disappointed that it will not be listed on the PBS until 1 November 2016. That is after the election. It is a long time from now, and in that period of time there will be another 150,000 people who suffer from shingles in the next year, and if you halve that and add another 75,000 onto it, it is a significant number of people who are going to be debilitated by shingles. I call on the government to reconsider bringing that date forward, and I congratulate the member for Ryan on her fantastic motion. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0H" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAMING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to talk about this very, very important topic. Particularly for older Australians over the age of 50, the herpes zoster virus is a significant cause of morbidity. All of us will have had personal experience with chickenpox in children. The herpes zoster virus is simply a manifestation of that disease later in life. It has significant chronic impacts. I am very familiar with those impacts having been an eye surgeon treating herpes zoster ophthalmicus, which is an occurrence from this infection that occurs in about 20 per cent of cases, mostly in older Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vaccines that are effective in the herpes family have been a long time coming. The herpes zoster virus is probably the most significant cause of morbidity in older Australians in that family of over five different herpes varieties. The herpes zoster virus is responsible for significant pain and suffering for older Australians. Understanding the economics of the benefits of a vaccine requires that we look at the age of the person, because not only is age going to affect the incidence and the severity of the condition but also the vaccine itself is less effective as one becomes older. The economics of life expectancy at every age point in time start to also mean that you have different cost benefits from the vaccination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Evidence also is not complete for use of this vaccine in younger patients. It is registered for use by those over the age of 50. There was a very important budget announcement that made it available to 70-year-olds, which I commend, and in addition to that there is a catch-up program for those who were recently 70 years of age. If you are between 70 and 80 now you can be reasonably confident that over the catch-up period you will have access to this vaccine. Of course, there is nothing to stop you going out and getting that on the free market, but it is now added to the national immunisation program. It is an important benefit. We are always going to be looking as well at those under the age of 70. There is quite a lot of evidence around those aged 60 to 70. The vaccine's efficacy becomes weaker in those aged 50 to 60.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are talking about is familiar to everyone. Most of us can recall having chickenpox in our youth. We cannot always be sure it was, in fact, chickenpox, but that really does not matter. In our lifetime we will see about a quarter of Australians having an episode of the herpes zoster virus, making immunisation something worth considering. Those painful vesicular rashes are very much restricted to what we call the dermatomes, the areas of the body that are covered by a nerveâ€”in this case, a cranial nerve. They demarcate the area where you can get those rashes. Rashes very much conform to those dermatomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The small percentage chance that you will have more than just the pain of the immediate episode is the great concern. It is not the immediate infection that is necessarily the problem; it is a whole series of what we call sequelae that can follow with time. When there is pain in the affected area lasting more than 120 days after the initial infection, we consider that to be postherpetic neuralgia. That kind of a pain, which can exist for years, is worse in those who are older. It can be associated also with a range of other outcomes. There is local scarring and pigmentation of the skin where the rash has occurred. There is the ocular involvement that can lead to severe ocular problems, which I will talk about in a second. There is even the possibility of meningitis and other systemic infections where large parts of the body are affected. These neurological problems are extremely rare and they are most commonly seen either in people who are living asymptomatically with HIV, for instance, or in someone who has had some other type of treatment that might affect their immune status. In those cases, on a case-by-case basis, you would want to consider the benefits of vaccination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now we have the program that is approved for those who are 70 and above. But I commend the member for Ryan for raising this bigger picture, which is that this is a relatively affordable vaccine. Through more and more detailed cost-effectiveness analysis, I hope it will be considered in the future for younger populations. Anyone who has seen a patient living with postherpetic neuralgia would know that its treatment is limited to only a very few versions of analgesia to reduce pain. This pain can go on for years. It is something that a vaccination can make a complete difference to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember that it is not a complete cover. We are talking about reducing the incidence of the disease by around 50 per cent. We would be trying to reduce the severity and duration of that postherpetic neuralgia with a vaccine. We see reductions of about two-thirds in those over the age of 70 and slightly less than that for those under. It is well worth considering. We will see further cost-effectiveness analysis leading to further approvals, I am sure.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  I, too, would like to commend the member for Ryan for bringing this matter before the House. It is a very important issue, particularly when you consider the consequences for an ageing population. Shingles, as others have referred to, is a virus based on the chickenpox virus. At the moment, as I understand it, it impacts on about 150,000 Australians each year, principally older Australians aged above 60. In terms of those Australians aged above 85, it affects almost one in two. So it is something that is very much an issue to be considered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of those Australians affected was my father. He died a couple of years back. He died from the consequences of cancer. He also had very advancing dementia, but if he were alive today I am sure he would say that, of all the suffering he experienced, nothing came close to the suffering he experienced from shingles. The shingles he acquired manifested in his eye socket. He would almost go mad from the symptoms. Dad was a former police officer. I grew up never knowing him to have sick day. He was a very strong and very determined man and one who would rarely cast a shadow over the door of a doctor's surgery. So when he acquired shingles he decided he would ride it out. As most people would be aware, to treat shingles effectively you must treat it in the first 24 hours. So unfortunately for dad in his last six years of life, apart from the radiation for his cancer, it was very much shingles that really debilitated his quality of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To think that we now have a vaccine for shingles being brought forward is great. I wish it could be done earlier. I know that it is not planned to be brought onto the PBS until November next year, but for an ageing population, as we have here in this country, this is something that will change the lives of many people. That is something that has to be considered, as we look at the holistic aspects of medication that is being funded. A vaccine of this nature will change the lives of many. It will take away a lot of suffering, and if it can help ease the lives of people who will suffer as greatly as my father did, then that is a great contribution that this parliament could make to our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The virus, as has been indicated, really becomes manifest for those who have suffered chickenpox. I know that in the past one of the things about chickenpoxâ€”and this happened when I was growing upâ€”was that you would make sure your child came in contact with kids with chickenpox, because in that generation it was thought that once you had it, you did not get it again. That is the way I suppose a generation of us were brought up, but the consequence of that is that once that virus is there, it remains in the body, in the spinal cord. For older Australians, as I said, it becomes less dormant, particularly for those aged above 60, and it mutates into shingles and delivers the effects of PHN in the body. This is something that, as I said earlier, is very debilitating. And the consequence of it is that it affects vast numbers of older Australians. Therefore, I am very happy to speak on the member for Ryan's motion. I am very please that she has brought this forward. It is something I have not really reflected upon for some time, not since my father's passing, but if this could make a difference in people's lives and reduce the degree of suffering that I had to witness, it would be a great thing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the motion moved by my hard-working colleague the member for Ryan. But I would also like to mention and to congratulate the member for Lyne, Dr David Gillespie, who has also been out briefing his colleagues about just how devastating the effects of shingles can be, and how important it is to have this vaccine on the list. As a child of the seventies, I suffered chickenpox and I clearly remember asking my mother if I could have a bath in calamine lotion, which happened to be the treatment at the time. You would be covered in all of this pink substance, which hopefully made it all a little bit better. Unfortunately, the chickenpox also manifested as shingles in my early 20s, so I have some personal experience of this. It is a terrible disease, absolutely terrible, and there have been good contributions from both sides of the House on this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shingles, or herpes zoster, presents as a painful rash on one side of the body that can lead to long-term nerve pain as well as hearing loss and damage to eyesight, as we have heard from many other speakers. Some 21,700 people over the age of 70 call the Hinkler electorate home. The reason this is relevant to this topic today is because senior Australians are particularly susceptible to the shingles virus. One in two Australiansâ€”one in twoâ€”will experience an episode of shingles by the age of 85. The frequency and severity of complications associated with shingles increases with age, and up to 50 per cent of patients over 50 years of age with shingles may develop a debilitating neuropathic pain that can persist for years, as we have heard in the contributions this morning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senior Hinkler residents make a significant contribution to the local economy and the community. Not only do they care for their grandchildren so that their adult children can work but they also make up the overwhelming bulk of volunteers in my electorate. For those who currently still work or want to be working at the age of 70 illness, injury and disability can be major barriers to employment participation. Pain is the most debilitating symptom of shingles. Sixty per cent of patients who were working when they acquired shingles reported an absence from work. More than 50 per cent of patients had to limit walking, and were unable to sleep properly. One-third of patients had difficulty with simple activities such as bathing and getting dressed. Shingles sufferers' risk of stroke increased 63 per cent in the four weeks after shingles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no cure, only prevention. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has recommended listing the shingles vaccine on the National Immunisation Program. It was estimated the vaccine could prevent up to 47,000 cases of shingles and up to 14,000 cases of postherpetic neuralgia in the first five years following the commencement of the vaccination program. The makers of the vaccine estimate it will reduce the cost of shingles on the Australian healthcare system by about 31 million in five years, including 30,000 fewer prescriptions for antivirals, 130,000 fewer visits to GPs and almost 4,000 fewer hospitalisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the 2015-16 federal budget released earlier this month, the coalition announced $1.3 billion for new life-saving drug listings, including the shingles vaccine. Zostavax will be subsidised through the National Immunisation Program to prevent shingles in people aged between 70 and 79 years of age. It is estimated the new listing will cost more than $100 million over four years. This new listing will help vaccinate up to 240,000 older Australians on an ongoing basis each year, and 1.4 million individuals through a five-year catch-up program. Without government subsidy, this vaccine would cost consumers more than $200 per dose of vaccine. There are more than 14,000 Hinkler residents aged between 70 and 79â€”14,000â€”who will benefit from this listing. Of course they live in my electorate because they can take advantage of a wonderful climate and a fantastic place to live and all of the other advantages you have of being in Queensland of course.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to office, the coalition has doubled the number of drug listings for consumers. That is an investment of almost $3 billion for 652 new and amended drug listings in just over 18 months. In order to continue listing new drugs quickly for patients, government had to find a sustainable way to fund them. With total investment in the PBS currently $10 billion and growing as more and more new drugs come onto the market, taxpayers will invest at least $50 billion in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in the next five years. We have already got another $3 billion worth of new, innovative medicines in the pipeline for future listing and will need to find sustainable ways to fund them. The sensible place is to look at the price taxpayers and patients pay for existing medicines to ensure we have the capacity to fund new ones, and I welcome the health minister's comments that she will hold constructive discussions with the entire pharmaceutical supply chain about the best ways to make the PBS sustainable for future generations. I look forward to her announcing the full package of proposed measures in due course. I commend this motion to the House. It will be a fantastic outcome for the people of my electorate.</span>

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The death penalty says that society is no better than the brutal response of 'an eye for an eye'. It says there is no such thing as redemption or rehabilitation. It says that our justice systems are infallible. All these statements are wrongâ€”and so the death penalty is wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The focus in Australia on the recent executions in Indonesia was an opportunity to remember that the fundamental inhumanity of putting a person to death continues to be overlooked by the governments of several countries with which we have close and important relations. The United States, for example, last year was fifth on the list of nations carrying out executions; the other countries in the top five were China, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. I agree with the community sentimentâ€”and with the government's approach to this issueâ€”that says our bilateral relationship with any country will be affected by their practice of the death penalty, even when they are our friends, as Indonesia is and as are China and the United States. I commend the campaign launched last week by eight human rights organisations in Australia, including Amnesty International, called 'Australian government and the death penalty: a way forward'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I note that all those executed in Indonesia were put to death for drug offencesâ€”and it is past time that we had a wide-ranging discussion in Australia about the way in which the criminalisation of drug use and addiction in fact creates the worst criminal aspects of drug trafficking. If drug addiction was treated as a health issue rather than as criminal behaviour, would we still have the profiteering, drug-pushing, violence and property crime; would we still have prisons full of people who are often sick and disadvantaged, and who through prison are often further alienated from the possibility of education and employment and further entrenched in a cycle of need, powerlessness and self-destruction? Human society, at its best, is capable of the most amazing good things. As individuals we run the full spectrum from saints to monsters and everything in between, but together we can identify and hold on to our best collective values, enshrine them in our laws, enable them to permeate throughout our culture as we make progress towards our better nature. In this vein I would like to conclude with some words written by Sarah Gill from UWA, published on Crikey:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the final terrible weeks of Chan and Sukumaran [remind] us that freedomâ€”and courageâ€”comes in many different forms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Incarcerated on the prison island of Nusakambangan, increasingly cut off from family, friends and the world at large, denied the freedom to speak, to argue their case, and denied, at the end, their very lives, the pair distilled their choices down to this: to love, to paint, to hope, to be generous, to embrace, to stand tall, to sing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As for the rest of us, we'll probably continue to take our freedoms for granted. But while we might not agree on how to value a person's worth, we can be infinitely grateful we're free to decide, for ourselves, those we admire. For me, I'll be remembering the words of Nelson Mandelaâ€”'a saint is a sinner who keeps on trying'â€”and thinking of two Sydney boys who chose, under the worst of circumstances, to be the best of what remained to them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  I second the motion, I thank the member for Fremantle for proposing it and I welcome the opportunity to speak to it as the seconder. This parliament is at its best when there are matters such as those raised in this motion which we can all support. I thank the member for her interest and her campaigning on this issueâ€”I do so in the context of her motion of condolence in relation to Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. I add my condolences, personally, to their families. They live in the north-west of Sydney and are known to many people in my community. The fact that these were young men who committed a grievous criminal act can never justify their execution. It was an execution that proceeded notwithstanding the recognition, as I understand it, in Indonesia that if people are reformed there should be consequences of that, and that should have been taken into account in considering remission. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, these tragic events bring a time for renewalâ€”renewal of our campaign to rid the earth of this heinous penalty by states. There has been significant change over a period of timeâ€”140 countries have now abolished the death penalty either in law or in practice. That is a significant change from 1977, when only 16 countries had done so. I am appalled that in a highly important state to us all, the United States, they continue to execute. I understand that the other countries that significantly execute large numbers of people include Iran, China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. If we can get change in the United States, we may well be able to get change elsewhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Fremantle in her observations referred to the recent statement by organisations such as Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, the Human Rights Law Centre, Reprieve, Australians Detained Abroad, Civil Liberties Australia, UnitingJustice and the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties. In their recommendations, there are suggestions as to the way in which government here in Australia can take a very much more proactive roleâ€”and I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs had an opportunity to examine the suggestions, which are very full and complete, about the way in which we can replicate arrangements in the United Kingdom for taking a diplomatic lead on this issue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, I welcome the fact that an increasing number of members of parliament are joining our group, Australian Parliamentarians against the Death Penalty. I thank them for doing so, but it is also a time for all members to remember that they can play a role. Many of us have the opportunity to travel abroad from time to time, to meet with other parliaments, to meet in parliamentary delegations, to meet delegations that are travelling here. I will use one example. I met with the Prime Minister of Vietnam when he came here to Australia and I raised the issue of the death penalty. While I cannot claim I was personally responsible, I am pleased that every time the matter seems to be raised they do at least reduce the number of offences for which they can execute people. I think there is a very, very important role that colleagues can play and I hope they will participate in our group, join it and actively take these matters up with other governments when they have the opportunity to do so.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  I thank the member for Fremantle for bringing this motion forward. I am very happy to follow my friend the member for Berowra, the Father of the House and my co-convener of Australian Parliamentarians against the Death Penalty. By the way, next Friday will mark exactly one month since two Australian citizens, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, along with six of their fellow prisoners in Indonesia, were executed. This was a tragic conclusion to 10 long years of pleas for mercy, not only from the men themselves but from their families, from the leadership of this country and from many Australian citizensâ€”10 years during which these men demonstrated their rehabilitation and showed their genuine remorse and, quite frankly, a period which reminded everybody that the death penalty really has no place in the modern world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 29 April, all of our worst fears came to fruition with these executions. It was a moment some of us felt deflated, not only at the executions but at the pointlessness of our fight and that our pleas had not been heard. But I have to say, for the member for Berowra, the member for Fremantle and others, these feelings of being defeated did not last all that long. We became very much reinvigorated for the purpose and determined to fight to see an end to the death penalty in all our sphere of influence, not just in cases that involve Australians but in all cases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The death penalty is simply wrong. I have fought against the death penalty throughout my political career. Coincidentally, I entered parliament in 2005, when the case of the Bali Nine began. I have been involved since its beginning. As a matter of fact, I met with Myuran Sukumaran, Andrew Chan, Scott Rush and their families when they were in Kerobokan Prison. I personally witnessed their successful rehabilitation in that prison. If anything, that should have been seen as an example of the success of Indonesia's correction system, proof that people can turn their lives around and make a positive contribution to society, even after going down such a dark path as they did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, together with my wife, I attended the funerals of Andrew and Myuran. They were held a day apart in Sydney. It was clear that their families, innocent of any crime, have been caused deep and abiding suffering by this extreme punishment. They have lived 10 years knowing that their sons, brothers or friends were on death row, 10 years of being haunted by the daily prospect of uncertainty. As a parent, as many in this place are, I know that, regardless of what our children do, nothing ever extinguishes or diminishes the love and the care that we have for them. This is probably the reason why more than 140 countries, including many in our regionâ€”and Indonesia's region, for that matterâ€”have already abolished this most cruel and irreversible form of punishment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The death penalty is an abuse of the most fundamental human right of allâ€”that is, the right to life itself. Indonesia itself has long advocated on behalf of its own citizens held in foreign countries and as a matter of fact has been successful in sparing the lives of 210 Indonesian citizens. The hypocrisy is that Indonesia, to this day, continues to advocate for the lives of its own citizens while declining Australia's request for clemency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and time again we learn from experts that capital punishment is not a deterrent for serious crime in today's society. No legal system is completely free from error and it is tragic to think that an unintentional error could be made that would cost somebody's life. I conclude with the words of the former Chief Justice of the South African Constitutional Court, Ismail Mahomed:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The death penalty sanctions the deliberate annihilation of life â€¦ It is the ultimate and the most incomparably extreme form of punishment â€¦ It is the last, the most devastating and the most irreversible recourse of the criminal law, involving as it necessarily does, the planned and calculated termination of life itself; the destruction of the greatest and most precious gift which is bestowed on all humankind â€¦</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:43</span>):  I rise to speak to the motion. I thank the member for Fowler, the member for Fremantle for putting the motion on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>, and also previous speakersâ€”the member for Berowra and othersâ€”who have spoken to this motion. On 12 February this year, this parliament stood united in speaking to the joint motion from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the member for Sydney against the grave injustice that was looming at that time, with the pending executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. In many ways it is tragic that it takes a true tragedy to unite us, but in speaking out against the death penalty, wherever it is still followed anywhere in the world, then united as parliamentarians we must be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tragically, Andrew and Myuran, along with six others prisoners, were executed on 29 April. The simple but chilling empty questions that we are all left with are these. How do the deaths of these men help anybody?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What message do their deaths send to anyone seeking redemption and wanting to make amends for wrongdoing? How can their deaths be justified under the notion that the death penalty provides a deterrent against such crimes, thereby protecting life through an act of violence in taking lives? And how do we provide comfort and solace to their families where there is none to be had in the face of such loss? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 2 March this year, I spoke in the Federation Chamber on the plight of Andrew and Myuran and my belief that punishment by death is not the path to a better outcome in Indonesia, or for that matter anywhere in the world. There is no statistical evidence that deterrence through death works, in the same way that there is no meaningful evidence of whether the death penalty deters more than life imprisonment does. But, in considering the justification of deterrence, I again invite everyone to consider the contradiction that taking a life will actually save others. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government implemented a sustained, high-level advocacy campaign to try to stay Andrew and Myuran's executions. Eleven written representations were sent to Indonesian counterparts from 7 Januaryâ€”from the Prime Minister, the Governor-General, the Attorney-General, the Minister for Justice and Minister Bishop. Both the Prime Minister and Minister Bishop wrote joint letters with our colleagues from the opposition and the Greens. More than 100 parliamentarians conveyed their position in a joint letter to the Indonesian ambassador, and I thank the member for Fremantle for organising that. In those representations, we reiterated our respect for Indonesia's sovereignty, while pointing out the special circumstances that warranted mercy. Indonesia was in no doubt about our position. In addition, the member for Berowra and the member for Fowler are co-convenors of the Australian Parliamentarians Against the Death Penalty group, which now has over 60 members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, there is strength in unity, and as parliamentarians we have come together to speak to the world to say that, wherever possible, we will not tolerate the death penalty. As parliamentarians of this great Parliament of Australia, we must remain united and we must condemn the death penalty, whatever country it still occurs in.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I take the opportunity to rise today to support the sentiments that have been expressed so far by my colleagues but also to add my voice to the growing global movement against the death penalty. I want to begin by thanking the member for Fremantle for bringing this motion to the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I express my condolences to the families and loved ones of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, the two Australians executed in Indonesia by firing squad on 29 April 2015. I also extend my sympathies to the families of the six other prisoners who were similarly executed alongside Andrew and Myuran.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The eight executed human beings did not deserve to die in this manner. As I said previously in this place some 10 years ago, when Australian Vang Nguyen was executed in Singapore, no-one has the right to take the life of another human being under any circumstances and in particular by state-sanctioned execution. In the wake of this tragedy and with regard to the continued practice of state-sanctioned killings in a number of countries, Australian parliamentarians have an opportunity to be an example of a strong bipartisan commitment supporting the global abolishment of the death penalty. In this vein, I would like to congratulate the member for Berowra and the member for Fowler, who co-convene the Australian Parliamentarians against the Death Penalty group. I have joined this group and I am very much committed to its aims and objectives. Our aim is to raise the issue of the death penalty in the media and in bilateral meetings, as well as parliament to parliament; to express opposition to the death penalty in meetings with ambassadors, elected officials and foreign dignitaries; and to converse with advisory groups and legal experts about approaches to end state-sanctioned killing worldwide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> In line with joining the parliamentary group, I take this opportunity today to express my strong opposition to the death penalty and to suggest some proposals Australia should adopt to see an end to the barbaric practice. One frequently mentioned argument against the death penalty is the lack of evidence supporting the claim that it effectively deters crime as opposed to other punishments. Professor Jeffrey Fagan, Professor of Law at Columbia University in the United States, who previously appeared as an expert witness for Andrew and Myuran, maintains that there is 'no credible scientific evidence that the death penalty deters criminal behaviour'. He argues that 'even when executions are frequent and well-publicised', as was the case with Andrew and Myuran's executions, 'there are no observable changes in crimes.' The absence of any scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of the death penalty compounds the more fundamental moral argument that state-sanctioned killing diminishes the value of human life. Simply put, it is never justified for the state to take human life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been growing global support for this perspective, and it appears that we are on the right path. Whilst 100 countries around the world have the death penalty, only 21 continue to use capital punishment. And of those countries that continue to carry out executions, using the death penalty as a punishment for crime has decreased by more than a third in the last decade. There has been growing global support for this perspective, and it clearly appears that the debate today is in line with that support. Whilst 100 countries around the world have the death penalty, only 21 continue to use capital punishment. Of those countries that continue to carry out executions, using the death penalty as a punishment for crime has decreased by more than a third in the last decade, and that is indeed a welcome sign of perhaps heading towards the beginning of the abolition of the death penalty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the decline in use of the death penalty worldwide and the current global push to abolish the practice, it is time that parliamentarians around the world demand a moratorium on capital punishment. Parliamentarians for Global Action, a non-profit, nonpartisan international network of parliamentarians, established a global parliamentary platform for the abolition of the death penalty. Their aim is to support the individual initiatives of parliamentarians worldwide and to launch and coordinate targeted actions in selected countries, as well as bring awareness to the issue. As a parliament, I think that we ought to support the efforts of the PGA and that we should use every opportunity we have, certainly in our parliamentary duties, to raise awareness, especially with colleagues in our regional neighbourhood, because I think that is the best way to begin this dialogue and to pursue the abolition of capital punishment. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="241586" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs SUDMALIS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  Many of us in this House have received emails asking for our opinion about this issue and asking how we feel about this issueâ€”including emails from parents who have been affected by people dealing drugs. There are two sides to this argument. I hear both sides clearly, and I know that it means a great deal to these people. But at no time should the death penalty ever be on the table for any person. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular case brought the passions of the Australian people to the fore in the media, and for all people from all sides of government. These two men did change their lives and they did express remorse for what they did. There has to be something in the system that says, 'If you change, and if you accept that you did the wrong thing, there is some chance of forgiveness to some extent'. They could have stayed in jail for that period of time and continued to do the work that they were doing, and that would perhaps have been a better outcome. I think most people in Australia would have accepted that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that they lost their lives has made a big impact on people here. We do know that when you go to a nation you have follow the laws of the land, and any visitor to that nation knows that, if you traffic in drugs, the consequences are pretty serious. By the same token, it is not the best outcome to just say that you will lose your life. To have this going on for 10 years was extraordinarily difficult for all members of their families and their friends. It sort of said: 'Yes, maybe you will be forgiven. And maybe you will not.' The way it was brought to the public's attention was pretty devastating for everyone involved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is pretty special to see both sides of the House being quite undivided on this. There are not that many occasions when this House works collegiately together, and this is certainly an issue that has brought us together on a very special issue. I think it is an issue that we should all look at in greater depth. It horrifies me that there are nations in the world where one of the consequences of being convicted of a crime is still beheading. It is of concern that life is held so cheaply when there is a chance a person will change the way they live and they way they look at life. So, yes, we know there are consequences, but this is not one of the best consequences that should happen. Our thoughts go to the families. Our thoughts also remain with the families of those who deal in drugs, because drugs are a scourge on our society. I am completely convinced that those who have anything to do with hard drugs are affecting our community very badly, and I think there should be considerable consequences. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ice is something that there should be a heavy penalty forâ€”not the death penalty, but that is in fact what happens to some of the people who take it. I am very concerned about that. We have to have consequences; people should know they are doing the wrong thing. My community is up in arms about ice. We have a number of very difficult circumstances. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have lots of people in my community who wrote to me on this issue, from both sides of the spectrum. One was: 'For heaven's sakes, they should have got it over and done with years ago'. Others said, 'This should never have happened. This should never have been an outcome.' And others said, 'Drugs are a desperate and dangerous substance and we need to look very carefully at the way they interact with our people'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can only say that the death penalty is not the right avenue. We need to be more educative, more careful with our people. We need to make sure that our young people are well aware of what the consequences are when they travel or when they dabble in these substances. Thank you. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83S" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:56</span>):  I would like to thank all those who spokeâ€”and most particularly the member for Gilmore, who has spoken so elegantly, without any notes. I would like to commend her for taking up the challenge to talk on this difficult subject that others seem to have been shying away from, which I think is a bit of a tragedy. I know we are all very busy in this place but I think this is one of the issues where we should be united as a voice against this terrible scourge of the death penalty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The deaths of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, along with six other prisoners, are a tragedy. They are a tragedy for these young men, whose lives have ben cut so short. They are a tragedy for the families that they leave behind, families who will never get over this situation. But they are also a tragedy for justice. There is no justice in the death penalty. It is always an unjust response. This is not a debate about guilt or innocence. By their own submission, Andrew and Myuran were pretty stupid and thoughtless 21- and 23-year-olds when they committed an awful crime; a crime, as the member for Gilmore rightly points out, that is causing devastating harm in our community. And it would have caused untold damage to many other young Australiansâ€”not to members of the Indonesian communityâ€”and we do not shy away from the debate about the scourge of drugs. But they did not seek pardons for their actions. Members of this House, the Australian government and the Australian Labor Party did not seek pardon for their crimes; only clemency from the death penaltyâ€”a punishment that has now been carried out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That punishment will have no impact on the problem of drug trafficking in Indonesia or indeed in Australia. Eleven years ago, I was actively pleading for the life of Van Tuong Nguyenâ€”another naive, stupid young man who committed a terrible crime and paid the ultimate price; his life over at 25. Did his execution stop drug trafficking through Singapore? Did it catch the dealer using Van as a mule? Did it lead to actions taken against the drug syndicate who supplied the drugs to the Bali Nine? Has it stopped people taking drugs? The answer to all these questions is of course: no. Has the death penalty in any way changed people's behaviour? No, it has not. Have they learnt? Sadly, they have not. Have we changed? No, we have not. And more mothers have lost their sons. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I keep in constant contact with Kim Nguyen, who is a constituent of mine. This tragedy again has brought home to her the thoughtless act of the crime of killing her son. At the end of the day, that is what the death penalty is. Did it bring justice? Has it ensured we are tough on crime? Has 'tough on crime' become just a populist, political headline-grabbing thing? Isn't it something we should actually be dealing with? Shouldn't we be looking to the issues that will reduce the hideous taking of drugs in our community? Because the death penalty has not. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reducing crime requires governments and justice systems to be tough on the causes of crime. To borrow the words of former Victorian Attorney-General Rob Hulls: 'The justice system is at its best when it functions as a positive intervention on the life of an offender; when it seeks to rehabilitate, prevent recidivism and help offenders become productive members of society.' Andrew and Myuran were examples of how Indonesia's justice system can be that positive intervention. They accepted their punishment, undertook to reform themselves and sought to reform others. That is actually the outcome that all justice systems should seek. Tragically, their executions undo that positive action and have not led to any criminal action being taken against the individuals who were supplying the drugs. Let us get to the heart of the problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is not just Indonesia where these tragedies occur; 16 countries around the world still use the death penalty, ineffective though it is. In the United States, seven states still use the death penalty. While it is a welcome fact that death sentences in 2014 were at the lowest rate since 1976, we must continue to urge all American governments to discontinue the use of the death penalty. According to Amnesty International, the murder rate in all non-death penalty states is lower than in the states where they have it. The threat of execution is unlikely to enter the minds of those acting under the influence of drugs or alcohol, those who are in the grip of fear or rage, those who are panicking while committing another crime, or those who are suffering from mental illness or impairment and do not understand the gravity of their crime. In the United States and other countries around the world, the death penalty is disproportionately used against the poor, ethnic and religious minorities, and people suffering mental illness. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we have any hope of ever achieving the ideal equal justice systems across the world to make a lasting and permanent reduction in crime, then we need to end the death penalty in all countries. Nobody has said it better than Gandhi: 'An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind'.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  by leaveâ€”I thank all those members who have contributed to this debate. I say again that this is the time in which we need to be focused on bringing these insidious practices to an end. We do not want to be in a situation where we see other Australians executed abroad. I must say, for my own part, I do not want to see a situation where people are executed abroad, full stop. There needs to be change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can remember when I was a young law studentâ€”and that was a few years agoâ€”I was lectured in criminology. There were studies that were undertaken, even that long ago, which demonstrated that most offences for which people are sentenced to lifeâ€”or, as it was previously, to deathâ€”were acts of passion unlikely to be influenced by the severity of the sentence. I think that those who look around the world and say, 'Well they got their just deserts; they deserved to be executed,' need to understand that execution there says something about the state that does it and, certainly, not about the individual that is involved. Sometimes these are matters that arise that are not premeditated but simply a result of some spontaneity, and the law, itself, is unlikely to deter them. I am very focused and believe that the parliament needs to play a very active role encouraging the Foreign Minister to lead on these issues abroad. But I encourage every member of parliament, when they are travelling abroad, to raise these matters well. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr SOUTHCOTT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:05</span>):  On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I wish to make a statement concerning the committee's decision on the appointment of the Auditor-General.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has the responsibility under the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951 to approve or reject a proposed recommendation for appointment to the office of Auditor-General. The committee is also required to report its decision to parliament. This is a significant statutory duty of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. As an independent officer of the parliament, the Auditor-General is responsible for ensuring accountability and transparency in the delivery of government programs and services. It is therefore appropriate that the committee has the power to scrutinise a nomination to this important position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Accordingly, I am pleased to take this opportunity to advise the House that on 14 May this year the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit unanimously approved the appointment of Mr Grant Hehir as the new Auditor-General. The Auditor-General is appointed by the Governor-General, under the Auditor-General Act 1997, for a term of 10 years, and Mr Hehir is due to commence office on 11 June 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Hehir is currently the New South Wales Auditor-General and has held a range of positions in state and Commonwealth public sectors. He was the Secretary of the Victorian Department of Treasury and Finance for seven years and held senior positions in the Commonwealth Department of Finance and the Treasury. Mr Hehir is a Fellow of CPA Australia and the Institute of Public Administration Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also takes this opportunity to acknowledge the significant achievements of Mr Ian McPhee AO, PSM, who has served as Auditor-General for the past 10 years. On behalf of the committee, I thank Mr McPhee for his dedicated commitment to improving public sector accountability, promoting better practice public administration, assisting the parliament in holding executive government to account and informing the wider Australian community of the state of public administration. To borrow from Gilbert and Sullivan, Ian McPhee has been the model of a modern Auditor-General.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee wishes Mr Hehir well in his new role, and looks forward to building on the already strong working relationship between the joint committee and the Australian National Audit Office under Mr Hehir's leadership as Australia's new Auditor-General.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">DMO has played a strong and positive role in the development of the MPR since its inception in the mid- to late-2000s. With DMO's abolition and the Department of Defence reabsorbing the DMO's functions, the committee expects the department to continue working on the MPR with the same intensity shown by the DMO over the past eight years.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee, in conjunction with Defence and ANAO, is now focussed on establishing a mechanism through which sustainment reporting can be better scrutinised. Sustainment expenditure is currently at approximately $5 billion per annum and predicted to increase significantly over time. The committee considers sustainment spending to be an area requiring further parliamentary scrutiny on the adequacy and performance of Defence involving billions of dollars in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Objections in the past by DMO/Defence to providing further information on sustainment have centred on security issuesâ€”that is, that more detailed reporting of sustainment in the public arena would compromise national security. The committee is in complete agreement with Defence about the need to protect classified information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having had a series of options presented to the committee by ANAO, initial discussions with Defence have already occurred and, at this stage, it appears likely that sustainment reporting will be developed through an evolutionary process until both the committee and Defence are comfortable with a final structure, not unlike the development of the MPR itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee, along with ANAO, DMO and the Department of Defence, has worked diligently and constructively over the past eight years to progress the MPR to where it is today. The reforms to the department are designed to bolster efficiency and they should not result in a diminution of the intensity with which Defence approaches its work. The committee looks forward to working with the new reformed Department of Defence to produce the same high-quality MPR in the future so as to ensure that the improvement gains made in terms of project acquisition management over the past eight years are maintained. This also applies to the new sustainment reporting that the committee, ANAO and Defence are now embarking upon.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Charlton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:13</span>):  by leaveâ€”I want to echo the fine words from the chair of the committee on the excellent work done by the committee secretariat, the DMO and the ANAO on what is a very important process for parliament holding Defence to account on the delivery of platforms so vital to the ADF. I just want to highlight some key aspects of the testimony from our hearing in February, which I think we should note. First off, on the highly contentious Collins class submarine project, we had a very good discussion with Vice Admiral Griggs, the chief of the capability development group, who said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ Collins is a highly capable weapons system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In terms of operational performance, it has been very good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is very relevant with regard to the myths out there that somehow the Collins class submarines are poor performers. This was Vice Admiral Griggs saying that they are a very capable weapons system. Ms McKinnie, who is a senior DMO executive, when talking about the quality of the build of the Collins class submarines, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the quality of welding done in Australia was extremely high.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is especially so when you compare it to the problems in the manufacture of other submarines of that vintage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a good discussion on the air warfare destroyer project. DMO executives basically acknowledged that a lot of the problems we are experiencing now have very little to do with the workforces of the various shipyards but have everything to do with the nature of the acquisition strategy adopted in the first place in 2005-06. The decision to go for an alliance was problematic; the decision to go for an alliance structure without having the ship designer, Navantia, in the alliance was problematic; and there was a lack of understanding of the difference in cultures between the European shipyards that had been building the F100 class and the Australian shipyards. That was quite illuminating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also discussed Land 400, where, quite frankly, there was some very disturbing testimony by the DMO that there were no opportunities for locally based manufacture of these very important Army vehicles. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ there are opportunities for assembly. I would not suggest there are opportunities for manufacture. â€¦ There is the possibility of flat pack assembly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this is all we can expect to get out of a very significant Army project, it is very troubling, given the performance of locally manufactured platforms, such as the Bushmaster, overseas. I know there were a group of parliamentarians who got to see that firsthand on a quite recent trip. So we should not be so ready to discount the performance of Australian manufacturing in (a) delivering quality platforms to the ADF and (b) providing great jobs for locals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to the fourth element of the testimony that I wanted to discuss, which is the debate around the Hawkei vehicle versus the JLTV, the joint light tactical vehicle, that the US Armed Forces are delivering. When this project was first envisaged, there was a very strong push by the Defence hierarchy just to sign up to the JLTV. But Australian industry were very passionate about the fact that they could produce a platform that would be safe, on schedule and on budget, and there were some very brave decisions made by politicians in this place about four or five years back that gave local industry a chance to compete on this project. I am comforted to be able to say that during the testimony we heard nothing but good news about the Hawkei project. In fact, it is clear that it has become the de facto choice for this acquisition, with the JLTV as the fallback. It is interesting to note that the testimony revealed that the JLTV is running 3Â½ years behind schedule. So the Australian option is going well; the US option has now become the fallback option, partly because it is 3Â½ years behind schedule. That is good news for Australian industry. It is a testament to the brave decisions made in this place a few years ago and it is a testament to the passion of the former member for Bendigo, Mr Gibbons, who was very committed to delivering for his region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will briefly build on the comments by the chair of the committee, Dr Southcott, about the <span style="font-style:italic;">First Principles Review</span> and the impact on the DMO Major Projects Report and acquisition strategy. I note that the principles review's recommendation to reintegrate the DMO goes against the evidence and recommendations of their Kinnaird and Mortimer reviews; and it goes against the evidence of the Major Projects Report, which found that 80 per cent of the cumulative 93 years of schedule delay occurred before DMO's separation from Defence. Let me repeat that: in the Major Projects Report, there are 93 years of schedule delay across those 30 projects, and 80 per cent of that slippage is in projects that were approved before the DMO was separated from the department. So I do have concerns about that recommendation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that we need to improve the workforce of the Capability Development Group and I acknowledge we need to improve the commercial and industrial focus of both the CDG and DMO; but we need to avoid too strong a bureaucratic concentration. We need to maintain contestability and we need to make sure that we have the appropriate commercial and industrial focus so we can deliver the best platforms to the ADF on budget and on schedule. I do have reservations about this response, but we will see how it goes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude by thanking the committee secretariat, the DMO and the ANAO for their contributions to this report, and I thank the chair for the manner in which he conducted the inquiry.</span>

Section 119.2 of the Criminal Code makes it an offence to enter or remain in an area of a foreign country declared by the foreign minister. The committee is able to review all declarations made under the provisions within the 15-sitting-day disallowance period, and this report contains the committee's findings with respect to the declaration of the Mosul district of northern Iraq. This is the second time that an area has been declared for these purposes, following the declaration of al-Raqqa province in Syria, in December last year. Like al-Raqqa, the Mosul district has been declared due to the hostilities of Daesh in the area.</span>

ASIO's statement of reasons for the declaration provides examples of where Daesh has committed actions in Mosul that meet the threshold of 'engaging in hostilities' against all the criteria listed in the Criminal Code. Among others, atrocities committed by Daesh in Mosul have included the execution of 13 teenage boys for watching a sports match, the mass execution of around 600 mainly Shiah inmates at a prison, the torture and execution of a woman's rights activist, and the destruction of many historical and religious sites.</span>

Mosul is also a central location for foreign extremists engaging in the conflict in Iraq. The committee will continue to monitor the effect of declarations on the actions of individuals over time, including the impact of any prosecutions that take place as a result of the declarations. The committee also supports initiatives to counter the propaganda being used by Daesh to draw young Australians into the conflicts in Iraq in Syria and considers that sustained effort will be needed by both governments and communities to ensure the facts of the situations in those countries are made known to the persons who are most vulnerable.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are further cuts to families on the lowest incomeâ€”more than $6,000 a year by the end of the forward estimates according to new NATSEM modelling that was released over the weekend and more than $100 a week for families with incomes of $55,000 a year or less. Again, as well as the changes to family tax benefit and the changes to paid parental leave, a continuing change is proposed for the age pension assets test that will seriously affect retireesâ€”and all of this at a time when the government is having a look at what they can do to retirees but absolutely refusing Labor's proposal to do something on the very generous tax concessions to very high-income earners.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of cuts to individual organisations in our electorates, and more of those become apparent every week as the true effect of this budgetâ€”the headline figuresâ€”gets translated into what it means for cuts on the ground for individual services. Many members of parliament have been contacted by their community legal centres. I have the Redfern legal centre in my own electorate. The Redfern legal centre is facing the prospect of reducing its general legal team services by about half. That means turning away up to 500 disadvantaged clients in the next year, many of whom are victims of domestic violence who rely on this service. The Marrickville legal centre, which is not strictly in my electorate but serves many of my constituents, is facing cuts of a similar scope, and legal centres right across the country are facing similar cuts, really compromising their ability to serve their most disadvantaged clients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as the massive cuts to hospitals last year and the proposal last year to introduce a GP co-payment, in the area of health we see a continuing freeze on the Medicare Benefits Schedule. In effect what is being asked of doctors is that they take a four-year pay freeze, that they actually not be able to keep up with the cost of providing services to their patients at the increasing cost of providing services. And what does the AMA say about that? The AMA says it is likely that GPs will be forced to charge an $8 co-payment anyway, despite the fact that the government has realised that they cannot get their formal co-payment through the parliament. There will be this co-payment by stealth. But in this budget there is about another $2 billion cut from health, including $500 million cut from drug and alcohol abuse treatment and sexual health care and other huge cuts to dental servicesâ€”to kids dental and veterans dental.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was delighted to hear the Prime Minister talking about tackling the terrible epidemic of ice that we have in our communities. It is breaking apart families and it is destroying communities, including regional and remote communities. It is a drug that is very addictive and takes a huge physical toll on users but is also creating social havoc in our communities. One of the things that is most disappointing about the cuts to the health Flexible Funds is that these are the very organisations that are working with drug addicts to help them stop using drugs. You cannot on one hand say that we are interested in tackling the ice epidemic on our streets, in our communities and in our families and on the other hand rip money away from the very services that are out thereâ€”few and far betweenâ€”helping addicts to stop using drugs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Haymarket Foundation is an organisation that I had a lot to do with in my electorate, but because of redistributions it is now slightly outside my electorate. The foundation is facing taking services away from its clientsâ€”clients who instead of going to the Haymarket Foundation will end up in our hospital emergency departments, or they will end up in our police holding cells, or they will end up in our mental health services, because they do not have the primary care that the Haymarket Foundation is able to give them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You have to read the fine print in this budget to see the level of damage that these cuts will have in our communities. We have seen cuts to the Australia Council as well. Interestingly, the minister, Senator Brandis, has decided that he is better qualified to decide on arts funding than the arts organisations are. I am sure the beautiful design of his bookcase tells us that he does have an eye for the finer things in life. But it is unusual and irregular to have an independent system that is brought instead under the control of the minister in the way that it seems the minister is proposing in this instance.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard some weeks ago that the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy is funded for another year, and we were asked to wait until the budget to find out how that was going to happen. Well, it has happened by taking $150 million from the Sustainable Research Excellence schemeâ€”again, robbing Peter to pay Paul. That is the pattern of this budget: give with one hand, take away with the other. The childcare funding that the government has so trumpeted, which does not start until 2017, depends on $3Â½ billion worth of extra spending in child care. That has been $1 billion cut from the last budget, and we are told by the government that this extra funding will depend on $1 billion more cut from paid parental leave and $5Â½ billion cut from family tax benefit. So, the cuts start straightaway, or as soon as the government can get them through the parliament, but the new childcare funding of course does not start until 2017, which presumably is after the next election.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also true for pensioners. The government has realised that this parliament will not let them pass their unfair changes to pension indexation. So the government said, 'Okay; fair cop; we will give up on pension indexation but instead we will still go to a retirement age of 70'â€”the highest in the developed worldâ€”'and the $1.3 billion cut to pensioner concessions and the funding to aged care', including I think one of the cruellest cuts of all, which is the funding to the dementia supplement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that it is very difficult to find a place in aged care for someone with dementia or challenging behaviours. Providers are hesitant to provide those places unless they have the trained staff and the necessary ratio of staff. Indeed, sometimes they need physical upgrading of their premises. They are very unwilling to take on the extra responsibility of caring for people with dementia and challenging behaviours if they do not have the extra funding. It is a perfectly understandable and explicable position for aged-care providers to take. Cutting the dementia supplement is really saying to families, 'You're on your own.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget fails the fairness test that we set at the time of the last budget, but it also fails the government's own economic credibility test. Debt is up. The deficit is up. Taxes are up. Unemployment is up and is staying up for longer. One of the most extraordinary things about this budget is that, at the same time as it is unfair to Australians and it rips $6,000 away from ordinary Australian families, it still manages to double the deficit so that the predicted deficit for next year has gone from just over $17 billion to over $30 billion. It increases debt. There are 17 new taxes and charges. Tax as a share of the economy is higher than it ever was under the previous Labor government. It has not been as high as a share of our economy since the Howard years. Unemployment is at a 14-year high. Coming out of the global financial crisis, economies around the world are picking up and employment is increasing. Australia, having survived the global financial crisis in a better condition than most comparable economies, has actually gone backwards on unemployment. Unemployment is at a 14-year high.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are always willing to work constructively with the government on measures to improve the budget bottom line. Indeed, in last year's budget we supported over $20 billion worth of measures that improved the budget bottom line. In his speech at the Press Club last week, our shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, pointed to a number of other measures that we are likely to support in this budget, including: the change to taxation of work and holiday visa holders; the abolition of the large family bonus; the removal of the zone tax offset for fly-in fly-out workers; changes to work related car expense deduction methods; and the implementation of the 'no jab, no pay' policy. That at least will provide about $2.4 billion over the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we proposed $20 billion of savings over the next 10 years. That was announced several weeks before the budget. We hoped that the government would follow our lead on preventing large multinational companies from avoiding taxation. We thought they might follow our lead there or at least work cooperatively with Labor to recoup some of those billions of dollars of taxes that are being diverted from Australia. Nopeâ€”no deal. We thought maybe they would be interested in slightly trimming very generous superannuation tax concessions for very high-income earners. Again, there was no deal. So that is over $20 billion in improvements that the government could have had if they had been prepared to work cooperatively with us that they have rejected. This budget, as last year's, is unfair. The devil is in the details. You need to read the fine print. As well as being unfair, it fails the most basic economic test that this government set for themselves.</span>

                    <a href="00APG" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TONY SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:41</span>):  It is a pleasure to speak on these appropriation bills for the 2015 budget. In doing so, I want to speak about the benefit the budget brings at a national level and also at a local level in the outer eastern suburbs of the Yarra Valley in the electorate of Casey that I have the honour of representing. The budget does a number of beneficial things. It continues the very important task of budget repair and, at the same time, it has critical initiatives to build a stronger economy with more jobs. As the Treasurer outlined on budget night, when this government won office it faced cumulative deficits over the forward four years of $123 billion. That has now been brought down to $82 billion over the next four years. A lot has been achieved. A lot more has to be done, as the Treasurer outlined. As a result of the legacy of net debt left by those opposite, we were borrowing $133 million a day. That is now down to $96 million. We are on the right track. There is more to be done. This is being achieved through choppy waters, with the iron ore price falling far more than anyone anticipated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, critically, the budget does a number of things to build a stronger economy into the future. It does this particularly by focusing on the vitally important small business sector, the backbone of the economy nationally and within our electorates. Those initiatives in the budget for small businessâ€”they are really the centrepieceâ€”will do an incredible amount to support small business to grow and employ more people. That is the focus. It does it in a number of ways. It does it by reducing the company tax rate down to 28.5 per cent. For those unincorporated businesses, it introduces a five per cent tax discount up to $1,000 a year, which is the best equivalence. It means all small businesses below that $2 million threshold benefit from a tax cut. On top of that, from budget night, those same small businesses can claim an immediate tax deduction for each and every item they purchase up to $20,000. As the Treasurer said, that is going to benefit 96 per cent of Australian businesses. More than two million of those have a turnover of less than $2 million a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This huge initiative has understandably been widely welcomed by the small business sector and by many of those organisations that represent them so well. I will just take the time of the House to mention a few of them. Peter Strong, the chief executive of COSBOA, had this to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the immediate deductibility for assets purchased up to $20k is as unexpected as it is welcomed. The 5% tax discount for unincorporated small business is another highlight of the budget. There are many more highlights in this budget which provides the lowest tax rate for small business since 1967. The government has promised something special for small business and have delivered on that promise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tonight is a fantastic night for small business owners who should be celebrating all around the nation. Firstly because of the financial support to assist them to invest in and grow their businesses, and secondly because of the recognition of the critical role they play in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget does those things. It recognises the critical role small businesses play in our economy in terms of providing jobs and their prospects for providing jobs into the future. That is why the member for Dunkley has worked long and hard in crafting this package, which makes up a suite of measures designed to boost small business and boost small business jobs. In the electorate of Caseyâ€”with outer metropolitan suburbs, the Yarra Valley and the Dandenong Rangesâ€”that breadth and depth of small businesses will benefit. In the electorate, small business owners are seizing the opportunity that the budget provides for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Critically, these measures build on a number of other critical initiatives. In the course of last year, the government moved with initiatives on employee share ownership to reverse the devastating damage caused by the reckless changes made by those opposite back in 2009. On top of that, it is working on new initiatives in crowd funding to boost innovation and enterprise. The other critical initiative in the budget is for businesses just starting up. The Treasurer outlined some of the immediate write-offs that those businesses get in their start-up costs. That is another critical thing for those wanting to start a business; they know that they can write-off their costs. That is something that will go a long way for those taking that step to start a business. In the electorate of Casey, these initiatives are welcomed by the many thousands of small business owners. Many have worked very hard to create their business and what they want to do is built it further and to employ more locals. These initiatives will help significantly in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the local level, there are a number of measures that were pledged by me prior to the last election that are contained within this budget. They are helping to build a stronger local economy and a stronger and safer community. I just want to mention some of those in the time available this afternoon. On the Green Army program, the Yarra Valley landscape project has been completed in and around Healesville and Coldstream. A dedicated group of 18- to 24-year-olds worked for six months restoring parks, removing weeds and working with local volunteer groups. It was a pleasure to go out to Healesville with the Minister for the Environment for the graduation ceremony of that important project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the same day, I was able to show the minister the beginnings of the work at the next Green Army project in Casey. That is the Mount Evelyn aqueduct. A group of dedicated participants have started work there and are working for the next five or six months restoring that important area for the natural environment in and around Mount Evelyn. There are two other projects that will occur in the coming months. They are a project in Monbulk and a project along the Warburton Rail Trail. This is a very important program that the government pledged prior to its election and that is being rolled out with great success in the Casey electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of sporting groups do so much not just in terms of bringing the community together but also at a wider level as well. I just want to mention some of those. The Mount Evelyn Football Netball Club do a lot for the Mount Evelyn community. One of the things that I pledged prior to the last election was to provide funding with council for a netball change room facility to be installed there at the Mount Evelyn Football Netball Club. The club is quite innovative in how they have gone about funding this. They have used the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE to construct it, so it has been a great project for the students involved. We pledged $45,000, which has been delivered. The council matched that funding and the club contributed as well. In the coming weeks, that will be fully operational. That will be a great win for the Mount Evelyn netballers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Monbulk, we pledged that we would co-fund the resurfacing of the netball court and the construction of new shelters to the tune of $15,000. It was great to go to the Monbulk Netball Club and see the finished works just a week or so ago. The Monbulk Soccer Club is receiving significant federal funds, state funds and council funds to construct a huge facility that will have three full-sized synthetic pitches, a pavilion, lighting and a car park. It was a pleasure to see that project get underway. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Yarra Valley in particular the tourism industry is absolutely vitalâ€”many small businesses in the tourism sector and many small business who would not see themselves as part of the tourist sector are of course very much a part of it. The small business initiatives are very beneficial to the tourism industry, but on-the-ground infrastructure matters incredibly as well. That is why before the last election we pledged that we would contribute $3.5 million to the construction of the Yarra Valley Tourist Railway. This will reconstruct the railway between Yarra Glen and Healesville as a tourist railway. The money has been provided and the bridges are being constructed as we speak. When it is concluded it will do so much to bring more tourists into Yarra Valleyâ€”day tourists from across Melbourne but also international tourists. It is all part of building the tourism sector to build a stronger economy. Those communities in the Yarra Valley know that getting the right policies in the budget matters. They welcome the small business tax initiatives and the immediate write-offs but they also welcome getting more customers, and this important infrastructure will help to deliver that. The railway is one of a number of pledges that were fully funded and are being rolled out in this budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time available I will mention a few more. One is the $110,000 to the Metropolitan Traffic Education Centre, METEC, in Kilsyth. This is a volunteer-run organisation set up more than 40 years ago by a group of dedicated parents. It is a safe off-road driver training school. The grant that we have provided has enabled them to double the size of their car control skid pan area so they can train more young drivers in a safe off-road environment. For an electorate such as Casey, where you have many dangerous roads in the Dandenong Ranges and the Yarra Valley, this facility and those who run it do a wonderful job. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I mentioned was initiatives to create a safer community, and one of the initiatives that I took to the last election was more security cameras in and around some of the key areas in the Yarra Valley, such as Lilydale, and the installation of security cameras in Yarra Junction and in the town of Healesville. Those security cameras will come online in the coming months. The work is being done at the moment and contractors have been appointed. It is something those towns will welcome. It is an important initiative in the budget that has enabled communities to be safer and it has a proven track record, particularly in Lilydale, where we had one of the first sets of security cameras installed back in 2004. This will add to that and it will add to the safety and security of those other towns that I have mentioned.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:56</span>):  In the appropriations bills that are before us, we are effectively dealing with what at times in our history have been quite heated debatesâ€”they used to be called supply billsâ€”and some of the most extraordinary moments in Australian politics have found their way into these debates. These days, given that we are not currently in a situation where oppositions are behaving quite the way they did in 1975, we find ourselves in a more measured debate but also with an opportunity of taking advantage of the standing order that applies only to these bills and to the Governor-General's address-in-reply where we are able to speak in a very broad-ranging way. It is necessary when you deal with this budget to speak in a broad-ranging way simply because the entire fiction of the fiscal approach of this government is made clear with the bills that are before us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the last election in a budget reply when the now Prime Minister was Leader of the Oppositionâ€”at this very dispatch box hereâ€”he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">People can be confident that spending, debt and taxes will always be lower under a coalition government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a budget now where spending is higher, debt is higher and taxes are higher; notwithstanding that the guarantee from the then Leader of the Opposition was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">People can be confident that spending, debt and taxes will always be lower under a coalition government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, after the previous budget on 19 May last year, he said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">   but every day in the lead up to the last election, I said to people, 'We are going to get the Budget back under control.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The form of control has been to double the deficit in 12 months. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at what the then Leader of the Opposition now Prime Minister said in that first quote. He said that spending would be lower under the coalition, debt would be lower under the Coalition and taxes would be lower under the coalition. In terms of spending, in the four years that followed the global financial crisis while Labor was still in government, we established a rule on spending growth that spending growth would not exceed two per cent and applied that year-on-year. Over those four years, we did not simply have the rule in place that spending growth would not go to more than two per cent, we more than met it. Over those four years, spending growth in fact remained on average at 1.3 per cent year-on-year. Under the coalition, spending growth over the next lot of forward estimates, averages 1.8 per cent. They said spending would be lower under a coalition government. Labor had a rule it had to stay below two per cent and actually delivered 1.3 per cent. The coalition, looking forward, is at 1.8 per cent over the forward estimates. Spending is running at 25.9 per cent of GDPâ€”almost as high, within about 0.1 of one per cent, as it was during the global financial crisis. We had a need which was initially supported by both sides of politics but they then walked away from it. Had we in government walked away from the stimulus measures, if the then opposition had had their way, Australia would have gone into recession. The spending levels as a percentage of GDP are now nearly at that level again, without a global financial crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Prime Minister was the Leader of the Opposition he said the debt would always be lower under a coalition government. Well, under the coalition Australia's net debt is now $285.8 billionâ€”the highest it has been in the history of the nation. When people promise that something will be lower, it usually means delivering a smaller number than the previous one. For all this government have said about debt and deficit, year-on-year they have doubled the deficit and Australia's net debt is now the highest it has been in the history of the nation. Net debt under the coalition continues to grow in nominal terms each and every year over the forward estimates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister when Leader of the Opposition also promised taxes would always be lower under a coalition government. Over the period Labor was in government tax receipts averaged 20.8 per cent of GDP. Under the coalition today, tax receipts will average 22.6 per cent of GDP over the budget forward estimates. So under Labor, 20.8; under the coalition, 22.6. Tax receipts as a percentage of GDP are forecast to be at levels which have not been seen since the years of the Howard government. Through the entirety of the period, from the peak in the Howard government through to now, with all those years that Labor was in office in between, tax receipts were lower. This is not some small, tiny, marginal gapâ€”it is from 20.8 per cent to 22.6 per cent of GDP. This is a marked shift by this governmentâ€”spending growth is higher, taxes are higher, debt is higher.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the deficit has doubled year-on-year. There has been an argument about how you view the figures for Labor's final budget and final period in office. But you do not need to get into that argument to see whether or not the deficit has doubledâ€”you only have to look at what this government presented last year in its budget, where the deficit for this year was estimated to be $17 billion, and the budget they presented this year, where the deficit has turned out to be $35 billion. They were meant to have $17 billion last year and now we get to this year and we discover no, it is not $17 billion, it is $35 billion. For all their talk, they have come through and doubled the deficit. Ever since the pre-election forecasts made under the Charter of Budget Honesty in 2013, the deficit has blown out by $95 billion. That is the extent of it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer will say, regardless of everything he said when he was in opposition, 'Oh no, you can't blame me for revenue write-downs, you can't blame me for the iron ore price'â€”he will come forward with all the excuses that he would never allow his predecessors to use. We need to understand two things about this. First of all, the shift in the iron ore price does not completely explain the blow-out in the deficitâ€”not for a minute. Secondly, it also needs to be remembered that if Peter Costello could handle an Asian financial crisis and Wayne Swan could cope with a global financial crisis, why can't this Treasurer deal with a change in the iron ore price? All Treasurers have to deal with changing global circumstances. You think of the enormity of the Asian financial crisis and you think of the enormity of the GFC, yet we now have a Treasurer who will allow the deficit to be doubled under his watch because he cannot handle a shift in the iron ore price. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that characterise public discussion of the budget, and understandably, is that people go to the budget documents and look at what is in there but they often miss one key pointâ€”anything that has not changed from the previous year's budget is not reported. The reporting of a budget is a reporting of the changes. Therefore, while it is not referred to in the budget documents, this budget still demands there be a shift to $100,000 degrees. This budget still demands cuts to family paymentsâ€”we have seen even today analysis from NATSEM showing that families are set to be up to $6,000 worse off through a combination of measures from last year and this year. This budget still demands that people work until they are 70 years of age before they are able to retire, and this budget still infers a GP tax because it is brought in by a freeze that means over the course of four years we get to a similar cut in income for GPs as the government was previously trying to do in one hit. Be in no doubt, the GP tax is alive and well in this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also the case that there are a number of new measures in this budget. We have already indicated through the shadow Treasurer's comments at the National Press Club last week that we will be supportive of some of them, and when the Leader of the Opposition spoke at the dispatch box last Thursday he made clear there would be a number of measures we would support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It comes as no surprise that we are willing to support the small business measures, given that they were pretty close to measures that we had in place that this government abolished. They abolished some of them only in the last budget. So we apologise for not getting too excited in the fanfare about these being reintroduced. They were in fact our measures. In the case of the business tax cut, that was one that we put to the parliament and the coalition combined with the Greens to prevent it from going ahead. The instant asset write-off we did get through, and that was abolished in last year's budget. But there is a song and dance now, as though these are brand-new ideas from the coalition. Yes, they are good measures. Yes, we had them in place. I hope the government has the competence to make sure that they are implemented carefully and prudently, and obviously we will be watching that very closely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also a number of measures which contribute $2.4 billion to the bottom line over the forward estimates which the shadow Treasurer has indicated that we will support. These were made up of the zone tax offset, tax changes for temporary working holiday makers, work related car expense deductions, the cessation of the large family supplement of family tax benefit part A and the 'no jab, no pay' immunisation changes. We trust that the costings of those put forward by the government are all accurate, but those are all changes that contribute to the budget bottom line that we have already indicated we will support. There are a number of other changes that we are still working our way through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is often forgotten by those opposite that in the last budget more than $20 billion worth of improvements to the budget bottom line were facilitated by the opposition. More than $20 billion worth of improvements to the budget bottom line went through without opposition from Labor. Similarly, though, Labor has gone further in putting forward more than $20 billion worth of additional improvements to the budget bottom line over the next decade through our new policy on multinational tax avoidance and our proposals to deal with high-income superannuation. The government has knocked them out straight away, notwithstanding that they would improve the budget bottom line over the decade of another $20 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why have they knocked them out? They have knocked out the changes on multinational tax because they have their own idea, with no numbers attached to itâ€”just an asterisk in the budget papers. On high-income superannuation, they are willing to go after pensioners but they are not willing to get an additional contribution from people earning more than $250,000 a yearâ€”an extraordinary approach when cooperation is offered across the table but pretty symptomatic of how this government operates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to conclude by referring to one specific change in this year's budget, because it goes to something that was part of a particular budget debate I was involved in at the time of the last election. At the last election, as some members may be aware, among my portfolio as I was Australia's Minister for the Arts. I had a debate against Senator Brandis. It was sort of a debate: we arrived separately, left separately and were never at the podium or near each other at any point in time. It probably worked fine for both of us. But in that debate I made the comment that I had a view that Senator Brandis did not believe in arms-length funding for the arts. He responded, and it was published, by describing what I had said as a 'spectacularly brazen lie'. Yet all I was predicting was exactly what has happened in this year's budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Be in no doubt about the level of arrogance of an arts minister who thinks that he will be able to pick and choose more effectively than the arms-length funding arrangements for the Australia Council put in place under the Fraser government, expanded under the Whitlam government. We have an arts minister so arrogant that he thinks he can get away with calling an accurate description of his policy a 'spectacularly brazen lie' before the election, and now he goes through and delivers just that. Senator Brandis needs to know, and the public will know, arrogance does not get missed.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the House and Assistant Minister for Employment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:12</span>):  The budget that the government has delivered is a budget for confidence and it is a budget for families. It is a plan for jobs and it is a plan for growth. It is a plan for opportunity that will build a strong, safe and prosperous future for all Australians. Our economic plan is working. The economy is growing and jobs are being created in a fair and responsible way. Labor's projected debt and deficit have been cut in half, which has made Australia stronger and is allowing the coalition to invest more in better services for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has a credible plan to get the country back to surplus despite tough economic challenges ahead. The budget is good for families, the budget is good for small business and the budget is good for jobs. It delivers a small business tax cut which will help drive investment and deliver jobs, creating prosperity for all Australians. It delivers a better childcare system that is simpler, more affordable, more flexible and more accessible. It provides parents with greater choice in balancing work and family, making life easier for working mums and dads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's longstanding and ongoing commitment to jobs, particularly for young Australians, is also embodied in our $330 million Youth Employment Strategy. When I travel around the country, I meet with many young people who are having a tough time getting into work. I hear the same thing time and time again. Young people say, 'You can't get experience when you don't have a job, and if you can't get a job you can't get experience.' This is a simple and sensible proposition that young people put forward: 'How can I get a job if I don't have experience? How can I get experience if I don't have a job?' That goes some way to explaining that the youth unemployment rate is twice the national average, at 13.6 per cent. If you cannot get your first job, how can you get that experience?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition acknowledges that the youth unemployment rate is too high and we are taking the problem of youth unemployment seriously because we know that the best form of welfare is a job. While the best thing we can do to create jobs is to build a strong economy, the government recognises that young people need extra help. That is why we have announced the Youth Employment Strategy in the budget, because it will take a work first approach to Australia's youth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's $330 million Youth Employment Strategy has three key components. First is the $212 million Youth Transition to Work program, which will deliver intensive pre-employment assistance to young job seekers who are at high risk of unemployment. This program will assist around 19,000 job seekers every year with basic skill development that employers often report young job seekers are lacking. This includes mentoring and coaching to address personal issues; developing literacy, numeracy, teamwork and communication skills; providing access to work experience; and helping young people to get driver's licences, apprenticeships and traineeships. As part of this strategy, the coalition has also committed more than $105 million to support vulnerable job seekers, including young parents, young people with a mental illness, and refugees and migrants, as they make the transition to work. This includes an innovative youth program which will fund up to 40 community trials to explore better ways of getting young people who are at risk of welfare dependency into jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this support, we are also raising expectations of early school leavers who are receiving welfare. Early school leavers who do not want to study will be subject to new job search requirements, and those who choose to study will be required to reach at least year 12 or certificate III standard, instead of the current year 12 or certificate II standard. This will substantially increase the employment prospects of early school leavers, because those with a certificate III or higher have a 4.9 per cent unemployment rate, as compared to those with a certificate I or certificate II, who have a 12.7 per cent unemployment rate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the Youth Employment Strategy, the coalition is creating a $1.2 billion wage subsidy pool to make it easier for employers to hire people from disadvantaged groups. Tens of thousands of Australians, including mature age, young job seekers, parents, the long-term unemployed and Indigenous Australians, are expected to access this subsidy. The subsidy pool will kick-start another 2015 budget initiative, the national work experience program. This program supports job seekers, who can volunteer to do four weeks work experience for up to 25 hours a week in either a for-profit or a not-for-profit business. Employers that hire a new employee who is eligible for a wage subsidy through the work experience program can access subsidies through the $1.2 billion pool we are creating. This is a great initiative for all job seekers, because the existing work experience arrangements show job outcome rates of around 50 per cent for those people who participate in work experience programs. The new initiative announced in the budget will build on the existing coalition commitments to help Australia's youth get jobs. The coalition is committing $6.8 billion over the next four years to a new employment service model called jobactive, which reinvigorates Work for the Dole, reduces red tape for job seekers and reduces red tape for employment service providers and employers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since July last year nearly 24,000 people have commenced Work for the Dole in selected locations around Australia as part of phase 1. Come 1 July, the Work for the Dole program will be expanded nationwide. Job seekers, young job seekers in particular, can benefit from the Relocation Assistance to Take Up a Job program, which provides financial assistance to long-term unemployed who are moving to take up a job. They can also access the job commitment bonus, which provides cash bonuses to successful job seekers after they have stayed in a job and off welfare for 12 or 24 months. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Put simply, the Abbott government has committed billions to addressing unemployment, and youth unemployment specifically. This is a longstanding and ongoing commitment. It is in stark contrast to Labor. In his budget reply speech, the opposition leader, Mr Shorten, did not even mention youth unemployment, and to date the opposition have only committed some $21 million to help some 3,000 unemployed youth. Compared to Labor, the coalition has committed 15 times the money to help 15 times the job seekers into work. Through our Youth Employment Strategy, the coalition is taking a work-first approach to tackling youth unemployment, because everyone knows the best form of welfare is a job. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we also know that the best way to grow jobs is to have a strong economy and we know that a thriving small business sector is the centre of a strong economy. That is why the coalition's budget is great for small business, particularly for small businesses in my electorate of Cowper. On 1 July 2015, all small businesses, even those that are not incorporated, will receive a tax cut. Incorporated small businesses with a turnover of up to $2 million will benefit from our cut to the company tax rate by 1.5 per cent to 28Â½ per cent. Unincorporated small businesses will get a five per cent tax discount, with those businesses with an annual turnover of up to $2 million receiving up to a maximum tax discount of $1,000. From budget night until 30 June 2017, small businesses will be able to immediately deduct every asset that they acquire which is valued up to $20,000. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Cowper, I have seen small businesses in my electorate grow and evolve over time, creating more jobs and opportunities for the people in the area that I represent. Through the Growing Jobs and Small Business package, the coalition is freeing up small business to create more jobs in my electorate and across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I meet with mums and dads in my electorate, time and time again they tell me that our childcare system is too complicated, too expensive and too hard to access when they need it most. Having two parents in work has become essential for most families because of changes to society and the economy in recent decades. Many families, in particular mothers, now have to juggle caring responsibilities with paid employment. This juggling act is made all the more difficult with the challenges they face in accessing affordable and suitable child care. That is why the coalition's $4.4 billion Jobs for Families package is such a great initiative. It will deliver a childcare system that is simpler, more affordable, more flexible and more accessible for Australian families who want to work more and set themselves up for the future. The coalition's families package will provide greater choice to more than 1.2 million families, including many in my electorate of Cowper. It will put downward pressure on the price of child careâ€”a very important measure, as the cost of child care is a major inhibitor to people getting into work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget will not only deliver for families and small business, but also continue the upgrade of the Pacific Highway at a pace. Since the coalition has come to office, the rate of work on the Pacific Highway has increased significantly. The previous government had backflipped on its commitment to 80-20 funding for the Pacific Highway, instead insisting on a 50-50 funding mix. Had the Labor government been re-elected at the last election, the Pacific Highway completion date would have been delayed by some seven years. So, as a result of the election of the coalition government and the continued funding that is available in this budget, the Pacific Highway will be completed by the target date of 2020â€”some seven years sooner than it would have been completed under Labor. We have a range of projects currently underway in the electorate. Frederickton to Eungai section is being completed at a pace. Kundabung to Kempsey is underway; Urunga to Nambucca Heads is well on target; and we have new work recently started on the Warrell Creek to Nambucca Heads section and the Arrawarra to Ballina section. These are huge infrastructure projects, creating thousands of jobsâ€”many local jobs and thousands of indirect jobs, which are important for the local economy as an employment generator and important to our national interest to ensure that freight can move quickly and efficiently around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Local roads are also vitally important. Whenever I speak to constituents, they often raise the issue of the importance of local roads. This budget will deliver record local road funding for councils in my electorate through the Roads to Recovery program. Following on from the Deputy Prime Minister's announcement that Roads to Recovery funding would be doubled in 2015-16, more than $8 million will be given to five local councils in my electorate. Great work is being done by my local councils in delivering with Roads to Recovery funding. We have also continued funding for the project at Riverside Drive in Nambucca Headsâ€”an important local arterial road that has become unserviceable due to geotechnical problems. Five million dollars from the federal government allows the local council to repair that important piece of road infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget has important measures in health, providing the continued funding for $80 million redevelopment of Kempsey Hospital. The new hospital will ensure that the Macleay community has local access to a new emergency medical unit and new integrated community care. It also ensures new medical equipment, such as X-ray, ultrasound, medical imaging, as well as new acute hospital beds, an expanded coronary care unit and new operating theatres, will become available. The development of Kempsey Hospital is being done in partnership with the state government, and this budget delivers the Commonwealth contribution to that hospital. It builds on the commitment by the New South Wales coalition government of $50 million for the redevelopment of Macksville Hospitalâ€”a project very passionately supported by the new state member for the seat of Oxley, Melinda Pavey. Kempsey and Macksville redevelopments are both examples of the coalition delivering on health and hospitals in regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an important new program in the budgetâ€”$45 million for the Stronger Communities program. My electorate of Cowper will receive $150,000 a year over two years to support local projects to deliver social benefits. This is vitally important to support the many organisations that do great work in our local areas. In conclusion, this government inherited from Labor a multibillion dollar deficit problem; it inherited a budget that was out of controlâ€”</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:27</span>):  In the brief time available, I intend to speak today about the impact of the second budget on the great electorate of Fraser. The electorate of Fraser is now the largest electorate in Australia with nearly 145,000 electors. This year's budget contains the same cuts in funding to health and education as last year's budget. That is $80 billion across the countryâ€”a $600 million loss to Canberra's schools, hospitals and health centres over the next decade as a result of this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, community groups around the country celebrated when the government backflipped on plans to cut $25 billion from the national legal assistance budget, but it turned out that that reprieve was only temporary. The government is drastically cutting funding for Community Legal Centres from 2017 onwards. In Canberra the ACT Women's Legal Centre and the Welfare Rights and Legal Centre are set to lose $300,000 from 2017. That may seem like a small amount of money, but to the Canberra women fleeing family violence and domestic abuse it may make the difference between being able to access the help they need and not being able to access that help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Education, that noted fixer, claimed that he had fixed the funding of the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy. His fix turned out to be to take $150 million from another tertiary research program to be plough into NCRIS. That, of course, leaves universities around Australia, including the Australian National University and the University of Canberra, facing new research cuts over the next few yearsâ€”$150 million this year, $37 million next year, $74 million the hereafter. The fixer has not fixed it; he has simply plugged one hole by ripping open another one. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the impact on Canberra of the cuts to Family Tax Benefit Part B. This is a government that is offering more resources to parents of two- to three-year-old children in child care on two conditions: firstly, they have to back cuts to families with six-year-olds receiving Family Tax Benefit Partâ€”on the bizarre notion that kids get cheaper, not more expensive, when they turned six. The second ransom hanging over the heads of these parents is that the only way they get more money for kids aged two or three is that they are willing to back money being taken away from new parents. This is a government that is pitting mum against mum. It just is not reasonable to call families 'rorters' and 'double dippers' because they are receiving a government funded scheme, as well one that they fought for in their workplace. In this budget, there also cuts to low-income families. There are cuts to health programs, including the Inborn Errors of Metabolism Programme, about which constituents have contacted me already since the budget came down. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  I rise today to say congratulations Ireland on becoming the first nation to legalise marriage equality by popular vote on the weekend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Marriage equality is increasingly becoming the norm around the world, having been already adopted in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Uruguay, England, Wales, Scotland and most US states. However, to see a nation who only decriminalised homosexuality in 1993 and only allowed divorce in 1996 take this step has truly captured the world's imagination. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was difficult not to get caught up in the outpouring of love and joy at the conclusion of the referendum. The spirit of the Irish has long tugged at the hearts of the sentimental around the world. Indeed, in his cringe worthy St Patrick's Day video message earlier this year, the Prime Minister quoted the historian Paddy O'Farrell when noting that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the Irish were the galvanising force at the centre of our evolving national character.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, let us all be galvanised by the result in Ireland on the weekend. Let us take heart that the vast majority of people do not want to see the perpetuation of petty and hurtful discrimination against their fellow human beings. Let us take reassurance from the result that equality in the eyes of the law need not be an affront to religion. I say to the Prime Minister, 'Get that green tie out again and follow the moral example of the Irish.' It is time the Prime Minister granted Liberal MPs a conscience vote on this issue so that the Australian parliament can get this issue right once and for all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  I rise to commend the Coorong District Council, the community of Tailem Bend and the Peregrine Corporation for working with the Commonwealth to secure the future of SA Motorsport Park, which will be located in Tailem Bend. I was delighted to help announce $7.5 million of federal government funding for essential access and service connections at that proposed facility. This is a massive win for South Australia; it is a big win for Barker and the Murraylands, and for Tailem Bend in particular. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">SA Motorsport Park will cement South Australia as the motorsport capital of Australia, with Tailem Bend the jewel in the crown. Once completed, this facility will provide a world-class trackâ€”the only one of its kind in the Southern Hemisphereâ€”for motorcycling, off-street drags, drifting, club sprints, motorkhanas, rallycross, four-wheel drives, driver training, and vehicle and component testing. It will include a drag strip, a rally track, a four-wheel drive adventure park, a go-karting facility, a hotel and a camping ground. I wish to pay tribute to Dr Sam Shahin and his team at Peregrine for developing this exciting vision and being prepared to invest in the people of the Murray Mallee to see that vision come to reality. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This project will boost employment opportunities locally, with 350 jobs created during the construction phase of the project and an additional 25 jobs thereafter. This exciting project is also yet another example of the benefits of the Murraylands as a place to do business, with vast space at affordable costs and a ready workforce all within 60 minutes of Adelaide's CBD. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  In 2007, Kingsford Smith mum Sophie Smith experienced her worst nightmare when she lost her baby triplets following their premature birth at Randwick's Royal Hospital for Women. Devastated but also grateful for the care that she received, Sophie set up the Running for Premature Babies group to help support the hospital's work and research into prematurity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 17 May, I joined 300 runners in the Running for Premature Babies team to take part in the Sydney Morning Herald Half Marathon, with a goal of raising $200,000 for this extremely worthy cause. I am pleased to report that we well and truly eclipsed that result, raising $273,000, which I am told is over a third of the moneys raised during the event. The outstanding effort took the group's nine-year fundraising total to an incredible $1.5 million. Much of that money is already making a difference in important research and work to take care of sick and premature babies. The goal is to improve outcomes and give tiny babies a much better chance at survival.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not just about raising money; the team has become a supportive community of runners, and many share the common bond of premature babies. Over the nine years, friendships have been forged and PBs have been smashed. Through it all, the spirit of Sophie's little ones continues to shine. I congratulate and thank all of the runners who took part in the Running for Premature Babies, in particular Mandi O-Sullivan Jones, the team coach, and of course the wonderful Sophie and Ashley Smith for all their hard work.</span>

I was pleased to attend, as a family member, the Pakenham Life Members presentation day and dedication of the bell. It was ably emceed by Jim Dore and Wayne Nutting and attended by Trevor Owen, assistant chief officer for the south eastern regions. There was a presentation to Lisa Hicks for service to the fire brigade. CFA service awards were presented to Kylie Shanks and Graham Love, and outstanding service awards were presented to Bruce Wicks and Charlie Lansdown. But the presentation of new life members was the highlight for Jean Kelsey, Rob Golding, Ann Ramsdale and Aunty Norma Jacksonâ€”of course, relations of mine, and not only relations but friends. I was not attending there as the federal member of parliament; I was only included as my wife's partner, but I was asked to respond at the end on behalf of the community. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Last Monday, the ANU released a very important evaluation on a project that a local legal centre had been conducting. The project is called 'Why didn't you ask?' It is a project of the Loddon Campaspe Community Legal Centre based in Bendigo, and its purpose is to work with families at risk of family violence. The project has proven to be very successful. The analysis provided by the Australian National University calls on all governments, state and federal, to continue to fund our legal centres and services to help continue the great work that this particular program has been doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Loddon Campaspe Community Legal Centre family violence legal team in Bendigo, Echuca and Maryborough courts has taught many women who arrive at court, who may not know, what their rights are. Funding for the 'Why didn't you ask?' program allowed the Loddon Campaspe community legal family violence centre to extend its support work from three to five courts in our region, including doing work in Kyneton and Swan Hill. All the analysis and all the suggestions is this early intervention and support for families works. I call on the government to continue to fund and support our legal centres and not continue with the cuts that they tried to proceed with last year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Last Saturday and Sunday, the 16 to 17 May, we saw one of the most wonderful and iconic events in our wonderful city of Penrithâ€”that is, the Relay for Life, which has been held in Penrith for the last 14 years. This year alone, the community of Penrith raised $253,217 for the Cancer Council. I do not think we could applaud enough the great work that the people of Penrith have done. I would like to talk about a few amazing teams that really did some wonderful work. The Manny Moo Moo team all dressed up in moo-cow onesies and cut laps of Howell Oval. The Manny Moo Moo team raised $27,162. Well done! I guess it pays to dress up in a moo-cow onesie. The inspiration behind the team is a young boy called Emmanuel, who, in January 2013 at the age of 11 months, was diagnosed with cancer. They are now celebrating Emmanuel as a survivor. There were some wonderful teams that had some wonderful results. In aid of this we are also hosting a Biggest Morning Tea which will be held at the St Marys Rugby League Club at 10.30 am on Friday. We invite everyone from the Penrith and St Marys communities to join us so that we can raise more funds for this wonderful charity and aid the battle to help stop cancer.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  Recently I had the pleasure of attending the Rath Yatra festival in Parramatta. Rath Yatra, also known as the Festival of Chariots, is one of the biggest and most auspicious Hindu festivals, and its history goes back thousands of years. The cultural celebration tells the story of Lord Jagannath. lord of the universe, when he leaves his palace temple and appears before the public to grant his blessings. The Rath Yatra festival symbolises his story by dragging a chariot through the streets. So big has that procession become over time, that it has spawned the word 'juggernaut' in recognition of the story of Lord Jagannath. It is a fantastic festival that displays some of India's finest cultural traditions, including music and dance. I was pleased to join the procession from Alfred Square in North Parramatta to Centenary Square in the heart of Parramatta's CBD. It is a festival that is so full of colour and music that I would not want to miss itâ€”and I will definitely be there again, as I was last year. I would especially like to thank the coordinator of the Festival of Chariots, Somendra Krsna Das, who is also secretary of Vedic Festival. I would like to thank also Varanayaka Das, President of ISKCON Sydney Group and Gambhir Watts OAM, President of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Australia for their support for this event. I really look forward to joining the Parramatta community in dragging that chariot through the streets again next year.</span>

Often it is not a big, national issue. Sometimes it can be the barking dog next door, or the cat infestation in the house next door. In any case, we need to remember that every time someone brings one of these issues to us it is the big thing for them at the time, and we have to try to do our best to do something about it. A federal issue but at a very small level is Telstra's apparent inability to maintain their service pits out on the streets of this nation. It has been the case for many years. How often do we see those yellow railings around the outside of these service pits, which are a risk to people but also an icon for Telstra's inability to get their job done. A lady raised it with me just the other day on a street called Pelican Parade in Ballajura. She told me the pit had been unmaintained and that it had been damaged for several weeks, possibly months. Then, just 200 metres down the street, there was another one; around the corner, another oneâ€”and these are almost epic in their numbers. I say to Telstra: 'It is about time you get on with your job. Get your job done. Get these maintenance pits fixed all the way around the country.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  As you know, country racing may not have the glamour and the glitz of spring carnivals in Melbourne and Sydney, but they have much more in atmosphere and community spirit. My favourite part of country racing is the picnic races, of which there are six in Indiâ€”in Alexandra, Dederang, Mansfield, Merton, Yea St Pat's and Yea. The Dederang picnic races is a typical country racing affair. Held traditionally on the first Saturday in January, this year Dederang celebrated 150 years of picnic racing. Last year they won the picnic race club of the year. On average 3Â½ thousand patrons flock to the small town of Dederang. They have a ball! They spread out all around the track and have a wonderful background of the beautiful Kiewa and Mitta valleys.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many other country race clubs, the Dederang picnic races are run by a thoroughbred team of volunteers. They liaise with Country Racing Victoria, take care of track maintenance, including watering, which is a very labour intensive job in summer. They do the spraying and the cutting and look after the horse stalls. I am delighted to welcome to this House today two stalwarts of Dederang picnic races. It gives me great pleasure to say, 'Hello', to Bev and Neville Seymour and to thank them for all the work you do to make the Dederang picnic races so successful. On average $5,000 is raised at Dederang at this meeting. This money is used to help the hall committee, the sports grounds, the local hospitals in Mount Beauty and Yackandandah. Thank you very much, Dederang. Fantastic job! <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In the electorate of Casey, the Mooroolbark community has a service at noon that has run for a number of years now organised by the local Lions Club. It has grown from small numbers in its initial days. Like many other services now, it has, as I said, become a feature of the Mooroolbark community and it is attended by large numbers of local residents.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to the organisers: Peter Giddings from Mooroolbark Lions and Chris Clifton, the honorary chaplain from the Lilydale RSL. One of the reasons this is a great success is that it involves so many parts of the Mooroolbark community, including the secondary schools in the area. On Anzac Day, scripture readings were read by Mooroolbark College school captains, Alisha Ryan and Zachary White. Yarra Hills Secondary College school captains, Chelsea Solomon and Mitchell Wilson, read prayers, and one of the addresses on the day was from 2014 Lions Mooroolbark Youth of the Year, James Cummings, who is in year 12 at Oxley College. They all did a great job. I wanted to make mention of them in the House and to the organisers, Peter Giddings and the team in the Mooroolbark Lions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  I stand to congratulate the people of Ireland on the decision they made a few days ago to grant LGBTI Irish citizens equal right to marriage. Ireland is one of the most religious countries in the world, but in doing this they have also shown themselves to be amongst the most open and the most loving. I feel I can confidently say that all of us in the chamber have friends or family who are in the LGBTI community. Certainly, we all represent thousands of people around the country who identify as LGBTI. It is time that the Australian law properly reflected the equality that we feel towards people who are LGBTI.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, we abhor discrimination and at times we have led the world in the fight against it, and I am so proud of that history. But sometimes, one of the biggest challenges in coming up against discrimination is identifying it and calling it out. Unequal marriage discriminates against LGBTI Australians. It says they are separate and they are different, and I stand today to say that that does not reflect my views, and it does not reflect the view of the majority of Australians. There are people who hold different viewsâ€”some in this chamberâ€”on the basis of their religion, and I respect those views. But I do not believe that you should get to say, because you hold those views, that our laws discriminate against thousands of people who live in our country. That is just not how good laws are made. The tide has turned. Ireland has moved, and I urge this parliament to build on this momentum and make marriage equal.</span>

In Hindmarsh, like all electorates, there are numerous volunteer organisations: Rotary, Lions, Apex, Neighbourhood Watch, Meals on Wheels, just to name a few. Neighbourhood Watch SA started in Flinders Park, a suburb in my electorate, and they recently celebrated 30 years of great community work. As a former committee member of the local neighbourhood watch, I have seen the important role they play in helping to keep our community safe. I try and attend many neighbour watch meetings as often as I can, and the Morphettville Neighbourhood Watch had a good turnout earlier this month. I want to congratulate Ross Bowles, the area coordinator, secretary Allan Wallis and all the members of the Morphettville Neighbourhood Watch on their good work for the community.</span>

I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the great work of Major Laurie Venables, who lives in Glenelg and who I have had the privilege of dealing with. Major Venables is an unsung hero. For 71 years he has dedicated time and effort to the Salvos. Major Venables has only once missed the Red Shield Appeal, and to quote Major Venables: 'It's what I was put on this earth to do.' He started collecting donations at the age of eight, and it was great to see a fantastic photo of him and his wife in today's Adelaide <span style="font-style:italic;">Advertiser</span>. Thank you to Laurie and all the volunteers out there for your outstanding contribution in the electorate of Hindmarsh.</span>

I visit schools for assemblies, to meet with student leaders, to have coffees with the principals and to do flag presentations and awards. But in the last few weeks I have had two very special visits where I have been invited into classrooms in schools to talk to students about our democracy and to talk to students about civics and citizenship. I visited St Clare's primary school, Truganina, and I visited Manor Lakes College, Wyndham Vale, in the past few weeks. I would like to thank St Clare's principal, Andrew Leighton, and senior teacher Bernadette O'Regan for the invitation, as well as principal Jason Smallwood and leading teacher Anthony Sabatino from Manor Lakes College in Wyndham Vale for the invitation to actually get involved and listen to and talk to students about our great democracy.</span>

They are incredibly connected to their learning. I met inquisitive children with a strong basis of knowledge about the levels of government and our system of government. It is a privilege to meet these young people in their classrooms, and it never fails to bear upon me the importance of our role in the House of Representatives in representing those communities.</span>

Take Yarroweyah Engineering. They developed a rotary dairy about 30 years ago which has changed the global industry. Over 2,700 of these dairies are now working in over 53 countries. This equates to more than one million cows being milked twice a day on their milking platforms. They employ 45 people in the tiny town of about 300. Then there is Sunweld in Shepparton. They invented the slab-line lawn bowls marker. Since 2001, Sunweld owner, Tony Farrell, has sold over 600 slab-line markers around Australia.</span>

They supply SPC Ardmona, amongst many other food factories. And, of course, last week we celebrated SPC Ardmona's marvellous new snack pack line and a new product for SPC, ProVital. This delivers high-quality food for people who have great difficulty, in some cases, even swallowing. SPC ProVital is the first of its kind for the healthcare market, and we want to thank the Victorian government for the $22 million and Coca-Cola Amatil for the $70 million that made this SPCA innovation possible. They, of course, also employ local Shepparton companies like Watters Electrical and SSS Project Management, all helping with that installation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the election, the Abbott government promised to build the 12 replacement submarines in South Australia. Ever since, the government has been twisting and turning, trying to backflip on its pre-election commitment, even after numerous defence experts and credible defence companies have confirmed that the submarines can be built in Australia on time, on price, and to the best world standards. Indeed, it is in Australia's national security and capability interest to build the subs in Australia. For South Australia the contract is vital to the South Australian economy, and to the future of thousands of families and thousands of small business people. It will prevent the loss of skills, and the skills drain that has built up over many years. Where are the South Australian federal Liberals on this issue, when their state needs them most? They are squibbing their responsibility to their state, to the people that elected them and to the people that they represent in this place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  The Berry Celtic Festival, now in its ninth year, is a celebration of all things tartan. Last Saturday was clear and dryâ€”a relief to all the organisers, especially Noel Marshall, and Dorothy and Col Hanbridgeâ€”allowing the historic and specialty vehicles to go onto the Berry Showground. This was after a street parade where we waved to the wee lads, lasses and bairns, listened to the amazing sounds of 10 pipes-and-drum bands and watched the range of tartans march in unison. Thank you, Michael, for driving the Rolls-Royce so professionally.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Gaelic proverb says, 'What the little ones see, the little ones do.' We could see this before our eyesâ€”the young girls in their kilts, capes and tams and the boys in their kilts, shirts and doublets proudly stepping out just like the band members around them. Jock McDougall, one of our local Scotsmen, was Chieftain of the Day. For him this week was huge, as he celebrated both his 85th birthday and his 65th wedding anniversary. He opened the festival with the words 'Cead Mila Failte,' meaning a hundred thousand welcomes. I have to say, as the pipers, drummers and kilt-clad bands marched as a group to the podium, Jock needed less and less support from my arm, and as they came closer still, he sang the tune of the pipes. Being confronted by these bands in the past would have made any army turn and run. They are awe inspiring. </span>

More than $145,000 has been raised and donated. I also thank my Rotary brothers and sisters, not only in Berry but also from Kiama and South Nowra. Their work and assistance always makes this community a great one.</span>

Traffic congestion is a problem that will cost our economy more than $9 billion per year, according to a report by Infrastructure Australia. That report also revealed that the worst and costliest source of congestion occurred on the roads between CityLink and the Eastern Freeway, and on the Eastern Freeway itself. Infrastructure Australia confirms what residents in my electorate of Deakin have known for yearsâ€”that traffic on the Eastern Freeway is getting worse by the day. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These frustrating bottlenecks would have been fixed by the East West Link project, which I have long fought for. Thanks to Dan Andrews, Bill Shorten and the Labor Party, we have missed out on a key opportunity to fix this problem, once and for all. Labor decided that instead of building the infrastructure we so desperately need they would capitulate to the Greens and pay out over $640 million to cancel the East West Link project. I will not give up the fight. The Commonwealth government has confirmed that $3 billion remains available to build the East West Link. So I say to Bill Shorten, 'Get on the phone to Dan Andrews and give him permission to build the East West Link.' This is infrastructure that my electorate of Deakin desperately needs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Sloan was elected to the society for his work in pioneering new ways for engineers to predict the likelihood of the collapse of structures, such as tunnels, dams and highways. His research assists engineers around the world to design safe and cheap essential infrastructure. Close to my home of Newcastle, his methods were applied in the georemediation of the former aluminium smelter site at Kurri Kurri.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:59</span>):  Some in this place forget that most Australians are aspirational. They want to be successful. Nowhere is this more apparent than in agriculture, where I have spent years coaching young leaders on how to achieve their dreams and advance the sector. Jane Worner, a woman from Young in my electorate, is a shining example of the skill set we now have in agriculture. She spent years working in executive management and has returned home to help run the family farm of mixed livestock and grain production across 20,000 acres. She has been awarded a scholarship under the Board Diversity Scholarship Program run by the government and the Australian Institute of Company Directors. Her advice to young farmers is: never stand still. I congratulate Jane for the recognition she has won and for showing other young entrepreneurs not to be afraid of success but, in fact, to embrace it.</span>

That is the difference. We want to encourage people into work. Members opposite want to trap people in welfare because members opposite just hate aspiration.

Yes, at CIBO Espresso in Glenelg, they are going to upgrade their fit-out under our instant asset write-off. At Dolci Sapori in Clayfield in Brisbane, they are going to get a refrigerated van thanks to our instant asset write-off.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the best budget ever for small business. It is the first time in history that any government has backed pro-small-business rhetoric with actual policies specifically designed to give small business a fair go. That is clearly reflected in the surge of confidence right around our country. The ANZ consumer confidence index is up 3.6 per cent. The Westpac index of consumer sentiment is up 6.4 per cent. And why wouldn't they be up?â€”because small business is 96 per cent of all businesses. Small business employs 4Â½ million Australians. Small business is the engine room of our economy. Small business people are the people who mortgage their homes to invest, to employ and to serve their communities. When small business does well, everyone does well. This government understands that, and the test for members opposite will be: how much do they understand that? I suggest that they could help understand it by passing our legislation through the parliament this week.</span>

Even they fear that this particular modelling cannot withstand serious scrutiny. Again, I say to members opposite: from what we can see of this modelling so farâ€”and it is very hard, when they will not actually release it, but from what we can see of this modelling so farâ€”it seems that it does not take into account the impact of people moving from welfare to workâ€”</span>

But the fundamental thing about our childcare changes is that low- and middle-income families using the childcare system will be, on average, $1,500 a year better off. So that is $1,500 a year better off if you work, or work more, and that is exactly what sensible political parties should be trying to doâ€”they should be trying to ensure that the people of Australia make the most of their opportunities and the people of Australia are encouraged to have a go. That is what we want to do. We want the people of Australia to have a go, because we understand that, in the end, that is the best way to ensure that everyone has the fair go that we all yearn for for them.

And the budget has got a good receptionâ€”there is no doubt about thatâ€”right around the country. I have spoken to over 5,000 people in the last couple of weeks, in seven or eight different cities, and, quite clearly, the reception to the budget has been overwhelmingly positive. And why? Because it is a budget that is focused on helping to create jobs, it is a budget that is focused on opportunity, and it is a budget that does not leave anyone behindâ€”in particular, the farmers of Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the honourable member was telling me, he spoke to a Mr Butterfield, Bill Butterfield, who is a farmer from Darke Peak in the Eyre Peninsula. Bill owns and operates Cummins mill, one of the oldest flour mills in Australia. He said: 'The budget measures are fantastic news. On the farm we will purchase water, fencing and a small vehicle, and at the mill we will be looking at a couple of small forklifts. We have had a good rain, and this budget will give us a real lift.' So there it is: Bill Butterfield endorses it, and 11,718 small businesses in the honourable member's electorate would also be endorsing it, because in this budget we are giving small business in Australia the chance to have a go, to invest in their future, whether it be through our tax cutsâ€”a 1Â½ per cent cut in the company tax rateâ€”or up to a five per cent tax discount for businesses that are unincorporated.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition does not understand small business. They had five small business ministers in six years. So when the Leader of the Opposition said the other night that he was going to go for a five per cent company tax discount, he was leaving behind two-thirds of the small businesses in Australia, and even then his own finance spokesman did not back it up 24 hours later.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when we talk about tax cuts for small business, when we talk about accelerated depreciation and when we talk about a fair go for farmers, we actually back it up with real action, not just words. In our situation, what we are focused on is lifting the tide so that all boats rise, and, in particular, any small businessâ€”whether it be unincorporated, a sole trader or a partnership, or be it a companyâ€”with a turnover of less than $2 million has the opportunity to go out there and buy the plant and equipment that is going to expand the business, improve cash flow and, at the end of the day, contribute to more jobs in the economy, because ultimately that is what we are about: more jobs for everyday Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I say to the member who asked the question that this is a government which understands that the best form of welfare is work. This is a government that understands that the best and most generous thing you can do for the people of Australia who are currently doing it tough is to maximise their chances to have a goâ€”to go out and get a job, to go out and get a better job, to work more and to do the right thing by themselves and their family. I cannot understand why members opposite do not get it. Why is it that they seem to prefer people who are trapped in welfare than people who are liberated by work, to do the right thing by themselves, their families and their communities? But when I ponder this question I think the answer does become clearer. Members opposite quite like it when people are trapped in welfare because, if they are trapped in welfare, they are dependent on government. We certainly want government to be there to help. But governments should be there to help; governments should never be the master of the people. </span>

Melbourne is home to the country's only not-for-profit community pharmacy, run by the organisation cohealth, where doctors and pharmacists have worked side by side for decades to give better targeted prescriptions and improve the health of public housing residents and pensioners. Your budget increases funding to private pharmacies but, inexplicably, axes cohealth's pharmacy funding. Why is this budget having a go at some of Melbourne's poorest? And will you review this, given that it will increase the cost to taxpayers of hundreds of thousands of dollars?</span>

The member for Melbourne and I have a meeting to discuss a serious matter, which is the cohealth pharmacy in his electorate. Members might like to know that this is the only pharmacy of its type operating in Australia. There are no other pharmacies that operate under this model and, under cohealth, the PBS does not operate but patients pay a subscription depending on their status and whether it is a family or an individual subscription.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you were to transfer the pharmacy to the PBS, some patients would actually pay less. So it is not a matter of affordability and in designing the transferâ€”and I asked my department what the effect would beâ€”there will actually be a cost to the Commonwealth, not a saving. The ultimate aim for us is to provide affordable medicines in the best possible way. As I understand it, we have given cohealth six months notice and an undertaking to work with them to transition them<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>to the PBS under which, as members would know, concessional patients pay $6.10 per script, up to 60 scripts, and then they receive their medicines for free.</span>

                  </a>  Because I take seriously the pharmacy and its clients and I want to assist it into the future, as I said, I have agreed to meet the member for Melbourne. I do want to make one final point: not all pharmacies operate on a private for-profit principle. In fact, there are many who do not. There are Friendly Society Pharmacies, many in South Australiaâ€”that is, the National Pharmacies chain. They have been operating for over 100 years and they reinvest with member benefits. So let us not make this a private versus public argument, Member for Melbourne. Let us think of the patients and let us concentrate on the affordability of medicines. I look forward to your support for the package of legislation that I will soon introduce, aimed at exactly that.</span>

                  </a>  She, like other members on this side of the House, is aware of the substantial road-funding and rail-funding projects being undertaken by this government in the biggest infrastructure commitment in our history. Of course, that is in very sharp contrast to the Leader of the Opposition, who, in his error-ridden budget speech actually made the assertion that we are cutting funding to roads and rail by 17 per cent. He said we are cutting funding! The biggest road and rail funding project in Australia's history and he says we are cutting it. I suspect he was taking his advice from the shadow minister for transport. But that is not a good idea. After all, he is the leadership contender. You should not be taking his advice and, frankly, it was wrong. Perhaps you should have referred to the budget papers when making that speech. That is where I would expect you would go if you want accurate information about what is happening with road and rail funding. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Budget Paper No. 1, table 15, makes it absolutely clear that road and rail funding are all increasing in these budgets. Road transport expenditure increases from $4.2 billion in 2014-15 to $5.9 billion in 2015-16 and it goes up again in 2016-17 to $8.4 billion, almost double over three years. And the Leader of the Opposition says it is being cut!</span>

Again, the expenditure almost doubled over that period, and the Leader of the Opposition thinks it has been cut. What sort of logic comes from this member? </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable member for Capricornia sees a lot of this work in her own electorate. She sees the work about to commence on the Peak Downs Highway and the new bridges that are going to be built on that road, the Yeppen flood plain, funded and built by this particular government, and tens of millions of dollars on Roads to Recovery and grants to councils in her electorate. This will make a real difference at the local level and nationally. Funding for roads and rail is going up, up, upâ€”not down, as claimed by the Leader of the Opposition.</span>

She is a great advocate for her community. Small business and family enterprise runs through her veins because she knows it is at the heart of her economy. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have travelled around Australia, do you know what the response has been to the small-business budget? It has been fantastic. Everywhere we have travelled the reaction has been, 'What a great budget for small business.' We are happy about that on this side, because what we are trying to do is energise enterprise. This is an historic budget for those enterprising men and womenâ€”the next step in our government's responsible long-term economic plan to build a strong and prosperous economy and, through that, a safer and more secure future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a range of measures in this package that help small business and family enterprises, but at its heart this package is about getting behind those enterprising people and their decisions. We are not coming in telling businesses how they should run their business. We are not even taking money off taxpayers, saying, 'Government knows best.' No, we are not doing that. We are saying to enterprising people, 'You are deploying your resources to grow your businesses in the way that you think is best.' We are providing an incentive, an encouragement, for them to do soâ€”in Dobell and right across our countryâ€”to support investment growth and more employment opportunities. At its heart, it is about turning those entrepreneurial ideas and ambitions into economic action and supporting enterprising people to have a go.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Friday, Prime Minister, I was with our friend the member for Corangamite in Torquay and we met some Tony's tradies. It was fantastic! There was Steve Jewson and his son. They are painters. They said that because of this budget they will invest in new tools and new kit to grow their business. He said as a result of these budget measures it will give him an opportunity to expand the business and therefore employ more people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Isn't that great? Everywhere we go we are seeing a positive and optimistic response to this budget. CommSec said: 'The measures in the federal budget to support small business would have been a key driver in the lifting of confidence.' This is true. This is what we are seeing, and that is what the field evidence is showing us. That is why this package has been so widely welcomed. Measures to cut tax for both small companies and sole traders will also underpin a reboot of confidence for builders, homebuyers and consumers. MYOB CEO Tim Reed said budget night was 'a fantastic night for small business owners', who should be celebrating all around the country. The Business Council of Australia pointed to the support for the economy as a whole. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only thing that stands in its way is Labor. We need no more of this shiftiness, no more game-playing, no more of Labor's blah, blah, blah. Do you know what the small businesses of Australia are saying, Bill? 'Pass the budget measures.'</span>

New NATSEM modelling shows that a single-income working family on $65,000, with two children at school, will be more than $6,000 a year worse off by 2017. So why did the Prime Minister promise before the budget, and I quote, 'We're not going to repair our budget this year at the expense of the family budget'?</span>

I thought to myself: 'Well, this is interesting; NATSEM have done this modelling that was commissioned and paid for by the Labor Party.' It was in all the papers. It was commissioned and paid for by the Labor Party. Naturally enough, with a genuine bout of curiosity, I sought out this NATSEM modelling. I rang a few journalists and said, 'Where is this NATSEM modelling? And I will send someone over to your office to pick up that weighty document.' I would have gone from one end of the country to the other in search of this Labor-Party-funded NATSEM modelling! Do you know what we found? Two pagesâ€”two whole pages that were going to bring down the 2015 budget!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then I thought to myself, 'Hang on; there are some spelling errors in these two pages. There are grammatical errors in the two pages.' So what did we do? We went to the properties of the documentâ€”this NATSEM modelling document that all the media bought, that everyone says is going to bring down the 2015 budget. I said, 'Where did this NATSEM modelling document come from?' The properties indicate the author is Mr Ryan Liddell, Bill Shorten's office. 'Chris from Waramanga'â€”you remember 'Chris from Waramanga'! But hang on: it gets better. Because I have an inquisitive mind, I asked myself, 'Who is this Ryan Liddell?' It turns out that he was Wayne Swan's old press secretary! Watch out, Chris; Swanny's back!</span>

Preventing the radicalisation of young Australians, countering violent extremism and combating terrorism are key priorities for this government. Members are aware of the tragic cases of Australian teenage suicide-bombers Adam Dahman and Jake Bilardi, who were killed senselessly in Syria and Iraq. Disturbingly, there are more like themâ€”vulnerable minors who are being preyed upon by terrorist groups through the internet and social media. The arrests of young people in counter-terrorism operations in Melbourne and earlier arrests in Sydney in February highlight the threat of radicalisation and the danger of home-grown terrorism. Twenty-three people have now been charged in Australia as a result of eight counter-terrorism operations since the terrorist threat was raised to 'high' last September. Teenagers as young as 14, without criminal records, without known links to terrorist networks, are increasingly being duped into planning terrorist attacks; and this is an increasing challenge for our security and law enforcement agencies, as well as for communities and families across Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is not alone in grappling with this issue. Almost all partner countries in our region are facing the challenge of radicalisation and terrorism, which is why it was the focus of our discussions in Seoul last week at a meeting I attended of the MIKTA group, the Mexico, Indonesia, Korea, Turkey and Australia grouping. In fact, South Korea has now identified an 18-year-old national who has joined Daesh in Syria. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government are facing the threat of radicalisation head-on. We have established new offences relating to advocating terrorism. We have addressed urgent operational needs of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies. We have declared no-go zones in al-Raqqa and in Mosul. Over 110 passports of now been cancelled of those posing a security risk to our country. Our $450 million additional funding announced in the budget includes $22 million to undermine online extremist propaganda by shutting down terrorist websites and removing extremist content. Over $1.6 million of funding grants were allocated to 34 community groups across Australia earlier this month for mentoring, education and employment programs to divert vulnerable young people away from violent ideologies. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More must be done. We are building stronger links with partners to share intelligence, knowledge and experience. Next month, Australia will be hosting a major regional summit to enhance the capacity of governments and civil society to reduce the impact of terrorist propaganda and radicalisation, including through engagement with community, industry and religious leaders. The government are committed to preventing the radicalisation of vulnerable young Australians and to keeping our people safe.</span>

                  </a>  I was asked about unfairness and that is exactly what I am talking aboutâ€”the unfairness that members opposite inflicted on the people of Australia and, in particular, the people of Richmond. It was absolutely unfair to saddle the people of Australia with debt and deficit stretching out as far as the eye can see. Intergenerational theftâ€”that was the unfairness that members opposite saddled the people of Australia with. And we are riding to their rescue with a credible path back to surplus which reduces the deficit by a half a percentage point of GDP every year. That is what we are doing. The fairest thing we can do is encourage people to go out there and take the jobs that are available. The fairest thing that we can do is fund with tax incentives the small businesses of our country to create the jobs that are there, as well as making it easier for people to take those jobsâ€”more jobs, and more opportunities to take those jobs. That is the kind of fairness that this government is determined to create. That is the kind of fairness that was destroyed by members opposite when they were in government. That, I fear, is the kind of fairness that members opposite will try to destroy. They cannot help themselves. They will try to destroy the fairness that this government is creating by mindless obstruction in the Senate. This government has a plan for a better Australia where people come closer to realising their potential. And all that members opposite haveâ€”and we see it again and again and again todayâ€”is a long litany of complaint; one long whinge from members opposite is all we get. The Australian people want a political movement with a plan for their futureâ€”a better future for the people of Australiaâ€”and that is exactly what they have got in this government.</span>

This government's primary responsibility will always be to keep the Australian people safe. Since the terror alert level was raised from medium to high in September last year, we have witnessed terrorism events in Sydney and Melbourne and our agencies have protected us from three terrorism events since the beginning of this year alone. Sadly, all the signs are that this threat is going to continue for the foreseeable future. Since September last year, 23 people have been charged as a result of eight counter-terrorism operations. We estimate that around 100 Australians are currently fighting in Syria and Iraq and that another 155 people in Australia are supporting those individuals or groups involved in the Syria and Iraq conflicts. Our agencies are seeing a trend in individuals providing support to terrorist groups, including onshore attack planning both here in Australia and abroad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Syria and Iraq conflicts are now the main theatre of international terrorism. Identifying and investigating Australians who have travelled to these countries and other international conflict zones to engage in these conflicts is a high priority for our counter-terrorism organisations. Overseas conflicts present a very significant challenge for our law enforcement and intelligence communities, as do returning foreign fighters who would seek to do us harm when they return from fighting in those conflicts. Terrorist attack planning is becoming more frequent, the warning times are reducing and, very troublingly, the perpetrators are getting younger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In today's landscape it is more important than ever to ensure that our extensive security and non-security efforts to tackle this menace are well coordinated and effective. Law enforcement at all levels is increasingly dependent on quality, accurate information and intelligence to inform decision making. By making our information sharing stronger we will be able to disrupt these terrorist threats. It is for this reason that the Prime Minister has today announced the appointment of Greg Moriarty as Australia's new coordinator for counter-terrorism to ensure that our security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies continue to work together, as they have done, in a coordinated fashion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must ensure that we remain ahead of the terrorists at all times. It is critical that this government continues to engage across all of our agencies and also, very importantly, with our state and territory partners, who continue to play a vital role in countering terrorism. We want to make sure that we do everything possible to keep the Australian people safe from terrorist attacks at home and also that we work together to prevent Australians from participating in these overseas conflicts. These step show that the Commonwealth will continue to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism arrangements and that we will continue to do everything in our power to keep the Australian people safe from this menace.</span>

It is quite interesting: their union masters are tugging on the strings. And there he is, the ex-union official: he is dancing and dancing and dancing, as the strings get tugged and tugged and tugged. Let me tell the Leader of the Opposition what happened as a result of the MUA-sponsored legislation on coastal shipping that was brought in by the member for Grayndler. Between 2007 and 2013 the number of major Australian ships fell from 30 to 15. Thanks to the member for Grayndler's MUA-inspired coastal shipping legislation, the number of Australian ships halved. And I will tell you what else happened. In the first year of the operation of the member for Grayndler's MUA-inspired legislation, costs increased by 63 per cent. That is what happened.</span>

                  </a>  It is clear. I think what has really happened here is that the member for Grayndler has set up the Leader of the Opposition. That is what has happened here. The people's choice has set up the union's choice; that is what has happened. And of course the union's choice is always happy to ask a question that he thinks the MUA wants. Well, again, let me say that as a result of the MUA legislation that was brought in by the member for Grayndler, with the support of the Leader of the Opposition, coastal shipping costs rose by 63 per centâ€”a 63 per cent increase in the cost of coastal shipping, a halving of the number of Australian ships involved in coastal shipping. Because these people opposite are in thrall to the union movement, they have destroyed jobs in shippingâ€”</span>

But the good news is that this government has a plan to fix it, unlike the opposition. Through our Students First policy initiatives we are going to declutter the national curriculum to give teachers more time to teach maths. We are going to reform teacher training in order to have more of an emphasis on mathematics and only graduate specialists in maths, science and languages in primary school teachers. We are going to increase school autonomy to give principals the opportunity to get the teachers they need rather than the teachers they are sent.</span>

                  </a>  'Hear, hear!' the poor old hapless member for Moreton calls outâ€”the exact same policy that Labor themselves abolished in 2011-12, with the then Minister for Higher Education, Chris Evans, saying that students are predominantly motivated not by price but by their interests, abilities and career preferences. He was exactly right. Labor abolished the exact same policy that the Leader of the Opposition wants to bring back, because it was not working but was costing a tremendous amount of money. The policy was so badly handled in the Leader of the Opposition's address in reply about the budget that on the night of the budget response he said it would cost $353 million and by the next morning it was $45 million. So, on May 15 it was $353 million, the next morning it was $45 million and by the afternoon it was $1.4 billion. He had more numbers than the Eurovision Song Contest! I could just imagine Bill there with a microphone falling down from the ceiling and a long cord, singing a few numbers about his mathematical prowessâ€”353 million, 45 million and 1.4 billion, in the space of less than 24 hours. No wonder focus groups say this man has no substance. When the government had the policy costed, it was $2.25 billion. The Leader of the Opposition has no credibility when it comes to education policy. Is it any wonder the public are not taking this man seriously?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:51</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister for the opportunity to comment on the opposition's modelling and the questions of modelling. On this side of the House we have brought down a budget that does something very important for Australian families. That is, it gives them the choice to be in work. What those opposite do, when the Leader of the Opposition's office is doing modelling, we have learnt today, is look at only one thing: they look at welfare. They do not look at work. They do not understand that, for families to want to be in work, they need choice. They need the choices that are provided through our Jobs for Families package. That is what we are providing. They need the choices that are provided by the $5.5 billion that is being invested in the jobs and small business packages. They are going to unleash the choices of small business to provide the jobs that those families want.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr FRYDENBERG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:56</span>):  I thank the member for Boothby for his question and acknowledge his strong contribution to protecting the retirement savings of all Australians. The coalition is the best friend of superannuation Australians have ever had. This is because we have championed self-managed super funds. This is because we continue to support an increase in the super guarantee, even though those opposite refuse to fund it. This is because we, in this year's budget and in this term of government, have committed to making no unexpected or adverse changes to superannuation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am asked if I am aware of any alternatives. I am aware of at least four alternativesâ€”and all of them sit opposite. The first was the former member for Griffith Kevin Rudd, who said on the eve of the 2007 election, 'We will not change superannuation one jot, one tittle.' Secondly, I am aware of the records of the Rudd and Gillard governments where they made at least 12 adverse changes to superannuation and increased taxation by at least $9 billion on super. Thirdly, I am aware of that famous press release from the member for McMahon, the professor of ouzo economics, titled 'Five-year freeze on superannuation changes'. That commitment lasted less than 48 hours. Then of course I am aware of the fourth alternative from the Leader of the Opposition, the man who called superannuation a 'legalised tax haven'. He announced on 22 April this year that he was going to increase two taxes on superannuation. But that is starting to unravel before his very eyes. He has been caught out by the Parliamentary Budget Office. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> on 21 May stated that the Parliamentary Budget Office reportedly advised that Labor's two taxes on super will adversely impact on 425,000 Australiansâ€”more than three times the number that Labor claimed in their press release.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then when it comes to the revenue grab that Labor claims it is getting from its tax increases, the Parliamentary Budget Office said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">These costings are considered to be of low reliability â€¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party has a $58.6 billion budget black hole, and the Leader of the Opposition is in a desperate cash grab. All of this is from a Leader of the Opposition who said on Radio National with Fran Kelly: 'I've spent my whole working life to make sure ordinary Australians have more money when they retire.' This is hollow comfort for the more than 400,000 Australians who will be adversely hit by this latestâ€”but it will not be the lastâ€”Labor raid on super.</span>

It was from Chris Bowen. They are all writing books over there. Even the member for Lilley is getting the Parliamentary Library to write his second book! It is a good book, you should read it. It is very good! I would say to the honourable member for McMahon that the coalition believes not just in words but in actions. We should deliver certainty and stability in superannuation. The Labor Party not only wants to introduce new taxes on people's superannuation but wants to keep changing the rules. I would ask him to go back to his own book, look at his own words and reflect on his own wisdom at that point.</span>

He is a great advocate for Tasmania. He is a very strong voice in this place and I know that he is very concerned about making sure that we protect our Southern Ocean. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service has an amazing job. They protect our borders and they are now protecting our waters. This 42-day venture was made possible because we have been able to stop the boats in north of Australia. We have been able to turn boats around where it is safe to do so. We have been able to deal with the mess that Labor left us when they left government only 18 months or so ago.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been able to apply some of these assets to have a look at some of the difficulties in the Southern Ocean. A 42-day venture is a long venture. I want to thank the crew very much for the work that they have been doing. They have traversed 6,000 kilometres of the Southern Ocean and they have been able to target those people who would seek to fish legally within our waters and to make sure that they can address all of those concerns that Australian fishermen and ventures have in relation to illegal ventures coming to our waters. As I say, this is only possible because we have been able to turn around what was a disastrous policy under Labor. It is worth noting that whilst the Labor Party has criticised us for this venture, it is the case that this is the first venture since 2012. That is because 2012 was the peak of activity on the waters between Indonesia and our country. In actual fact, the Australian public understand this issue well, because 52,000 people came on 821 boats when Labor was in power.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have recognised in the last few days that the Leader of the Opposition has had every position but a positive one in relation to turning around boats when it is safe to do so. Let me make this very safe prediction that if Labor is elected at the next election and Bill Shorten becomes Prime Minister, then the people smugglers will be back in business. They will be back in business and we would not be allowing the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ocean Shield</span> to head south to stop the illegal fishers, because all of our activities and all of our efforts would be applied to the north of our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you that when you see the Leader of the Opposition in action, you understand why Labor is a disaster when it comes to boats. If you do not turn those boats around when it is safe to do so, those boats will restart, the deaths at sea will recommence and detention centres in this country will refill. We have been able to close down 13 of Labor's detention centres, we have stopped those deaths at sea and we have got our border protection back under control.</span>

Before the election, the Prime Minister promised not to make any adverse changes to superannuation. Since the election, the Prime Minister has twice frozen the superannuation guarantee and has increased superannuation taxes on low-income earners. These measures that will cost Australians over $900 billion in retirement savings over the next 40 years. Why is the Prime Minister cutting to superannuation future of low- and middle-income Australians?</span>

We know that he wants to hit people with a superannuation tax. We know what he plans because we know what he was like.

Let me go on, this government has no plans to change the taxation of superannuation in the future beyond this term of parliament and this government will never treat the savings of Australians as a piggybank to be raided by the government whenever the government is in trouble. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand that superannuation is not the government's money, it is the people's moneyâ€”that is why we are not going to touch it. We respect the fact that the people of Australia work hard and when they put money away for their retirement it belongs to themâ€”it is not an emergency fund for a government that was running out of money the way members opposite were when they were in government. We absolutely respect that there is a world of difference between the social security that the government provides to people and people's own savings. We understand that difference, members opposite do not. They just do not get it. They think that your money belongs to them when they are in trouble. This is a very clear distinction between the Labor Party and the coalition on this point. And I make it absolutely crystal clear what will happen if members opposite were re-electedâ€”the carbon tax comes back, a superannuation tax comes on and the boats start again. That is what will happen. On that note, I ask that further questions be placed on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  I spoke before question time about the budget's impacts on Canberra and I now turn to the broader impact on the budget. In the last sittings, the shadow Treasurer gave a speech in which he said that the Prime Minister got to the so-called budget emergency, kicked the tyres on the fire truck and then drove off. Subsequently, the shadow minister for finance has said that he likes the shadow Treasurer but on this one he thinks he is wrong. He thinks when the Prime Minister arrived he threw a Molotov cocktail, crashed the fire truck and then gave a press conference to blame Labor. I like the shadow minister for finance but on this one I think he is wrong. I think in the case of the so-called budget emergency the Prime Minister drove the fire truck over the neighbour's cat, started a back-burning operation that went out of control and then decided he had to save the mansions but leave the weatherboard homes to go up in smoke. On the way, he stopped to give the order of the garter to a favourite koala and then gave a press conference to blame the trees for burning down. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government said that the core test of economic management was to get debt and deficits under control. It is clear that most economists would not rate that as the core test of economic management. Indeed, there were a number of senior economists during the last term of government that criticised Labor for focusing on budget balance rather than on other issues. But this was the test that the government set itself from opposition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government said very clearly that it believed that the core test of economic responsibility was a government's ability to run a balanced budget. They nominated Peter Costello as their epitome of fiscal credibility because he, through a series of budgets, was mostly able to deliver surpluses. But he was only able to deliver those surpluses through the sale of public assets and in part because of the government revenue windfall generated by mining boom mark 1. Most economists would not regard Peter Costello as the greatest Treasurer we have ever had. Indeed in his new book Ross Gittins compares the legacies of the various Australian treasurers of his timeâ€”and he ranks Peter Costello pretty low. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if one does take running a balanced budget as the test of fiscal success, it is very clear that the government have failed. In opposition said they would deliver a surplus in their first year of government and in every subsequent year. How have they gone on that test? Upon coming to office, the Treasurer moved quickly to bring down a budget updateâ€”a budget update that doubled the deficit through things such as giving a $1.1 billion tax break back to multinationals and giving the Reserve Bank $9 billion that they had not even asked for. This year's budget yet again doubles the deficitâ€”and that is a doubling of the deficit not relative to the Treasury and Finance numbers in the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook but a doubling of the deficit based on the government's own numbers. If we compare last year's budget with this year's budget, the deficit has gone from $17 billion up to $35 billion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of debt and deficits, it is now clear, according to respected economist Saul Eslake, that the net impact of policy decisions by this government has been an addition of $8 billion to the deficit. He estimates that policy decisions in this year's budget worsened the budget bottom line by a total of $8.2 billion and that policy decisions in last year's budget had had a significant impact on the budget bottom line as well. Mr Eslake notes that the government claims to have offset all of their initiatives, but he then inquires how that could be the case. At a recent budget panel session in the Parliament House theatrette at which we both spoke, he explained how the government was able to make that claim. The government is only able to claim they have offset all their initiatives because in their first budget they announced an unfair paid parental leave scheme and put the money for it in the contingency reserve and then this year decided not to proceed with that bad policyâ€”and then counted their failure to go ahead with that unfair scheme as a saving! Why didn't we think  of that? Why didn't we think of announcing a bad policy, not implementing it and thenâ€”after deciding not to implement itâ€”counting the money as a saving? It is fiscal genius! If you discount that interesting piece of accounting, it is very clear that the government is failing to offset its decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a further trick in the budget papers: earnings from the Future Fund are counted towards the surplus. As Saul Eslake points out, more than half the projected surpluses from 2025 arise out of this accounting trick. Saul Eslake noted, in the budget forum at which we both spoke, that he was raising the issue hesitantlyâ€”because, as he put it:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the last time I was critical of a government for the way it accounted for things in the budget the then treasurer, Peter Costello, rang up the chief executive of the bank I was working for, John McFarlane, and said that he would take regulatory action that ANZ did not like if I repeated those kinds of criticisms â€¦ I don't think Joe Hockey is as glass-jawed as Peter Costello is, so I'm not really worried about that in this context.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He added:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ you might have thought that it would have been disclosed more obviously than in a footnote to a chart â€¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget also includes a $5 billion development fund for the north of Australia. These resources will go, according to the government, to 'those who are unable to access finance at a reasonable cost'. Five billion dollars is a large sum of money in anyone's language. You might therefore have expected that, if a government were announcing a $5 billion fund, they would provide some detail about how that fund would operate. Seeking to discover how the fund will operate, however, respected journalist Laura Tingle contacted the infrastructure minister's office and was told that the minister's office 'had no details on the scheme'. The minister is sitting at the table here and would perhaps like to add some detail about how this $5 billion fund is going to work. I would welcome him doing so at some point in this debate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All the Treasurer's office have said is that the facility is 'aimed at economic infrastructure that will increase the productive capacity of Northern Australia', and they reiterated that the funding will go to projects unable to access finance at a reasonable cost. But they also said that, broadly speaking, the fund would target projects that had the ability to generate a return. So these will be projects not funded by banks but nonetheless able to generate a return for the taxpayer. Perhaps a careful analysis of such projects exists, but any such analysis has so far unfortunately been unable to find its way into the public domain. This would perhaps be less important were we not talking about a $5 billion fund. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this budget does is effectively shift a range of budgetary challenges onto the states. The states have spoken out very clearly about their concerns, particularly about the $80 billion in cuts to health and education. Not only Labor premiers but conservative premiersâ€”Mike Baird, for instanceâ€”are deeply concerned about the impact this will have on their budgets. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke before question time briefly about the impact on inequality. We have new modelling from NATSEM, the Prime Minister's modeller of choice, showing that the poorest 20 per cent of households with children will lose up to seven per cent of their total annual disposable income in 2018-19, but households with children in the top 20 per cent will see their disposable incomes increase very slightly, by 0.2 per cent, by 2018-19. We know, according this new modelling, taking into account last year's budget and this year's budget, that nine in 10 low-income households are worse off as a result of these budgets and nine in 10 high-income households are left better off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not just a budget which is bad for inequality, now at a 75-year high in Australia after a generation in which earnings had risen three times as fast for the top 10th of wage earners as for the bottom 10th of wage earners. It is also a budget which fails to make investments in innovation. We know that, as Australia transitions from the investment phase of the mining boom to the production phase of the mining boom, we need to ask the question about where the jobs of the future will come from. That is why the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply focused on getting more scientists, more technology workers, more engineers and more mathematicians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we provide all Australian students with the opportunity to code. Some people may regard coding as a skill which can only be learnt at university. I certainly, as an empirical economist, did my share of coding using programs such as Stata, but I have also enjoyed the new apps available to teach coding to kids. My five-year-old enjoys Daisy the Dinosaur, an app which I would strongly recommend to any parents listening. It is fundamental in teaching the rudiments of coding, loops and the sequencing of instructions to children. Coding is just one skill that we will need to lay the foundations for future prosperity. It was a pleasure for me to join Senator Sinodinos and Brian Schmidt at a forum organised in 2012 at Government House, talking about innovation and entrepreneurship. This is the sort of conversation which Labor has sparked and which we continue. There is the iAccelerate facility at the University of Wollongong, which I visited last week. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="PK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RANDALL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  It is my pleasure today to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2015-2016 and cognate bills. Before I go to what I intend to mainly speak about today, I make the initial observation that this budget has gone down rather well in the electorate of Canning, from what I can ascertain from the phone calls and emails I have received, and so it should. It makes sure it restores a lot of confidence back into the electorate in relation to business, families and small business. It has been well accepted. It has taken away a lot of the hostility that would seem to have been generated from the initial budget. I make another observation: I wish I could be paid the same amount of money as Glenn Stevens for the job that seems to be done on behalf of the Reserve Bank of Australia. It appears that fiscal policy in this country for a long time has been run on the fact that you either have interest rates up or have interest rates down. If the big decision every month is whether interest rates go up or down, that is not a hard decision if that is how you are basing the fiscal policy of this country and how you manage your job at the Reserve Bank of Australia. I would like to see a bit more imagination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I wish to speak about an issue in my electorate as part of the appropriation bills. Constituents of mine, ever since I was elected the member for Canning in 2001, come to me time after time. The issue is the Western Australian environmental offsets policy. This policy works in theory to limit the negative impact of the development and the clearing of native vegetation on the environment by purchasing alternate land or making financial contributions to science and/or strategy. However, in practice I have found the policy is uncoordinated and lacks value for money when it comes to the purchase of the offset lands. Time and againâ€”and I shall outline some specific examples further onâ€”this policy has appeared to me and my constituents of Canning to be a policy that forces developers and others to buy offsets for just the sake of buying offsets rather than effecting any actual restorative environmental enhancement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the benefit of the House, I would now like to take a moment to briefly explain what an offset is. An offset is an action or a set of actions undertaken to address significant impact that a development or activity, such as the clearing of native vegetation, may have on the local environment. This is done off-site. There are two types of offsets: direct offsets which involve on-ground action such as rehabilitation, restoration, revegetation and conservation; and indirect offsets which are actions taken to improve scientific knowledge and community understanding about the impact a project can have on the environment, so that any future projects can draw upon this knowledge. It is important to note that indirect offsets also include contributing to state government initiatives, policies or strategic funds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to note that it is stated in the Western Australian government's environmental offsets policy that 'environmental offsets will only be considered after avoidance and mitigation options have been pursued.' My first concern with the Western Australian offsets policy is the suggestion under principle 4: 'for example, offsets could include actions that complement strategic conservation plans prepared by government et cetera, such as Bush Forever.' I acknowledge that the current WA government is not responsible for the implementation of the Bush Forever program. I will pause at this point to say that it was a former Liberal minister, Graham Kierath, who initiated the Bush Forever program, and I might add that the program was noble in trying to retain remnant urban bushland, but it had no compensation aspect to it. It was draconian in its application. But I do find it incredulous that any contribution such as a slapdash attempt at conservation would be included in this current policy of offsets, and this is what it refers to. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bush Forever has been a major problem for my constituents for a long period of time. As federal member for Canning, I have had countless meetings with constituents about the implementation of this program since 2001. In fact, as the member for Swan from 1996 to 1998, I also had people coming to me about it. For most of these people, Bush Forever equates to financial ruin. This draconian piece of policy allowed the then government of the day to come along and seize chunks of people's land or mandate their existence because they were deemed to be environmentally sensitive, and therefore declare the land as protected under Bush Forever. This then leaves the landowner to maintain a parcel of land they cannot utilise. Not only can they not use it; they have to maintain it and make sure that it is looked after and fenced off and that predators and pests et cetera are kept away from it, at their own expense. The land is significantly devalued when the fed-up landowners decide to sell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just two weeks ago I was contacted by a constituent with a complaint about the use of aerial photographs to establish a Bush Forever site on his property in Forrestdale some 11 years ago. In this instance, the use of aerial photographs led to the plantings line being drawn through my constituent's pool and patio, rather than following the natural wetland boundary on the property. I would like to note that it has so far taken my constituent 11 years to have this situation rectified, and still he does not have a satisfactory resolution. He is desperate to sell and downsize now that he has retired, but the current mistake means that his property is worth at least $50,000 less than it should be. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example of the poor implementation of the Bush Forever policy has been experienced by my constituents Stephen and Margaret Day. My constituents bought their 12-acre property in 1999, two years before the Bush Forever policy came into effect. As part of their garden, the Days planted some bougainvilleas and she-oaksâ€”plants that were later claimed to be natives and were used as a basis to implement a Bush Forever site on seven of the Days' 12 acres! And, as if this is not bad enough, the Days were told that they were unable to clear the Bush Forever land, despite warnings from local firefighters, who had been to the property on three prior occasions to  fight fires, that it was a risk to their safety. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In similar instances, because these sites are either not maintained or are unable to be manipulated, they have become a habitat for exotic/non-native species of plants that ultimately render the program's main objective futile. For the state government to then suggest in their policy guidelines that offsets could contribute to such an impractical program as Bush Forever is clear evidence that they have learned very little about the practical application of environmental conservation policies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example of what I can only call a nonsensical approach to environmental offsets relates to the purchase of offset lands far away from where the clearing or development is taking place. I refer to the now one-stop shop program which has been implemented by our Minister for the Environment, Greg Hunt, and state environment ministers, which has resulted in duplication and overlap between the Commonwealth and state jurisdictions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have previously risen in parliament to speak on behalf of the Tuckey familyâ€”a well-established family in Mandurahâ€”and their problems with offset purchases. To recap, the Tuckeys own a significant portion of land, referred to as Tuckey Cove, which they develop for residential purposes by way of subdivision. During the process of developing a portion of this land and seeking the relevant environmental approvals, the Tuckeys were informed that they would need to purchase offset land to mitigate the possible destruction of habitat for local cockatoo species, including the Forest red-tailed cockatoo, and Baudin's and Carnaby's cockatoos. After consultation with the department, the Tuckeys were advised that they would need to purchase offset lands in Gingin, located some 200 kilometres from Mandurah. What relevance this has to offsets for the local bird population, goodness only knows. That shows what happens when an environment department in Canberra, 3,000 kilometres away from Western Australia, decides to make orders like this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I make no argument against the need to preserve the environment, especially those areas that are inhabited by endangered species, such as the aforementioned cockatoos. I do, however, take umbrage with the fact that, in this particular instance, the Tuckeys were forced to purchase lands far away from the potential habitat of the cockatoos they were meant to be affecting. I know that the bureaucrats in the state government will argue that not all offsets can be like-for-like and that in some instances exceptions need to be made. But this is happening all the time. It is not just a one-off. When you couple this decision with the fact that the Tuckeys were told that their $50,000 contribution to the Gingin project was insufficientâ€”they ended up paying $100,000â€”for a one-hectare development, it certainly raises some questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have other constituents who have been affected by this, such as NLG Sand, who were forced to pay tens of thousands of dollars to establish whether there were cockatoo habitats around their sand pitâ€”there were not any. The Dawesville Catholic Primary School, which wanted to expand their school oval, were told they would have to buy offsets for the cockatoos. In Mandurah, a shopping centre development that wanted to put in a Coles store had to buy offset land in the wheat belt in Western Australia, with little or no relevance to their location.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An alternative arrangement would be for developers such as the Tuckeys and others to make monetary contributions to a designated fund to purchase environmentally sensitive land in the region. In other words, rather than having little bits of money here and there buying offsets all over the place, it would be sensible to have one large coordinated fund to buy large sensitive environmentally affected areas. This has been proposed by Minister Greg Hunt, and he tells me that state environment minister Jacobs supports such a pooled fund. One example of such a purchase is that part of the Yalgorup Lake system to the west of Lake Clifton in my electorate which is currently on the market. The Sarich landâ€”Sarich of the orbital engineâ€”could be used for conservation or recreation purposes if it were bought for this purpose. It is something like 1,000 hectares that cannot be used for anything but being retained in public ownership. But it is currently in private ownership and it cannot be developed. FRAGYLE, or the Friends of Ramsar Action Group for the Yalgorup Lakes Environment Inc., have been trying to persuade the state government to buy this land in order to maintain the local environment. The state government, however, has been unable to reach an agreeable price with the seller and the land is still for sale. It has come down from something like $30 million to $10 millionâ€”it is an absolute bargain, and the state government might want to get involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that under the policy guidelines there is scope for such a fund; however, I note that such a fund for Peel has not come into consideration at this stage. The Peel region is one of the fastest growing regions in Western Australia and, according to the Peel Development Commission, is set to rival the South West as the state's most populous region outside of the metro area. In light of the development occurring in this region and its environmentally significant areas, such as the Peel-Harvey catchment, we certainly encourage the consideration of the establishment of a fund to which offset payments for projects in the Peel region can be made. It is my understanding that such a scheme exists in a number of places around the country. Perhaps the most notable of these is the Reef Trust Investment Strategy, which allows developers who impact upon the Great Barrier Reef to pool offset moneys into a fund to target these impacts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to conclude with a quintessential example of the state government's incompetence when it comes to environmental policies. Many of you will be familiar with the case of Peter Swift, a farmer from my electorate who bought a piece of land and was subsequently prosecuted by the then Department of Environmental Conservation for clearing native vegetation on this property without a permit. As it turns out, Mr Swift was able to prove his innocence with the use of aerial photographs, which clearly demonstrated that the clearing had been undertaken by the previous owner. Even though he was proved innocent, Mr Swift was told that a significant portion of his landâ€”310 of his 465 acresâ€”could not be used for farming, as per Mr Swift's original intention. Once again, I find myself confronted with a constituent who has been chewed up and spat out by the state government and by the DEC and left with land that can neither be used nor sold due to its loss of value. Mr Swift has been left financially destitute and now faces foreclosure because he cannot afford to pay his loans, which were incurred through the legal fees he has had to pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the state government doing about its mistake, you might ask? Mr Swift is asking for an ex gratia payment. I hope that he gets that ex gratia payment because he did nothing wrong and he has been exonerated by the courts. The WA government needs to take seriously the issues of land tenure, land usage and the preservation of environmentally sensitive lands whilst giving serious protection and financial security for the owners of land that is privately owned. To that end, I conclude my statement to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="00AMR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:40</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Appropriation Bills, which represent the Abbott government's second budget What is now too painfully clear is that the Abbott government's second budget is not a budget for Australia's future. It is not a budget that invests in the health of the nation; it is not a budget that deals with the very real challenges that we as a country have. It is a short-sighted attempt to do one thing and one thing onlyâ€”to save the Prime Minister's jobâ€”and nowhere is that more painfully clear than when it comes to health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Frankly, given the absolute disaster that occurred last year, I could not comprehend how this year's budget could do more damage. Last year's budget, it is worth recalling, ripped $57 billion out of public hospital fundingâ€”costs that have now been simply transferred to states and territories. It gutted preventative health programs, attempted to destroy Medicare by forcing all Australians, even pensioners and children, to pay a tax every time they visit the doctor That budget also included cuts to adult dental programs and an increase in the price patients pay to access medicines, as well as changes to both the MBS and PBS safety nets that make it harder and harder for patients to reach. It was a budget that was so disastrous for health care and healthcare reform that it led to its minister being voted the worst health minister in 40 years and, before that year was out, he was gone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, I suspect, like everyone who cares about health care in this country, our hopes that the government had learnt its lesson on health have not been realised with this budget. Far from attempting to make at least a start in repairing last year's debacle, the Abbott government's second budget not only entrenches last year's cuts, but it adds a couple of billion dollars more just for good measure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Prime Minister, it seems, too many health cuts are just never enough. Not happy with having slashed over $57 billion out of health last year, he has come back for another $2 billion this year. Still entrenched in this budget is a GP tax and the hikes in the price of medicines. Last week there was a farcical attempt by the minister to abandon those cuts, before the Treasurer forced her into an embarrassing backdown. Had her comments been left to stand, the fraud of including the cuts in the bottom line of budget would lay exposed. Now, many of these cuts are not as obvious as the GP tax or the cuts to hospitals and, as a result, many of them have not received much scrutiny yet particularly from members opposite, who, it is clear, do not understand just what their own government is up to or the impact this will have on their communities in coming months. But make no mistake, this budget will have just as damaging an impact on the health system as last year's, and once again it is real peopleâ€”patients, doctors and nursesâ€”who will be the victims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, I am going to use my time in this debate to go through some of those cuts. Of course, the budget locks in the $57 billion in cuts to public hospitals from last year's budget. Despite going to the election promising that the coalition would fund 50 per cent growth of the National Efficient Price, the Prime Minister has broken that promise and has instead entrenched growth in hospital funding on a formula based only on population growth and the CPI, which will not meet the demand for hospitals into the future. State premiers and chief ministers have called this for what it is: a complete broken promise and the lowest level of funding since the Commonwealth first started funding public hospitals after the Second World War. These are cuts that the New South Wales Liberal Premier Mike Baird has described as unsustainable. He stated that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The states do not have the capacity to meet those health costs on their own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The AMA's most recent report card found public hospitals are already not keeping pace with population growth and demand; as a result of this, the government's budget cuts are facing a future funding crisis. As the Victorian health minister, Jill Hennessy, stated: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Tony Abbott's cuts will see sick Victorian patients wait longer for treatment. It's that simple.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Federal Government needs to play its part and contribute its fair share so Victorians can get the treatment they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite simply, these cuts cannot be sustained, and the government knows it. The cuts will have a seriously detrimental impact on emergency department waiting times and elective surgery waiting times. They will increase waiting times, and they will put lives at risk, make no mistake about it. What is even more damaging is thatâ€”after years of positive engagement by clinicians through states, territories and the Commonwealthâ€”this government has completely walked away from any public hospital reform whatsoever, putting the reform process back years and giving up any hope of actually realising efficiencies across the public hospital system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then in this budget, of course, we saw that there was even worse to come. In this budget we have had more than $125 million cut from the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. Could there be any decision more petty and nasty than to cut funding from kids' dental? Well, there actually could, and I will talk about that a bit later. This is a scheme that provides up to $1,000 over two years for eligible kids aged between two and 17 years. In government, Labor recognised the importance of good dental health for a person's overall health, especially for children, which is why we introduced this program. We also invested more than $650 million in public dental programs for adults in order to reduce waiting lists. But this government has already cut more than $50 million in public dental programs; it is now cutting more than $125 million in children's dental benefits in this budget, and cumulatively cutting more than $500 million when taking into account the cuts in its last budget. A few days before this announcement, the minister was boasting of how, as she put it, the government had got its teeth into dental health. It turns out that the only thing the government has got its teeth into is, again, patients. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cuts to children's health do not stop there. This budget also includes a cut of $145 million from the Healthy Kids Check. This means that parents will no longer have access to one-hour appointments with GPs for these checks, which we know have been invaluable in the early detection of asthma, hearing and speech issues, as well as other developmental issues. This is a short-sighted and callous move from a government that is demonstrating it has no commitment to universal health care. It is a cut to an important children's health program, which goes to demonstrate that this government does not believe in a universal health insurance scheme and simply does not believe in Medicare. This is a cut that will have an impact on patient access, particularly to speech pathology, and it is a cut that Labor condemns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not content with cutting $197 million from the flexible funding pool last year, this year's budget also slashes a further $500 million from the funds which support so many vital community health and support organisations. We think the figure is $500 million; that is the media report. We suspect that it might be a bit more. The new measure 'rationalising and streamlining health programs'â€”read 'cut' in this government's languageâ€”includes a cut of more than $500 million from all the groups in every part of the nation that do so much to help in areas like drug and alcohol rehabilitation; mental health services; Aboriginal health organisations, particularly those working in chronic disease; and vital non-government organisations working across the entire health sector, including the Consumer's Health Forum, Alzheimer's Australia, the Heart Foundation and the Public Health Association of Australia. Name a health organisation in this country, and they, generally, are the recipient of flexible funds. That is the program that has been cut. It was no exaggeration on budget night when the Public Health Association described this as a bloodbath for those organisations. This will reach into the heart of every electorate in every state and territory, and rip away the local services that are the very fabric of these local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Which brings me to another measure, which is still sitting within the budget from last year, the unfair increase to the PBS co-paymentsâ€”increasing the cost of medicine by $5 for every general script and 80c for every concessional script before the safety net is reached. Not content with stopping there, the government also wants to increase the safety net by two scripts per year for concessional patientsâ€”that is, pensioners, people with a disability and others who are already doing it toughâ€”as well as increase the safety net by 10 per cent per year for all general patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even for a government which is famous for its chaotic and ham-fisted approach to health, the minister managed last week to set a new benchmark for bizarre health policy announcements, by unilaterally announcing just nine days after the budget that she was no longer pursuing this, because she had suddenly somehow discovered she could not get it through the Senate. That makes a complete fraud of why it is in the budget in the first place but, leaving that aside, this was despite the government knowing for almost a year that it does not have the support of the Senate to get this measure through. But nine days later, the minister announced that she had given up on it and, in the process, blown a $1.3 billion hole in the Treasurer's budget. This backdown lasted less than a day, before Joe Hockey was on morning TV making it clear to the minister that, in the Abbott government, budget cuts come first and health policy a very distant second, and that the PBS hikes and safety increases were well and truly back on the table. That is, of course, unless the minister can find another $1.3 billion of cuts in health, having already cut it to the bone. What an absolute debacle, but what insight it provides into the government's thinking on health policy: no evidence, no planning and no idea of what might constitute decent health policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The health system and indeed all Australians deserve a lot better than that. It is worth mentioning that this $1.3 billion measure is still in the books as being part of the Medical Research Future Fund. That fund was supposed to start on 1 January, but that has not occurred. The government knows the increase to the costs of medicines does not have the support of the Senate. It has not even been bothered to introduce it in the Senate, because it knows that it does not have that support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, still within the budget is the freeze to the MBS schedule: a $1.3 billion freeze. We have had a $7 GP tax, a $5 GP tax and a $20 GP tax, and now are being told that, somehow, there is nothing further to come in relation to this. Well, that freeze is still within the budget. It has already seen GPs change their billing practices across the country, it has seen a reduction in bulk-billing and it still sits within the budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You have to say that this government has hit an all-time low with some of the other measures that are here in that $2 billion worth of cuts. There is one cut that I particularly want to mention, and it is extraordinary in its pettiness. There is a very small program for about 900 patients in this country who have the disease PKU. Babies are tested for it at birth. As I said, there are 900 of these patients. It is a rare genetic condition. However, if these babies do not receive a specialised diet from start, they will develop brain damage. They have to have this diet. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a long time now the federal government has been providing a subsidy, a very small amount of moneyâ€”$250 per month, about $3,000 per yearâ€”to these 900 families to enable them to purchase the food for their children so they do not develop brain damage. The government has cut the program in the budget. This is such a pathetic and small-minded measure. This is a very small cohort of patients with a very rare disease. They are absolutely reliant on this specialised diet. There are three providers of this special food in the country. It is incredibly expensive. Things like a specialised loaf of bread costs $10. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These families are not rich families who are able, somehow or other, to find $10 for a loaf of bread. As we know, for most households with kids, a loaf of bread does not last very long either. They received a letter the day after the budget with basically no warning and no consultation with any of the peak organisations that represent these families and this small cohort of patients. Bang! It is gone! That is the level to which this government is prepared to stoop. Those kids desperately need to have this food subsidised, because it is not replaceable. You cannot just walk into a shop and get a piece of food and know that it will have the right measure of protein for your child, given the damage that it does. These families already struggle. This has been a very small-minded measure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other measures in the budget which has not received a lot of attention is the scrapping of the GP after-hours access line. It receives some 200,000 calls. These are calls that have been referred from a nurse on-call line. People call that line; the nurse says that the case may be a bit more complicated and they need to talk to a general practitioner. There was no cost-benefit analysis of the program. It took a long time to set up and negotiate with states and territories. On 1 Julyâ€”bang, scrapped, gone! We have had representations from some of the GPs who have been running that line. It has been servicing many patients who do not have access to regular GPs. They are mental health patients, refugees, rural and regional Australians who have trouble with access. Again, this is a really small-minded decision from an incredibly small-minded government when it comes to health. It is no wonder, when the government does not have any health policy and when it does not have any plans for the future of this nation, that you see this sort of decision making in the budget.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SCOTT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:55</span>):  It is wonderful to be here today to talk about Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2015-2016 and related bills. Following on from the previous speaker, I will be outlining the plans that we, the coalition, have for the future. It is wonderful to have here in the chamber my good friend the member for Mayo, who has been strategising these great plans to get Western Sydney moving againâ€”for example, the $50 billion infrastructure package that will create so many jobs for the people of Western Sydney. But I guess for those opposite jobs are not that important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is wonderful to be part of a government that is building a stronger Australia. The 2015 budget is the very next step to ensure the long-term economic growth to build a stronger, safer and more prosperous future for all Australians. I probably do not need to remind all of us in the House of the legacy of those opposite: the $667 billion gross debt that is projected to rise. But I like to look at the positive side. In the words of Winston Churchill: 'Difficulties mastered are opportunities won.' To grow our economy, we must grow jobs; to create jobs, we must look to the sectors and find the opportunity. I agree with Professor Michael Porter: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Innovation is the central issue to economic prosperity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can look right across the packages and the programs that we want to bring in to create innovation and smart jobs for the people of Western Sydney. That is exactly what this budget is all about. We can look at the small business packageâ€”the smallest small business package in our nation's historyâ€”that will reduce taxes and create opportunities. It was really wonderful to have the Minister for Small Business in Lindsay on Tuesday last week. He was so well received. He was able to meet and talk with so many of the small business people in Western Sydney. Under those opposite, over half a millionâ€”500,000â€”jobs were lost in small business. That is just not sustainable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just in small business where we need to look for jobs. I would also like to applaud the work of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Alan Tudge, who came out to Lindsay only a few weeks ago. We conducted an Indigenous business forum talking with local Aboriginal people who are making their own way, building their own businesses, employing other Aboriginal people. It was wonderful to see that spark. After the meeting with the parliamentary secretary, that group of 20-odd Aboriginal business owners in Western Sydney now want to build their own Aboriginal chamber of commerce in Western Sydney. That is the opportunity that this budget and the programs from this side of parliament provide to the people of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next very big piece of the budget is the government's $50 billion infrastructure program. It is quite timely to have the member for Mayo, who will be the architect of much of this investment, in the chamber today. A lot of that will be spent in Western Sydneyâ€”and you can look at some of the reasons why, particularly as a result of those opposite. Phillip O'Neill who is a professor at the University of Western Sydney made an address on 19 April 2013 where he stated that, between 2006 and 2011, the region of western Sydney lost 6,842 jobs in manufacturing. The electorate of Lindsay will see less than five per cent of traditional manufacturing. No longer can we look at Western Sydney as a place for traditional manufacturing. We need to think bigger. We need to think greater. We need to work with partners like the University of Western Sydney to build an innovation corridorâ€”jobs like biotech. This is going to be the sort of terminology that will be spoken about by the people of Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This infrastructure spend will go further. It will invest $3.6 billion in a roads package that will be shared with the state government. This $3.6 billion road package will deliver so many jobs and create opportunities for organisations like the EJ Cooper group, or Baiada, who will invest, over and above the value of their 280 hectares, $2.5 billion in the people of Western Sydney. The science park will create 12,200 jobs in biotechâ€”12,200 jobs that will be in places like agribusiness and smart agribusiness. This is exciting news for the people of Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, we will be investing $1.1 million in the planning of the Northern Road from the M4 up to the Great Western Highway. This is an area that has caused so many challenges for so many people every day of the week. The federal government is also lending $45 million to the state government to build the Werrington arterial road. Now, this will take a lot of pressure off the Northern Road intersections on the M4, as well as the Mamre Road intersections on the M4. The sod-turning for that project was on 9 March. A $35 million extension of Mulgoa Road will help the pain point just outside the plaza, under the railway bridge, so that when this project is finished the flooding under that railway bridge should be a far-distant memory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to black-spot funding, we have invested $160,000 in a single-lane roundabout at Phillip and Gascoigne streets in Kingswood; $80,000 for pedestrian safety measures along Parkes Avenue between Victoria Street and Werrington Street in Werrington; $60,000 for a stop safety island at the intersection of Dunheved Road and Tasman Street in Cambridge Park; $60,000 for a median island and curve realignment on Kurrajong and Boronia streets in North St Marys; and $40,000 for median island and stop signs at Terry Brook Road and Fifth Avenue in Llandiloâ€”in fact, $6.1 million on Roads to Recovery across the region. This is a fabulous achievement and this will mean so much to all of us who live in Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the innovation corridor really is, I think, the most spectacular piece of what this government has achieved for the people of Western Sydney. The innovation corridor will travel from Narellan through Penrith, all the way up to the north-west growth sector, linking the north-west to the south-west. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the pieces that have made this project of the innovation corridor so real is the free trade agreement with China and the memorandum of understanding between the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine and the University of Western Sydney. This enables the University of Western Sydney to commence clinical trials on Chinese medicines to find ways to propagate or synthesise the active ingredients and to then commercialise these medicines. This will create so many wonderful jobs for the people of Western Sydney. Working with a university that really does see a bright future for our region is very, very exciting. Furthermore, the government have paired with the university and supported $3.1 million for 10 research grants. This is really important research. Additionally, the Werrington Park Corporate Centre, the first building of the Sydney IQ facility, is predicted to have 6,000 smart jobs, again in biotech. This project commenced with a $13.573 million investment from the federal government and will initially employ 450 to 500 people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lindsay is a family community and one of the youngest electorates in the parliament. One of the things that we have been known for a very long time is our sporting prowess. We as a government have supported the families of Western Sydney, including the families of Lindsay. We have been supporting the children to play the sports that they want to play. We have been upgrading fields right across the region: to Hickeys Lane Rugby League fields, we provided $45,000 to improve the playing surfaces; to the Andromeda Oval in Cranebrook we have provided drainage and upgrading of the playing surface, another $25,500; at the Grey Box Gum Reserve, we resurfaced the No. 2 oval and we have built an awning and a clubhouse, another $60,000; $26,000 towards the Andrews Road Baseball Complex, where we have constructed fencing and also built some tiered seating; $20,000 towards the Hunter Fields at Emu Park, where we have provided lighting so the children can now practise and play at night-time; and $90,000 to the Jamison Park netball courts in a shade structure and canteen upgrades. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a wonderful achievement because a lot of people think that Rugby League is the No. 1 sport in Penrith, but it is our third biggest sport. Netball comes in first, with soccer coming in second. Our netball courts in Penrith at Jamison Park attract many state and national titles to playing there. This is a great investment in netball for all young women who play netball right across our country. We have also invested in all the different sporting champions who have played for and represented our region right across the country, with some $4Â½ thousand in individual grants. They include people like Georgia Britton, Emily Imber, Cheyne Easthorpe, Samantha Thrupp, Amy Kellett, James Dare, Elise Izzard, Brennan Rymer and Aimee Carlin, just to name a few. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I talk about the entire sporting package, I think the jewel in the crown is what will be the Western Sydney Community and Sports Centre. It will essentially be like an indoor rugby league field on a sprung timber floor. Think about how many netball courts that is, how many basketball courts that is. But it is not just a sporting facility. This facility will be paired with, once again, the University of Western Sydney to come up with innovative sports science to ensure that we produce elite athletes in Western Sydney. This facility will also be the third biggest exhibition space in New South Wales once it is completed: Darling Harbour, No. 1; Homebush, No. 2; and this facility in Penrith, No. 3. Having those sorts of high-level conferencing facilities available to the people of Western Sydney will do so much for creating jobsâ€”once again, smart jobs for the people in Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have done so much more. It was only on Tuesday last week that I had both the Assistant Minister for Social Services, the minister looking after the NDIS, Hon. Senator Mitch Fifield; and the state Minister for Disability Services and Ageing, Minister John Ajaka, in Lindsay, where together they signed a memorandum of understanding that will bring forward the rollout of the NDIS. It was so exciting to have those two men there in Lindsay, signing something that is going to mean so much for children right across Western Sydney. In fact, the 2015 budget provides $20 million to fund the NDIS packages of up to 2,000 young people with a disability in the Blue Mountains and Penrith regions. This is exciting news and it is great news for children living with a disability, their parents and their carers. I would also like to thank Lisa Moffat, from the Kurrambee School, who is holding a parents' forum in the coming weeks to help parents of children with a disability with the transition into the NDIS. I would also like to commend the work of the NDIA, who have already commenced operations in the Penrith region to help families transition to what is going to be a really wonderful program to help so many of our young people living with a disability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With all this investment in growth in the region it is very important that we also talk about the what it is going to mean for the environment. We now have our green armies on the ground. At the last election we promised to invest $15 million in Western Sydney to protect much of the Cumberland conservation corridor to link essential areas of biodiversity together. I would like to thank the reference group that has come up with the key pieces of land that we have acquired. It was wonderful to have the Minister for the Environment, Greg Hunt, in Lindsay a few weeks ago to have a look at the first pieces of land in Londonderry that will provide this conductivity. These pieces of land had been untouched for 30 years and were in very good condition. They have large trees which are wonderful habitat for so many of our wonderful native flora and fauna.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to this, we will see one million trees being planted in Western Sydney. This is very good news for the environment right across Western Sydney. We have 15 Green Army teams. I would like to thank the Deerubin Land Council and also Muru Mittigar, who have been providing training and opportunity to so many local Indigenous men and women who are participating in these Green Army programs. It is nice to see the synergy of these different groups working together and providing the essential needs to the environment in Western Sydney. I could go on; there is so much more to talk about. For instance, we recently held an ice forum which was attended by over 100 people from the local community who came to talk to us about how we can end the scourge of ice in Western Sydney once and for all. Over the coming days, we, with this community of experts, will be producing a 28-page report that we will be handing to the national task force.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="159771" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROWLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  In preparing to speak on the appropriation bills, I looked up my speech on the same topic from almost exactly a year ago. It is curious that many of the issues I raised at the time were not only reflected in last year's budget but have also been continued in this year's budget. So, whilst it is almost a year ago to the day, the sentiment is still the same in relation to this year's budget. I would like to make my comments with an emphasis on the Greenway community. From going around my electorate of Greenway listening to constituents over the past week, it is clear that they have two views on this budget; the first is the lack of focus on jobs and the second is the level of unfairness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is not a budget for the future of Australia, nor is it a plan for the people of Greenway; it simply builds on the broken promises and unfairness of last year's budget. We hear all this talk about investment and infrastructure financing, but the fact is that a whopping amount of money in financial assistance grants was ripped from local government in parts of Western Sydney. To name just two, Blacktown City Council will lose $6.7 million over four years and Holroyd City Council will lose $1.4 million over four years. Among other measures that are going to hit Greenway particularly hard are the cuts to family tax benefit which will leave some families $6,000 a year worse off, cuts to paid parental leave which will leave about 80,000 mothers worse off, cuts to the Child Dental Benefit Schedule and $30 billion of cuts to schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget will hit over 10,000 Greenway families with unfair cuts to the family tax benefit. The Prime Minister said that this budget will not come at the expense of the family budget. I note, however, that a single-income family on $65,000 a year will be as much as $6,000 a year worse off. By kicking families off family tax benefit B when the youngest child turns six and freezing family tax benefit rates, over 10,000 Greenway families are going to be hit by this. It was curious too to hear the Prime Minister talking in question time about wanting to leave people trapped on welfareâ€”this notion that his government is about employment services. I note that, prior to the last election, the ABS put the unemployment rate at 5.7 per cent; today, it is 6.2 per cent. So all this talk about putting people into work is quite useless when you do not have jobs for these people to go to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned almost exactly a year ago, Western Sydney has an unacceptably high youth unemployment rate. Included in that are specific gaps between certain emerging communities, certain people in our communities who find it incredibly hard to find work; they have either arrived as migrants or are second-generation migrants, and they are finding it incredibly hard to find stable work. In Western Sydney, we had programs that were workingâ€”programs such as Youth Connections and the Partnership Brokers. Some time ago the Prime Minister went to the United States, and he spoke about a fantastic scheme there that connects young people who are still at school with employment and employers. He said: 'Wouldn't it be great to replicate that scheme in Australia.' How curious that we had a Prime Minister who wanted to replicate that scheme, yet, in his own budget, he cut the very programs that were having a demonstrable effect, an extraordinary success rate, in Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And you do not need to take this from me. I would like to quote from a couple of constituents who have contacted me about this budget, just to illustrate this. The first one is someone named Stephen, who says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Jobs is one of the biggest problems facing young Australians. I have three children of whom one is currently looking for work in the trades. In what appears to be a booming housing and development sector there appears to be no path for young Australians to get into the work force. Mostly there needs to be an education of Australian businesses to nurture these people as they ARE our future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He also makes some comments in relation to child care and balancing child care and work issues:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am well passed the child care issues but remember those days where my wife broke even in working and sending children to child are. â€¦ Lower income families need the system support to get ahead and deserve it. One thing that needs to tie into child care is immunisations. This fact needs to be pushed to help the greater community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I support that also, 100 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To quote from another person, Mr Ali from The Ponds:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I think currently the national issue #1 is JOBS. For a large section of our population the job market presents a scenario of doom and gloom. For some getting a job, any stable job is proving to be a dream that is too good to materialise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of family tax benefit and how my area is being hit by this I quote from a constituent named Leesa:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As a single working Mum with a teenage son with a disability I am disappointed with the budget implications for our family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Family Payment Part B is an essential part of my weekly budget. It allows me to work part time and continue to care for my son without requiring respite or other government assistance. It allows me to balance the competing demands of home and family. By working part time I do not claim a carer's pensionâ€”even though I earn only a little above the threshold. Just because my son is older than 6 years does not mean that he requires my care any less. I would ask that the current age of 16 years be maintained.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, there you have itâ€”some real examples from people in my electorate on some of these issues that go to the cuts contained within this budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to mention an extremely important issue that affects my constituents also, and that is this government's attack on paid parental leave. Greenway has one of the highest take-up rates of paid parental leave and in fact it features amongst the 20 hardest hit for these paid parental leave cuts. I also find it extraordinary that this government would seek to make an issue of this scheme, provided under legislation passed by this parliament, and that accessing this scheme and accessing employer schemes is somehow a 'double dip'. And I noticed how quickly this government retreated on these matters of using terms like 'double dipping'. They were not only offensive but just plain, outright wrong. I have gone through from May 2010 some of the current government members' views on some of these matters. It is quite clear. If you look even at the now Prime Minister's comments he is spruiking his rolled gold paid parental leave schemeâ€”the one that he has retreated from, the one that he was so committed to that when he could not get his own side to follow it, to back it in, that he decided to abandon it. He said that this is his signature policy, that this is his principal, that he is a convert and that converts are the biggest zealots. And then he turns around in this budget and wants to push women, who are not only entitled to claim under their employer but also entitled under the law to make claims from this scheme that was put in placeâ€”he dares to call them double dippers, to not be embarrassed that some of his own ministers are in a situation where they have accessed it. And then Mr Hockey, the Treasurer, comes out and claims, 'Maybe their wives didn't tell them.' It just gets better and better on this issue of paid parental leave, and I think it shows one thing: that this is a Prime Minister who stands for nothing, and this budget is proof of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to another issue, and that is the modelling that has been done by NATSEM which clearly shows that families are going to be worse off, and worse off more over time, if they are on lower incomes. It is clear from this modelling that a family with a single income of $65,000 and two children will be $6,164 a year worse off by 2018-19, and a single mother with an income of $55,000 and two children will be $6,107 a year worse off by 2018-19. It is proof that this government merely talks about supporting families but when it comes to the crunch does nothing to support them and in fact does the complete opposite. It does not matter how many times this government seeks to call its budget fair; the reality is that it is not. You can also see it from the modelling and the analysis done by ACOSS: more than $15 billion ripped from families and low-income earners under this budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note also that in question time today those opposite chose to claim that this modelling somehow lacked integrity. Well, I would point out that in May last year the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span>reported that NATSEM has previously been 'described by the Prime Minister as Australia's most respected modelling outfit'. It is quite apparent, and people are alive to this. As my constituents have been telling me over the past week, this is a budget that seeks to use the word 'fair' but is not fair in its practice whatsoever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last issue I want to mention, which I have taken up on behalf of the residents of Blacktown and also on behalf of one particular organisation, is a matter that I have raised previously in this place, and that is the effects of the cuts that have been continued under this budget on an extremely reputable organisation that has been operating in Blacktown for 41 years. For 41 years Blacktown Community Aid has provided service to the people of Blacktown, helping people in emergency situations, giving them advice and basically enabling them to participate in their community. But these funding cuts have forced Blacktown Community Aid to close its doors, and there is nothing in this budget to indicate that there will be anything to the contrary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the shutdown was imminent, which was in late March, I met with the remaining staff of Blacktown Community Aid, and we agreed that I would make representations on their behalf to the responsible minister, essentially a begging letter drawing the minister's attention to the returns that are achieved by Blacktown Community Aidâ€”and, I might mention, Holroyd Community Aid, which has done an equally exemplary jobâ€”for a relatively small outlay. It would say that we would be pleased if the minister would come and see firsthand the work that is done here and the difference it has been making in the community for four decades. I am happy to stand corrected, but the last time I checked I had not, I believe, even received a response to that representation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a situation where we have up to 60 clients each week seeking help from the centre. It is something that not only is supported by Blacktown council and every other non-government organisation, I believe, that exists in Blacktown but also is supported by the community and has been for four decades. To have a situation where we have people who, by and large, volunteer their time and energy for such an important cause is an absolute disgrace and it is an indictment on this government that they have had to shut their doors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most cruel things about this situation is that Blacktown Community Aid only became aware that it was going to have to close its doors three days before Christmas 2014. Since that time, the community has gotten behind this organisation. I have made strong representations on its behalf, making its case here in the parliamentâ€”but this has clearly fallen on deaf ears. I would say to this government that if you are serious about wanting to make a difference in Western Sydney communities and wanting to support people who seek to support themselves and who are seeking a hand up and not a handout then you will support Blacktown Community Aid, the minister will consider the representations that I have made to him and we will be able to reopen Blacktown Community Aid and allow it to continue serving the people of Blacktown.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closure, this is not a budget which looks at the long-term future and long-term welfare of the people of Western Sydney. What is critical to their long-term futureâ€”and I get this not only from parents but from people in our community who are serious about enabling young people to get into workâ€”is a serious focus on science, maths and the jobs of the future. That is what Labor is committed to. That is not only a vision but a reality that can be created by the right policy settings that are focused on the future and focused on technology and not some backward-looking policy with the mere use of words such as 'fair' or phrases such as 'getting people off welfare into work' on the one hand and then on the other hand taking away and cutting all the programs that were actually doing an outstanding job, particularly in Western Sydney and my electorate of Greenway, in getting young people into work, meaningful employment and careers. These were programs that had been supported not only by the organisations which delivered them but by the broader business community, local government and just about every element of the Blacktown business sector. With those comments, it is quite clear from the reaction that I have received from my local residents that this budget is not fair and it is not a budget for the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="30379" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROAD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  I am quite pleased to be able to talk to this chamber, the people in the gallery and the Australian people who will be listening online and watching on television. It is a wonderful thing to have the opportunity to talk in the chamber. We sometimes take it for granted. I want to reflect a little bit on the journey that has made us into such a great country and has afforded us the standard of living that we enjoy. It has not just been by chance. It has been because of good decisions and often hard decisions. It has been because of the endeavour of every Australian who chooses to pull together to contribute rather than take. There is that great saying about those who put their hand up rather than their hand out. This budget is about those who put their hand up and not their hand out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge we have had since we have come to government in the last 18 months is explaining the journey to the Australian people. When the Howard government came into power in 1996, people had lived through the recession we had to have in 1992 when interest rates had been very high, when businesses had gone broke and when people who had had a great dream to purchase a home had then found that they were not able to make the repayments on those homes. They had lived through those difficult times. Then, when the budgets in the early years of the Howard government came in, they understood that there needed to be some cost cutting. They understood that we need to tighten our belts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a little bit of a different situation in the Rudd-Gillard years. What we saw there as we were going into the global financial crisis in a very strong financial position is that we effectively moved private debt into public debt. That is fine. That has a place at times in the Australian economy and the global economy to keep confidence up and to keep stimulating people. That was what happened. However, we cemented in many of our forward projections that ongoing stimulating effect without being able to fund it. You can move private debt into public debt for a little while, but there will be a reckoning. There is a need to then make some changes. There is a need to then rein in some of those costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge we have had is that people did not feel the effects in the Australian population. People did not lose their houses and jobs like they certainly did in America and like they certainly still are in Europe. Unfortunately, then, we have had a difficult narrative to say to people that things have changed, that the economic climate has changed and that we have to meet some challenges and constructively pull together if we are going to continue the prosperity that we as Australians enjoy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People are beginning to realise that now. I think this is the difficulty that the opposition are having in trying to explain their narrative. While the narrative might sound good, people understand at the moment that the economy is difficult and that we are very much at a crossroads and we can grasp the opportunities but we can also falter if we do not have the will and the ambition and the internal fortitude to make tough decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have put forward a raft of tough decisions. Some of those from the first budget needed the rough edges knocked off. There is no doubt about that. It is the role of the Senate to try to hold us to account and knock off rough edges. But people have realised now that the job market is a little softer, that things are little bit more difficult. They are looking for a government that is prepared to make those tough decisions and to seize the opportunities so that, together, our best years can be ahead of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A budget really is an economic document and it is the engine room for us to build the society that we want to have. Everyone concedes that we want a society that looks after those who cannot look after themselves, looks after senior Australians, looks after our young and unemployed so that they can get on that first rung of the working latter, has a good defence system and has good roads. These are the things that we want our society. But you cannot build those things unless you can afford to pay for that with the dollars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The dollars come from the work of average Australians. The government actually does not have any money; the government has your money. It always needs to remembered that money that the government has is your money. Often people say a great line to me, 'The government has gotta.' I say, 'Who is the government? The government is you. The government is a reflection of you. It is your hard work and then we are entrusted with spending your money to build the society that we want to have.' We cannot just spend money we have not got. We have to spent it frugally and make tough choices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have done since coming into government has been a very interesting narrative. We made some very tough choices in the first budget. We have then been very mindful that we sit in the Asia-Pacific region, so we have to capitalise on the opportunities that sit in the Asia-Pacific region. Through the work of Andrew Robb and through the backbench trade committee, we have developed free-trade agreementsâ€”which had been stalled for a very long timeâ€”and have stitched those deals up with Japan, China and South Korea. As the global market changes, as iron ore has contracted and as coal has contracted, we have some great opportunities that are really the hard work and the working out of those three free-trade agreements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is actually about seizing those opportunities. It is one thing to have an opportunity, but it is quite another thing to turn an opportunity into a reality. This is the 'yes, but how' budget. For those in the gallery, these are my favourite three words: 'Yes, but how.' People always say, 'What is this policy and how does it apply to me?' That is how I look at legislation: 'Yes, but how.' We hear, 'We want to have universal education,' from the opposition and I say, 'Yes, but how?' They say, 'We want to have free health cover,' and I say, 'Yes, but how?' This is the 'yes, but how' budget. This is the budget that explains to us how we can move to seize the opportunities of the free-trade agreements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will tell you how we are going to do it: we are going to do it with the great ingenuity and the great thought processes and dedication of average Australians. I believe, with a lot of confidence, in average Australians. I believe that Australians are smart and that Australians work hard. If you give them an incentive, then they will go out, turn our economy around and do anything that they set their minds to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, we have 15,000 small businesses. They are mums and dads, usually. They have often got the children working. They are trying to build their life and build their prosperity through small business. This budget is seizing the opportunities for them. There is a 1.5 per cent tax cut for small businesses. There is accelerated depreciation for purchases under $20,000. There are great things for agricultural businesses. Even for those businesses that are not registered as corporations, we have found a way of making sure that they also receive a tax cut. Often, there are productivity gains that need to be made if they are going to capture an opportunity. That is what this $20,000 accelerated depreciation is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the budget reply speech. It talked about an aspiration all five per cent cut for small business. Anyone who has been in small businessâ€”and I have been in small business since I was self-employed at 22â€”knows that they would take the accelerated depreciation of purchases under $20,000 time after time before I would ever go for a five per cent cut on a company tax rate for small business. It simply shows that they have missed the beat on this one. They have missed the mark. If I go out and talk to people in my electorate, which I have been doing, they will say that we have got this one right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only are we saying to small business that you have got to seize the opportunity but we have also presented a child care package that is about getting people reengaged in the workforce and getting young mums whoâ€”unfortunately, through necessityâ€”need to go back in the workforce to pay off their houses and often to help with the dreams and ambitions of their family. We presented a child care package that I think will be very welcome. There is also a part of this child care package that is going to assist in those small country towns, such as in my electorate, where the child care model does not always work in its traditional way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also understood that pensioners need to be valued. We have taken away the changes that were creating uncertainty for pensioners. We have said to those who are self-funded superannuation retirees that they have done well. We are very mindful that being a self-funded retiree at this time, where interest rates are quite low, is a difficult journey. We are not going to rob your superannuation. Also, those who are the poorestâ€”in my electorate, we have a lot of the poorestâ€”will be $30 a fortnight better off. There is a level of fairness in this that I think has been addressed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also mindful that if we are going to seize the opportunities that are before us, we need to get younger people who are unemployed working. Getting people on that first rung of the ladder is a critical step. Assistant Minister Hartsuyker has done a good job working on this and having incentives. If you are not working, you are going to have to turn up 25 hours a week and do something to get you job ready. You are going to have an opportunity to work with business, hand in glove, so that you are more in tune with the demands and the opportunities that businesses present people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a strong belief that the best thing you can give a young person is an opportunity. The best thing you can give a young person is an opportunityâ€”I have said it again because it is important. If you get a young person to have a job, have money in their pocket that they earned and have a sense of self-worth, that is something that puts their shoulders back. That is something that makes them stand taller and prouder. What we want for young Australians is to be involved in this great economy and to have great opportunity, and there is stuff here to put that first rung on the ladder. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Often it is mentioned to me by some of our senior Australians, who have still got something to give, that unfortunately they are passed over at times for a job. They might be 50 years old or older but they have got the beauty of wisdom and knowledge. They are the people who are going to drive a forklift and not break it, but their knees might not be as good as they used to be for jumping up and down into that truck cabin. They have often felt that they have not been able to get that job. In this budget there is a rejigging of the $10,000 Restart program to help those who are 50-year-olds or older to get back into the workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget also builds the society that we want to have. There is an additional $1.6 billion over the five years for lifesaving and life-enhancing drugs. Often people come into my office and say: 'We are in a situation where we are quite sick. If only this drug could be listed. That would add very much to our standard of living and maybe make us live that little bit longer.' Unfortunately, we all die; but if a drug makes us live a little bit longer then that is a good thing. There is some stuff in this budget that is really very important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things in this budget that I am most proud of is a very small amount of moneyâ€”it is listed as a line item in the health budgetâ€”for the Wimmera Health Care Group Oncology, Dialysis and Community Palliative Care Centre. We had a situation in my electorate where people were not able to get treatment for cancer because there were not enough services. These people were driving up to 400 kilometres, getting their chemo and driving back, stopping on the edge of the road to throw up because they were unwell from the chemo treatment. That $1 million is a line item in this budget. The centre will be funded. It will mean that people's lives will be saved; it will mean that people's lives will be enhanced. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So please look broader than the rhetoric that is being discussed around this budget. This is certainly a financial document, and there are some really good things in this budget that will help us build the society that you and I want to live in for a long timeâ€”a society that builds on the future. I am proud to be in a government that has delivered this budget.</span>

                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  I am pleased to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2015-2016 and related bills. Aged care workers can justifiably ask themselves: 'What does the Prime Minister and his government have against us?' For two years in a row, this government has ripped out money that was going to go into the pockets of the hardworking people who care for those people in residential aged care facilities, who care for people in their homes and who care for people with disability, frailty, infirmity or illness. This government has for two years in a row cut funding for aged care workers. Last year they ripped $1.1 billion from the Aged Care Workforce Supplement designed to address the pay, conditions and career development of some of Australia's lowest-paid workers. On top of that, this year they have cutâ€”as part of their $100 million cut from the aged care budgetâ€”$40.2 million from the Aged Care Workforce Fund. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott government promised to develop a coherent aged care workforce strategy to address the demands of an ageing population. We need to triple our aged care workforce in the next 15 years to meet the challenges of an ageing population. How can the Prime Minister justify a 15 per cent cut to the aged care workforce development programs and have no plans whatsoever to address the challenges ahead? We have a situation where 52 per cent of people living in residential aged care in this country have dementia, but only about 17 per cent of those people with dementia actually live in residential aged care. But guess what? Going for a surf in aid of a good cause to help those people with dementia is not the same as cutting $20.1 million from the Dementia and Aged Care Services Fundâ€”Budget Paper No. 2, page 151, if the Prime Minister cares to look at it. So going for a surf, Prime Minister, will not solve the problem. It might be a good causeâ€”and good on you for doing itâ€”but you cut $20.1 million from the funding for dementia in this budget, after you cut the Dementia and Severe Behaviour Supplement last year. Two years in a row, cuts to aged care workforce development for pay and conditions in the aged care sector; two years in a row, cuts to funds for dementia. In the next two decades we are going to have close to 1,000,000 Australians with dementia. What strategy is there in the budget to deal with this challenge? None. There was none whatsoever in the last budget and none in this budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My other shadow portfolio area is Indigenous affairs. The Prime Minister said before he got elected that he would be the Prime Minister for Indigenous people. In word and in deed, they would be at the heart of his government. What did the government do in their first budget? They cut $534 million from the Indigenous Affairs portfolio straight off the topâ€”all program cuts; that is what Senate estimates revealsâ€”yet they had the temerity to argue it was red-tape reduction, streamlining, bureaucratic changes and that this would in fact have no impact on front-line services. Again and again and again, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs said this on national TV and elsewhereâ€”but it is not true. In fact, we know from the submissions lodged to the Senate inquiry looking at the Prime Minister's Indigenous Advancement Strategy, the funding for which is in this budget, that front-line services have been slashed and burned. That is why we are not going ahead on Closing the Gap. They never talk about Closing the Gap, because we are going backwards on target after target.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Indigenous Affairs portfolio, once again, there are cuts of another nearly $146 million in this year's budget, including $46 million for health, which would help those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in community controlled health services and elsewhere to improve health and wellness and wellbeing and welfare amongst the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who, for so long, have been disadvantaged with dispossession, dislocation and discrimination. But this Prime Minister should hang his head in shame because it is his department. He brought Indigenous Affairs from FaHCSIA into his department and then he has defunded his own department. That is what has happened. Whether they are in Arnhem Land or Brisbane, whether they are in the Kimberley or in Melbourne, whether they are in the Torres Strait or Tasmania, Indigenous people across the country know. They know that this budget has betrayed them for a second time. For a second year in a row they have been betrayed by this Prime Minister because of what he has done in this budget. They know what was said before the election, and what he has now done in two budgets is completely different.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own backyard, in my own electorate, before the 2013 election, they opposed the Ipswich Motorway upgrade between Brisbane and Ipswich. It was so important for South East Queenslandâ€”the No. 1 projectâ€”that the Council of Mayors South East Queensland said, year after year after year, that it ought to be funded. When we were in government we upgraded it from Dinmore to Darra, at a cost of $2.8 billion. During election after election, campaign after campaign, I fought LNP Liberal opponents who opposed the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway. They voted against it again and again in this place. We know how important it was for the safety and the economic development of South East Queensland, where one in seven Australians live. In the last five years, 20 per cent of the actual growth in wealth in this country comes from South East Queensland. It is crucial to Brisbane, crucial to Ipswich, crucial to Somerset, Lockyer and the Scenic Rim, crucial to Toowoomba.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But before the last election, in something like a Damascus road conversion experience, all of a sudden, Senator George Brandis comes before the people of South East Queensland and says, 'We're gonna fund the last section of the Ipswich Motorwayâ€”the Darra to Rocklea section. We're gonna match Labor's commitment,' that we had put in our 2013 budget before we got tossed out of office. 'We'll match Labor's commitment. In fact, we'll fast-track it.' A couple of days before the last election, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Queensland Times</span> newspaper said: 'You vote Liberal; we'll fast-track the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway.' I had a look at the press release in this budget from the Deputy Prime Minister, the minister in charge of infrastructure, who lauded himself in question time today. There was no mention of the Ipswich Motorway upgrade from Darra to Rockleaâ€”none at all. I had a look at the forward estimates. Was there $20 million or $25 million? There is nothing on until 2018-19. Fast-tracking? Nothing until 2018-19? What about the people of Brisbane? What about the economic development along those corridors? What about the Ripley Valley development where 100,000 people will be living in the next 15 or 20 years? What about Springfield? There is about 30,000 people living in Springfield. They will have over 100,000 in the next decade and a half. What are they going to do? They are going to be stuck on what the <span style="font-style:italic;">Queensland Times</span> calls a goat track.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, 19 months later, there are no witches hats, no bulldozers, no cranes, no workers, no designs, no plans. So much for fast-tracking, and the budget papers reveal they have betrayed the people of South East Queensland on the Ipswich Motorway. They should hang their heads in shame. They have gone back to form. This is what Liberals do. They claim one thing before the election and then do another. Let's have a look at the budget papers. Let's have a look at what they said before the last election. They said there would be a budget surplus in the first year and each year thereafter. What did they do? They have doubled the deficit. Unemployment is high. Taxes are up. There are 17 new taxes. There is over $3 billion extra in taxes that they did not say they would do before the election. There have been pension changes and indexation changes to make it harder. In my area, 92.2 per cent of people are bulk billed, and guess what? The changes they wanted to do and their effective freezing of indexation in relation to those payments going to doctors will mean that more and more people in Ipswich and the Somerset Region will be turfed out of bulk billing. So much for universal health care in this country!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals have never once supported Medicare. They have always thought it was a con or a rort. It is the same thing with superannuation. They cannot find a superannuation bill or an increase in superannuation they will ever vote for. They have always opposed it. At the last election, I remember my opponent talking many times about paid parental leave schemes. The paid parental leave scheme that Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, now the Prime Minister, was going to bring in was rolled gold. He was going to bring in $75,000 for new mums. He has had every position he can possibly imagine on that and, once again, they cannot even maintain their position post this budget. They claim that people are double dipping and engaging in other types of practices. Yet they themselves do it. It is extraordinary that they have this position with respect to paid parental leave, and it is in the budget papers. It is simply astonishing that they would have this position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the budget itself, what happened last year? Last year, I can remember the cigars, the pats on the back and, 'Joe, you're a great mate.' Within a matter of months, a Liberal Party member could not get the Treasurer to a fundraiser and would not have him anywhere near his electorate, because it went down so badly. It was unfair on mothers, unfair on families, unfair on pensioners and unfair on the military, DVA veterans, the aged and Indigenous affairs, cutting $80 billion out of health and education. And, by the way, another $2 billion has been cut out of health funding in this budget, including another amount of almost $1 billion cut to an undisclosed number of health programs, according to budget paper No. 2, page 110. So they had a problem with their budget strategy last year. They had to fix it. It was not about the jobs of Australians. It was about the job of the Prime Minister and the job of the Treasurer. We know that this budget is all about saving their jobs. It is not about the jobs of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The youth unemployment in my electorate is 17.2 per cent. The unemployment rate has been hovering at about eight per cent for a while. It is too high. It is way above the national average, and we have a challenge in my area in relation to jobs. It will not be solved by disinvesting. It will be solved by consistent, good investment in infrastructure and job trainingâ€”not cutting more than $1 billion out of jobs training and skilling. It will not happen when you get rid of things like the trade training programs. I have about five or six high schools in my electorate that would have got trade training centres. The ones that are currently there are fantastic, and they are doing great work in preparing young people for jobs of the future. That is what they are there for. You cannot cut all of these youth training programs, including the kinds of funds that are necessary in TAFE and elsewhere, and expect the unemployment rate to go down. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this government has done is destroy, in large part, business confidence. If business confidence is riding high, why did they introduce the small-business concessions and tax cuts, and the roll back and depreciation changes in this budget? They know they got the budget strategy wrong last year. In their hearts, they know. The polls show that they know. They guaranteed, when they were doing their mobile offices or listening postsâ€”as they call it on that side of the chamberâ€”they know in their heart of hearts, and their constituents would tell them, they made a mistake last year. They knew it was fundamentally unfair, and their constituents told them it was unfair. So what do they do this time? Having voted against the small-business tax cut that we hadâ€”they voted against it; so much for the party of free enterprise, oppositeâ€”and having discarded the depreciation advantages we had for small business, and the roll back in relation to the advantage that small business would have, all of a sudden they discovered them and thought, 'That is not a bad idea.' Well, they should have listened to Labor when we had the legislation in the first place, when we had those advantages on the table for small business. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is short sighted and cobbled together. It is all about something that would really resemble an episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hollowmen</span>. It really is extraordinary. It is like their medical-research fund that they cobbled together, last year, six weeks before the 2014 budget, which made Soviet-era long-term planning look like a really attractive option. This government has monumentally failed the people of Australia. They said one thing before the election, they did another in last year's budget and, when that failed them and their political necks were on the chopping block, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer had to do something. Thirty-nine people opposite, in the Liberal Party backbenchâ€”and goodness knows how many of the parliamentary secretaries or those from the ministryâ€”voted against the Prime Minister in an attempted leadership coup, and the Prime Minister had to bring down a budget that said 'fairness'. It does not mean that your budget is fundamentally fair every time you say 'fairness'. It is not, and the people will see through it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWN" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COULTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Nationals Chief Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  I stand to speak on the appropriation bills. To those of you listening at home, those 15 minutes you will never get backâ€”listening to the member for Blair's speech is like listening to the captain of the Titanic do a lecture on risk management. Quite frankly, it is astounding that a person who was a member of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years could come in here and lecture this House on fiscal responsibility and budgets that are relevant to Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent six years sitting in this place, in opposition, watching the member for Blair's government take away the regional telecommunications fund and turn it into $900 cash splashesâ€”putting up school halls that schools did not want, that could not fit in the student body, putting insulation into houses that subsequently burned down. That contribution was absolutely appalling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Blair is also the opposition spokesman on Indigenous affairs, and he had quite a bit to say about the government's response in that portfolio. The big change we have seen with this government is that there is a responsibility. The biggest insult and the biggest discrimination made against our Aboriginal brothers and sisters is to have a lower expectation. The Labor Party way is to give them more money so as not to feel that we need to do anythingâ€”to measure success and commitment by giving them more money. What we see now is that there is some responsibility. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not putting in programs, to fund people, that make no changeâ€”year after year after yearâ€”while the people that need the funds are still living in poverty. There needs to be some accountability. For the member for Blair to talk about this government walking away from Aboriginal people is absolutely insulting. Through our programs that are getting students into schools, our support of the Clontarf Foundation, our employment programs and our mutual obligation, we are making a difference in the lives of these people. We are not just going to shove money out to people, to drive around in government cars and sit in air-conditioned offices, who make no difference to the people that they represent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was the eighth budget that I have sat through and listened to the Treasurer make on budget night. This is the first one in which I have heard agriculture mentioned, and mentioned as many times as the Treasurer did. We have seen in this budget that this government recognises that Australia is still reliant on agriculture to pay its bills. The wealth of this country still focuses on agriculture and, in its time of need, in drought, this government is supporting farmers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the previous government, the member for Watson, when he was the agriculture minister, said that drought was a thing of the past. The word 'drought' was changed to 'dryness'.  They said that this was climate change and we did not need a drought policy. So when we came to government, we had no policy for drought and the cupboard was bare. We have seen nearly half a billion dollars committed to farmers in supporting drought assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say: it is still tough out there. With the support farmers are getting from this government, it is still tough and, quite frankly, they will be doing it tough in those areas around Walgett, Coonamble, Brewarrina and Bourke in my electorate until it rains. But at least now there are about 5,000 farmers around Australia getting household support. We are seeing funds going into communities to build community infrastructure and create some employment in these towns. So for the member for Blair and other members in opposition to be critical of this budget is absolutely nonsensical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Policies introduced by this government will help regional Australia stimulate growth. The $20,000 tax offset and the accelerated appreciation for water storage and fodder storage and fencing will make a real difference to stimulating not only agriculture but the communities and towns that support it. Indeed, last week I spoke to the manager of Mitre 10 in Dubbo. He said that in the three days after the budget there was a noticeable increase in activity, as tradespeople came in and purchased electrical tools and the like. The person who owns the computer store was saying that there was an increase in interest by businesses wanting to update their IT. We are starting to see small business being recognised and policies put in place that enable small businesses to grow and prosper. We know that, in Australia, the people of Australia know best. They are the ones who want to be unshackled from government and able to get on with it. They do not want this Big Brother approach where Big Brother knows bestâ€”and we have seen such policies as the school halls program that were an absolute farce and a waste of money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget we see a great stimulus for small business. Through our jobs program, the member for Cowper, the Assistant Minister for Employment, who just left the chamber, has a large amount of funds to put people back into work. This is the idea of mutual obligation where, if you are a citizen of this country, sitting at home doing nothing is not an option. You need to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty and allow people to have the dignity of workâ€”to have a reason to get up in the morning, to gain the skills and the training, to get back into the workforce and to be an example to their children so that their children understand the concept of work. If you are at work all day, at night-time you might be sleeping and allowing an environment where your children can have a regular, stable lifestyle. The previous government were absolutely missing from the field when it came to this. Their answer was to write out another cheque, borrow some money, hand some money out to other group and pretend that they cared by the size of the cheques that they wrote, rather than taking responsibility and real ownership themselves, where members of parliament are part of their communities and are prepared to put in policies that will be beneficial not merely to the people that they represent. It might not necessarily be popular in all quarters, but it is the right thing to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen a continuing commitment to infrastructure. In the last 12 months, I have seen more federal funding coming through my electorate for infrastructure than I saw in the previous six years. The previous member for Parkes and I have seen money going into the Newell Highway through the bridges program and the Black Spot Program. We are seeing work commencing on the inland rail. Rather than just talk about this, we are actually seeing work going on out there now with the final route selection, environmental work and community engagement. It was only an academic discussion until this year. We have a government in charge now that actually does things rather than just talk about things. Through the Stronger Regions program, we are seeing some real funding to stimulate economic growth in regional Australia. The money for the Dubbo saleyards will be a benefit not only to the economy of the Dubbo district but for the whole of western New South Wales. It will set Dubbo up as a livestock exchange centre that will service probably 30 to 40 per cent of New South Wales. This is targeted money going into real programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this commitment to roads, the Newell Highway has, unfortunately, claimed many lives over the years and we are now seeing work being done to widen the Newell and put space between the lanes. In the 40-kilometre section south of Goondiwindi in the northern part of the Parkes electorate, where fatigue sets in and, unfortunately, over the years we have seen some horrendous accidents, we are now seeing some real work going on. The Roads to Recovery Program will be doubled for local government areas in this coming year. As a former mayor, I understand the need for that money so that councils can prioritise and target where it needs to go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, this is a government that lets Australian people get on with the job that they want to do. This budget is coupled with other policies that we have implemented over the last 18 months, such as our red-tape reduction program, which unshackles small business and the Australian people and enables more productivity and employment. We are starting to see confidence returning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who spent last week doing about 3,000 kilometres around the Parkes electorate and speaking with many people, I can tell you that the Australian people are very pleased that they have a government in charge that actually knows what it is doing. They are saying that they are willing us to continue to do what we are doing and do better, because they are terrified of a return to the days of the Labor government when we saw a surplusâ€”money in the bankâ€”whittled away to a deficit and debt, which has severely impacted our ability to do what we want to do. But what we see now is a balance between financial responsibility and social responsibility and the fact that we understand what drives our economy and are supporting those areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We support programs that actually have outcomes and are measured. I want to speak briefly about the Clontarf Foundation. We have funding now for, I think, an extra 3,000 places around Australia through that. In the Parkes electorate, in schools in Brewarrina, Bourke, Walgett, Moree and Coonamble, and in the three schools in Dubbo, we are seeing a real turnaround where young men, young lads, from families who were multigenerational unemployed, now have real hope. The former school captain of Brewarrina is now doing a fine arts degree at Newcastle university. A couple of boys from Coonamble, after undertaking a training program, are now fully employed in road construction in Sydney. Boys who were truants, and who, at the age of 12 and 13, were taking drugs and smoking cigarettes and wagging school, are now attending school, are motivated and are looking to a future where they will be mentors for their younger brothers and sisters and a support to their family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget helps the Australian people make sense of last year's budget. Last year's budget had to reverse the decline in our terms of trade and our financial standing, and, with this budget, people can now see the logic behind that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that, from the comments I picked up, they are very appreciative that we are giving assistance to those who are having a go. Those who have got into the trap of intergenerational welfare will be encouraged to step into the workforce. There are other programs, like Green Army, that are giving young people an opportunity to experience work and undertake some training at the same time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I am pleased that I am part of the Liberal-National government. I am pleased that this budget is relevant to the Parkes electorate. And I am pleased to be part of a team that understands what Australia needs and is getting on with the job.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:10</span>):  Investment in infrastructure is of course the key to lifting economic productivity in this country. Just as inadequate infrastructure impedes economic growth, traffic congestion needlessly complicates life for people as they move around their communities. Inadequate highways mean road safety issues come to the fore. A failure to have efficient freight systems, whether by rail or by road and intermodal transport, is a handbrake on productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So that is why every year at budget time I look forward to announcements of new nation-building projects like roads and railway lines or port infrastructure. The first step on budget night is always to look for the summary booklet from the department of infrastructureâ€”or, as it used to be called, the department of transport. Last year, indeed, the booklet helped greatly to identify the re-announcements of the government, because you could go to the page on the Pacific Highway or the Bruce Highway and look at the projects. You could look at, say, the May 2013 budget on the Bruce Highway, then go to next year's and it was exactly the same. It showed that there were not new projects on either the Bruce Highway or the Pacific Highway from the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, they just did not bother. They did not bother to produce any documentation about infrastructure on budget night. Why? Because there were no new public transport projects. That is not surprising, given that they cut all the funding for public transport in last year's budget. There were no new major road projects anywhere in the country; not a single new project funded in this budget for freight rail anywhere in the country; nothing for ports or intermodal infrastructure; nothing for high-speed rail. Indeed, this budget cuts infrastructure funding by $2 billion over the next two years. That is a $2 billion cut, compared with the 2014 budgetâ€”compared with what they said they would do just one year ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no wonder that business commentator Alan Kohler wrote in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Business Spectator </span>of 20 May that any suggestion that this government is an infrastructure government is nothing more than spin. Mr Kohler wrote this: 'In fact, the detail of the Budget papers show a real decline in spending in the Infrastructure and Regional Development portfolio of 11.2 per cent between 2014-15 and 2018-19.' An 11.2 per cent decline over that period! It is no wonder that Mr Kohler has described the government's record on infrastructure as 'pathetic'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the worst possible time to cut infrastructure investment. Our economy is in a state of transition as we move away from the resources boom. According to the ABS, private sector investment fell by some 12.4 per cent between the December quarter 2013 and the December quarter 2014. In the same period, public sector investment on infrastructure fell by 17.3 per cent from the December quarter 2013 to the December quarter 2014. In these circumstances a responsible government would have stepped up to the plate and lifted infrastructure investment. The government tries to get around these facts and today the Deputy Prime Minister tried again. The analysis of Infrastructure Partnerships Australia shows that Commonwealth investment in infrastructure will fall from 1.55 per cent of the budget to 1.47 per cent across the forward estimates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday we saw exactly how big the challenge was. Infrastructure Australia produced its update of the 2008 national infrastructure audit. This audit found that, without action, traffic congestion would escalate the cost to $53 billion by 2031. It found that public transport use will double over the next 20 years. So what is the government's response to these challenges? They withdraw all investment in public transport. The Regional Rail Link project that will open next month is the largest ever federal investment in an urban public transport project, making an enormous difference not just to the Melbourne suburban rail network but to Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo. When it opens it will add an extra 54,000 commuter seats a day and will take thousands of cars off the roads. Labor funded projects such as the Gold Coast light rail. The member opposite, the member for Moncrieff, would be very familiar with it. Now he is a strong supporter of itâ€”not at the time but he now supports it. It opened last year. It has had five million people travel on it in less than a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also funded the Moreton Bay rail line in Brisbane, which is under construction, and allocated billions of dollars of investment for projects like the Melbourne metro and the Cross River Rail project. At the same time, we doubled the roads budget. We invested in important freight projects. The member for Parkes spoke about the inland rail project. The government have not added a dollar, not a cent, in their first two budgets for that project. Every single dollar of the $300 million was allocated by the former federal Labor government. Indeed, our rollout was faster and the government have spent less than we would have over its first two years in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to invest in both roads and rail. All of the experts know that that is the case. We need to engage in cities and urban policy. We cannot have a situation whereby the Commonwealth simply says that it is the business of someone else to deal with these issues, when 80 per cent of Australians live in our cities and when our cities produce more than 80 per cent of GDP. In his 1972 election campaign speech, Gough Whitlam said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A national government which has nothing to say about cities has nothing relevant or enduring to say about the nation or the nation's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet this government has shut down the Major Cities Unit. The next State of Australian Cities report was due in 2014. The government said it would produce it but in fact it has not been published. We know that the Department of Infrastructure signed an $11,000 contract with a printing agency for the 2014 report and the contract stipulatedâ€”it is available on the government websiteâ€”that the report would be published on 15 December last year. So it obviously had to be printed prior to the publication of the report. Where is it? It cost $11,000 and it has not appeared. It has just disappeared. Maybe it had something in it that was slightly critical. We do not know. We do know that for the first three years three million full copies were downloaded of this report, such is the wont for information on urban policy in cities. We do know that there is a demand there. We know the government has repeatedly, at each and every estimates, said that it would produce it. We know that it has been produced and printed and paid for. But it has just disappeared.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have also undermined the Infrastructure Australia process. Its key adviser on infrastructure, Infrastructure Australia, has of course been sidelined from the funding decisions that have been made by the government. They have not funded a single Infrastructure Australia priority project since they came into office. They said there would be a cost benefit analysis for projects costing over $100 million. There has been none. When the East West Link cost-benefit analysis was actually exposed by the incoming Victorian state government, it showed there was a cost benefit of 0.45 or 45c benefit for every dollar that was invested. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet this government stubbornly says, 'That's where the money should go'â€”not to remove level crossings, not for the M80 project, not for the Melbourne metro project, not for the West Gate project but for a project that simply does not stack up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's budget shows that the funding of Infrastructure Australia has been slashed from $15 million this year to $8.8 billion by 2018-19â€”in real terms, cut by more than half. That is an absurd proposition. They are ignoring Infrastructure Australia. They are ignoring cost-benefit analyses and they simply do not have credibility when it comes to the decisions that are being made, including the vindictive decision that is in this budget and which the papers show. These budget papers show that Victoria, with 25 per cent of Australia's population, will get eight per cent of the infrastructure investment contribution from the Commonwealth. If this Prime Minister thinks that Victorians will cop being punished because they voted for a Labor government last year, then he will find out what the response is come the next federal election because no group, no state or territory would cop that sort of behaviour from a federal government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply made it clear that a Labor government will give Infrastructure Australia the status it deserves at the centre of government. We will act on expert advice, as we did previously. We will also make sure that there is proper consultation, including with the opposition, on key appointments to the organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want an example of mean-spirited decisions that make no sense there is one that stood out to me in the budget, because it is a separate line item: the regional school buses program. That program is about getting seatbelts in school buses that operate in regional areas. Do you know how much it cost? It was $1 millionâ€”$1 million that was cut by those opposite. It makes absolutely no sense, whatsoever, to engage in that sort of cut. The managed motorways fund, which funds better infrastructure, smart infrastructure, using better signalling systems to make better use of roads that are there, was cut in last year's budgetâ€”in terms of the Monash Freewayâ€”with no new allocations. Labor's successful Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program was cut, with only $1 million of last year's $48 million that was budgeted actually spent. The government has even cut funding to its own Bridges Renewal Program by $60 million. An extraordinary proposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we move to the ideological section of this budget. On page 132 of Budget Paper No. 2, they say, in terms of shipping, that the reforms are aimed at 'better aligning employment conditions for ships based in Australia with international standards'. Can you imagine explicitly saying, in black and white, that you want Third World wages and conditions for Australians who work on ships? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know it is not just the shipping sector where they want to move to Work Choices on water. They also want Work Choices in the sky by abolishing cabotage that ensures only Australian based airlines can operate in our domestic industry, as occurs everywhere in the world. There is nowhere in the world where Qantas can say, 'I want to operate in your domestic routes'â€”not in the United States of America or in Europe or anywhere else. And yet, that is what they are proposing to open up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year's budget shocked Australians with its savagery, but this year's budget is no better. In infrastructure and transport it reveals the government's inability to deal with the challenges ahead. This nation needs an adult government prepared to invest in nation building. This country needs leadership on infrastructure. It needs nation building, it needs vision and it needs a Labor government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IPZ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  I rise, in complete contrast to the member for Grayndlerâ€”I am sure you will be horrified to hearâ€”to speak in support of the budget that was released just a couple of weeks ago. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Treasurer and the senior members of the ERC for the work they did in preparing a budget that I believe got the balance right. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They mostly got the balance right. They faced an enormous challenge in cleaning up almost seven years of Labor mismanagement and in getting the settings right, particularly for the small-business sectorâ€”to send a message of confidence and security that they could invest in the future of their businesses. Small businesses are owned by the people in our community who are prepared to take risks and invest their own money. In my case, in the seat of Gippsland, there are about 11,000 small-business owners who are critical to the employment futures of so many people in the Gippsland region. The Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and the members of the ERC worked very well and diligently to get the balance right between cleaning up that financial mess they were left with, by the Labor Party, and setting a confident and clear agenda for the future of our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the feedback I have received, as I have travelled throughout my electorate, over the past week or 10 days. The federal budget has been very well received throughout Gippsland, particularly with the strong focus on jobs growth and its message to the small-business sector that they can build with confidence and have a prosperous future in our regional communities. In fact, the small-business package has been the one item of the budget that I have received the most positive feedback about. I will get to that in a moment's time. The comments coming from small businesses in Gippsland have certainly been appreciative of the Treasurer's recognition that the small-business sector is the engine room of the Gippsland economy but also appreciative of the fact that it gives them the confidence to hire more people in the Gippsland community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming on the back of the successful negotiation of three free trade agreementsâ€”with China, Korea and Japanâ€”the budget does send that very positive message to the private sector to get out there and to invest in future growth, and I do congratulate the Treasurer on his work. In particular, from my perspective in Gippsland, the focus on increased road expenditure, on upgrades, not just on the major Princes Highwayâ€”the spine that runs through the Gippsland electorateâ€”but also through the doubling of Roads to Recovery funding for our local councils, has been very well received. In total there is about a $40 million package for roads, in Gippsland, over the next 12 months. It is a pity the member for Grayndler is not here, because I was going to pay him a compliment. It builds on the work that the member for Grayndler and I did when he was the minister for transport and I was, obviously, in opposition. I was going to pay him a compliment because he did support this project in Gippsland, the Princess Highway duplication, which has always enjoyed bipartisan support from both state and federal levels of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a total now of $260 million that has been spent on the Princes Highway through my electorate over the past five years, and this most recent budget announcement of $20 million will allow for the duplication to continue between Traralgon and Sale. It has been a multimillion-dollar boost to the road network. It delivers a very clear social and economic dividend. The economic dividend can be measured in terms of reduced travel times, once the work is completed, increased productivity for the movement of goods and services throughout the Gippsland region, and through access to the tourism attractions of the Gippsland region. So there is a very clear economic dividend that comes from the duplication. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is perhaps the social dividend that I get most excited about, and I think anyone who uses the road network gets most excited about it as wellâ€”that is, the safety aspects that are built into a new road, particularly a duplication, which allows for two lanes in both directions on our major highway networks. We know that investing in safer roads saves lives. In a regional sense, one of the great tragedies in our nation is that we have a disproportionately high road toll in our regional communities. While there has been some great work done by most state governments throughout Australia in reducing the road toll, most of the gains in recent years, in reducing the road toll, have come in metropolitan areas. The regional road tolls have been far more resistant, if you like, to the changes that have been made with new safety regulations, new laws et cetera and changes in driver behaviour. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Improving the safety of the road environment has the potential to deliver more in savings to the health budget by reducing road trauma than any other initiative, whether it be improved driver behaviour or enforcement and those types of activities. I encourage the minister for transport, and the Prime Minister in his endeavours to be an infrastructure Prime Minister, to continue to invest in improving the safety of the regional road network. We understand that if you can reduce the severity of those accidents you reduce the severity of injuries sustained, and the people involved can go on to live longer and more productive and healthy lives than would otherwise be the case. I do congratulate the former minister for transport on the funding he secured for the Princes Highway duplication but I also congratulate the current minister for transport on continuing that good work. As I said, a total of $260 million has been allocated to that section of road during my time in parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Princes Highway is part of the national road network, the duplication between Traralgon and Sale receives 80 per cent of its funding from the federal government and 20 per cent from the state government. I encourage the new state government in Victoria to continue to press its case for the full duplication of that section of road. Once this current round of works is finished, which will be towards the end of next year, in the order of $200 million will still be required to finish the job. That will be something I will be very keen to pursue with my state colleagues in Victoria and also with the federal minister. My state colleagues, in this case the member for Morwell, Russell Northe, and the new member for Gippsland South, Danny O'Brien, are very keen to also pursue those road safety upgrades. I will be working with them, hopefully with the support of the state minister for transport, to have those upgrades continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just about the Princes Highway. The budget also had some positive news for my electorate in terms of some other road projects in both the west and the east of the electorate. Under the heavy vehicle program some new rest areas are being constructed, and some new overtaking lanes are being constructed on the Princes Highway further eastâ€”the section of the road that is not on the national network. That is fifty-fifty funding between the state and federal governments. Those three overtaking lanes between Orbost and Nowa Nowa are well under way, and construction has been proceeding quite well despite the recent inclement weather we have experienced. While parts of Australia have suffered through a lack of rain, Gippsland, fortunately, over the last couple of years has had fantastic rain. I do take this opportunity to extend my best wishes to those in other communities who are suffering with drought. Gippsland has had its share of droughts over the years, including during my time in parliament, but right now the conditions in Gippsland are magnificent. We have benefited from some great seasonal conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The improvements funded under the current budget will obviously improve productivity right throughout the region and make our roads safer. Local councils have also benefited from the federal budget to the tune of $11 millionâ€”those three local councils being East Gippsland, Latrobe and Wellington. They will share in a doubling of Roads to Recovery funding this year. Roads to Recovery is one of those great programs that somehow has managed to withstand changes of government. We have not even changed the name, which is something very unusual for governments in the modern era. Roads to Recovery was initiated many years ago by the former leader of the Nationals, John Anderson, and it has survived through periods of budget difficulties. It survived right through the Howard-Costello years, through the Rudd-Gillard years and it is continuing today as a fantastic program. I think it works so well because of the simplicity of its design. This program gives local councils the chance to set their local priorities every year, and it has been a very successful program in the Gippsland region. This year we will benefit to the tune of $11 million, which will go towards some significant local road upgrades. Again I congratulate the minister for transport for securing the funding for that program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is good that the member for Franklin is here in the chamber because she has had a bit to say about another program, the National Stronger Regions Fund. It is a billion-dollar fund that was secured during negotiations between the National Party and the Liberal Party in the lead up to the last election. I congratulate the minister for securing that funding. I think 51 projects across Australia were supported in this budgetary round. One program is being funded in my electorateâ€”one out of two; you always like to win every bid you put in but you do not always get that lucky as a local MP. In this case, $4.5 million from the federal government under the National Stronger Regions Fund will go to the Wellington shire's Port of Sale cultural hub, and that has been warmly received by the local community. I was at a function last week and the mayor, Carolynn Crossley, spoke in glowing terms about how this $13.7 million project will assist Wellington shire. This grant has enabled a long sought-after project to be brought to reality, and again I congratulate the minister on negotiating that fund as part of the coalition agreement in the lead-up to the last election. I encourage other members in this place, whether they be on this side of the House or the other side, to work with their local councils to put forward some strong bids for the program. It is a competitive bid process, with 51 projects out of about 400 bids being successful last time. I would obviously like to see more projects successful in Gippsland in the future and I will be working with my community to make sure that occurs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, this budget is a particularly good one for small business. It is not just me saying thatâ€”that is the feedback I have been getting from the small business owners in my electorate. One of the great things about being a regional member of parliament is that you do get to meet dozens of people almost every day as you travel throughout your electorate, and they are never short on giving you some free advice. It is fair to say that over this past week the advice I have received from my electorate has been a bit more positive than I may have received after previous budgets. I will leave it at that! The free advice I have had this week is simply 'Keep up the good work; we like what the budget is doing for small businessâ€”this has given us confidence and we are already seeing a direct result in our own business.' This is the case whether it is small hardware shops selling more equipment to local tradies or electronics outlets selling more computers and that type of thingâ€”our package has been very warmly received. Of particular benefit is the ability for businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million to immediately deduct from this year's tax return the depreciation of an asset that costs less than $20,000. Quite frankly, that is just about every one of my small businesses in Gippsland. That is a reasonable figure to set the mark atâ€”it is your mum-and-dad operations with two or three staff members, perhaps. All I can ask those businesses to do is to shop locally as much they can to support other businesses in Gippslandâ€”the money will then go around in the community and provide even greater opportunities and support for local jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I am talking about local jobs, there is one issue that is of particular interest to me and other members in this place, particularly the member for McMillanâ€”and that relates to the Australian Paper mill located at Maryvale in my electorate. It employs in the order of 1,000 local workers. Earlier this year I publicly extended a challenge to other MPs, senators, ministers and particularly federal government departments to at least consider their procurement policies when it comes to using imported paper in their offices. I encourage them to consider switching to Australian paper. Australian paper has a range of products that are all fully certified in terms of environmental credentials. They have 100 per cent recycled paper; they have 50 per cent recycled paper. They are a world-class business operating in a difficult market. It is simply staggers me to still see a long list of Australian federal government departments that continue to use imported paper. I urge procurement officers in departments and I will be writing to all ministers, with the support of the member for McMillan, to urge all MPs to support Australian jobs and support Australian families. The economic, environmental and social benefits are there for Gippslanders and all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I promised earlier this year, I will get around to actually naming some of the departments which do not use Australian paper. Unfortunately, the list is quite long. There are only six that I can find at the moment that have Australian paper in their list and procurement guidelines. Fortunately for me, being the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, the Department of Defence does use Australian paper. The Department of Human Services does, Australian Customs does, and the Department of Agriculture recently changed its procurement guidelines after some discussions with the minister and now uses and offers Australian paper to its staff. ASIO and ASIC are the only other two I can find.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The list I have here has 15 other Australian departments which source their paper from either Indonesia, Germany or Austria. On that list is the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Immigration, the Australian Federal Police, the Department of Health, the Department of Industryâ€”the Department of Industry; that is amazingâ€”the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Department of Education, the Department of Employment, the Department of the Environment, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Department of Infrastructure, the Department of Finance, the Bureau of Meteorology and the Department of the Treasury. I apologise if I have wrongly named a department which has switched to Australian paper in recent times. If I have made a mistake, I urge them to give me a call in my office tomorrow and I will amend the public record for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But if I do not have a wrong, if these are the 15 Australian departments that do not use Australian-made paper, I simply ask the question: why not? Why on earth would the Department of the Environment be using paper from Germany? The Australian product is fully certified, it comes from a mix of plantation and native hardwood timber and it is harvested under strict environmental guidelines. This is a world-class industry which is being crucified by procurement decisions which are impossible for the average Australian to understand. How can it be cheaper and how can it be more environmentally friendly to bring paper from Austria, Germany and Indonesia rather than sourcing from Australian grown products? So I do urge other members of this place, ministers and procurement officers who are responsible for signing these contracts in their departments to at least consider supporting Australian families, supporting Australian jobs and buying the Australian-made product. Again, if I have got it wrong, if your department has switched to Australian paper, give me a call and I am happy to publicly congratulate you in the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COLLINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  It is great to be able to talk to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2015-2016 and cognate bills, the government's budget bills, because of course everybody knows that this budget was simply a political document to try to save the jobs of Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. They are not that interested in the jobs of Australians. You can tell that because their own budget papers talk about unemployment going upâ€”indeed, going up to 6.5 per cent, and that is the highest level of unemployment for 14 years. Sadly, it even projects that it will stay there for some time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget still contains a lot of the nasties from the previous budget, which was so unpopular with the people of Australia. It still includes the increase in the petrol excise, which will disproportionately impact on the people in rural and regional Australia every day as they go to work or take their kids to school. In this budget there is still the plan to increase the pension age to 70. I am sure that is something that the tradies who might be taking advantage of the instant asset write-off will not be very happy about. It still contains the deregulation to Australia's universities that could lead to $100,000 degrees. Still contains more than $80 billion in cuts to health and education, and of course it does not contain the fifth and the sixth year of the Gonski education funding that was promised by this government. It also contains family tax cuts. There are cuts to Family Tax Benefit Part A and Family Tax Benefit Part B.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, we have seen some modelling today which shows just how that will impact on average Australian families. To give you an example, for a couple on a single income earning $65,000 with two children, one in primary school and one in high school, over the four years of the budget it is a loss of more than $20,000. That is a very significant loss indeed. For a couple on a single income of $75,000 with two kids, one not yet of school age and one in primary school, over the four years it is a loss of $6,000. And for a sole parent with an income of $55,000 with two children, one in primary school and one in high school, again it is a loss of more than $20,000. How can the government say this budget is fair? What they are trying to do to these families is rip money away and, on the other hand, say that we need this budget saving so that we can fund changes to child care. They want to take money off some families and give it to other families, and the way they are going about it is absolutely not fair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget also includes the changes to paid parental leave. We saw some really appalling language used by the government to describe families that were taking paid parental leave, the government scheme and their employer's scheme. Of course, they seem to forget that a lot of the employees who are accessing employer funded paid parental leave have bargained for that leave. They have forgone other entitlements or possible wage increases to obtain that paid parental leave. They will have worked with their colleagues and with their boss and negotiated that additional leave so that they can spend more time at home with their newborn babies. They do not expect to be called fraudsters by the government when they access, legitimately, both schemes. And, of course, those changes to paid parental leave that are in the budget will affect more than 80,000 families. It is a loss of up to $11,500 per family at that critical time when many people are resorting to one income and are relying on this leave to spend time at home with their babies. Those opposite go around the country taking happy snaps in childcare centres. They go out and about in their electorates with tradies and say that this budget is full of good news. That is simply not true. They are linking cuts to family payments to childcare benefits for other families and they are taking money away from families with newborn babies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, those opposite talk about this budget being all about jobs, but what we actually see in this budget is unemployment going up. In my portfolio of employment services there is a package in relation to youth unemployment, which we are pleased to see they are acting on. Youth unemployment in Australia has been growing, and it has been growing at an alarming rate. There was a big announcement of $200 million for youth unemployment measures. As I went through the budget papers, I was looking and looking for it, but there was no new money for this; it is coming out of what is already allocated to employment services in the budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 July the government have their new jobactive program. They have taken money out of the jobactive program to pay for youth unemployment services, which is well and good, but they are actually admitting that jobactive will not work for young people. It will not work for young people because many young people are vulnerable. The new jobactive program will not work for vulnerable people, regardless of their age. The government needs to do a lot more if it wants to address long-term unemployment and unemployment for people with serious barriers to employment. It needs to invest to move people from welfare into work, as we keep hearing all the rhetoric about. This government is not seriously investing in jobs for people who face barriers to employment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also nothing in the budget about job creation. There is not a proper plan for job creation. Yes, there is a short-term plan for small business, but there is no long-term plan for infrastructure, for investing in education, for investing in science, for investing in innovation and for investing in those jobs of the future, where Australia's prosperity will lie. That is what we heard about in the opposition leader's budget reply speech. We heard about investments in science, technology, engineering and maths and how important they will be. They are really critical to Australia's future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past Australia invented some great things and made some great innovations. We need to ensure that Australia continues to do that in the future. We need the smart jobs of the future, the well-paying jobs of the future. We need to make sure Australians are qualified to take up these jobs, which means we need to invest in education. As I said earlier, the money for the Gonski funding that is so critical for our students' education is not there in years five and six of the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The youth unemployment programs the government has brought in are only replacing programs that were previously cutâ€”great programs like Youth Connections, Partnership Brokers and national career development services. All these wonderful programs were designed to get young people into work. So, for a government who says it is serious about jobs, there is not a lot of assistance in this budget to get disadvantaged people into work. The budget papers say that unemployment will be going up. I am not convinced and I do not think the Australian public is convinced that this budget is good news for those people who are trying to work in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to my other portfolio, the budget papers contain some interesting things, including a couple of funds under the Regional Development Program. One is called Stronger Communities, and $150,000 for each electorate is mentioned. A fortnight out from the budget, there is no information on exactly how this will work or what the process will be. We have been told that the involvement of the local member is going to be important, but we do not know what that will be. So we are not sure quite how this program will work. But I am concerned that it might work like the Community Development Grants Program, a program which the government created out of uncontracted Regional Development Australia funds. They put money into it andâ€”surprise, surpriseâ€”90 per cent of the funding went to coalition-held seats and contained a whole heap of election commitments. So I would be very concerned about the Stronger Communities fund and how that is going to work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, the Community Development Grants Program had an additional $50 million popped into it in this budget. Again, a fortnight out from the budget there is no process for applying for grants under this program. Surprisingly, there has been an announcement out of this programâ€”a program under which there is no process for people to apply. So, again, I would be very concerned about this program and how it is going to be used by the government and how it will apply across the country. We all want to see investment in local communities across Australia, but we want to be sure that that money is going to the best projects, the projects that support local jobs and local communities and that have a benefit for every community, with funding going right across the country. It should not simply be used as a bucket of money for coalition election promises, which is sadly where I think it is heading. So there are those two interesting little buckets of money in the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in the few minutes remaining to me, I would like to talk about my home state of Tasmania. Tasmania seemed to miss out in this last federal budget. Western Australia gets another half a billion dollars for infrastructure, but Tasmania, which has the highest unemployment in the country, misses out. What is worse is that not only do we miss out; the $100 million cut to the Midland Highway is still in the budget and there is a $120 million cut to rail infrastructure from state and federal Liberal governments. That was money for freight rail in our state that was supposed to build on previous investment by the Labor government. Further, the University of Tasmania is getting a funding cut over four years of over $125 million. So several hundred million dollars is coming out of my home state of Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday the Prime Minister was in town and he was asked about funding for the Mersey Hospitalâ€”it is a hospital on the north-west coast that, many people might recall, was bought by former Prime Minister Howard for the princely sum of a dollar from the state government. It is the only Commonwealth owned hospital, I think, in the country. The Commonwealth is in negotiation with the state for funding for this hospital, and everybody was expecting the Prime Minister to make an announcement that there was no money in the budget for it, but, of course, he did not. So we have no idea whether the money for the Mersey Hospital is in the budget or not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know one thing that is not there, and that is the Cadbury's money. People may recall that in the fanfare of the election the Prime Minister visited the Cadbury's factory at Claremont and announced 200 new jobs and an investment of $16 million in Cadbury's. Sadly, I have to report that on Friday, 80 Cadbury workers were told they no longer had a jobâ€”80 workers are now without a jobâ€”and my sympathies go to those workers and their families. This was an investment that was promised by Mr Abbott personally, but this money was not forthcoming. Now it is a budget saving; in the budget papers it is minus $16 million in the tourism budget. We are assured by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister that that money will still come to Tasmania, but nobody can tell us where it is in the budget. The Treasurer was asked where the money is and which department has it, but he did not know. The Prime Minister does not know either. So I am looking forward to Senate estimates to try to find out where this money might actually lie for Tasmaniaâ€”what projects it is earmarked forâ€”because nobody seems to be able to find it at the moment. Tasmanians do not have a lot of confidence that they will get this funding from the Abbott government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has not been a lot of good news for Tasmania in the budget. There was a little bit of good news, though: irrigation projects received some funding in the budget. They were announced by the Prime Minister a couple of months ago, and these projects have bipartisan support in Tasmania. The former Labor government invested more than $140 million in irrigation projects in the state of Tasmania, and the state and federal Labor governments established Irrigation Tasmaniaâ€”a wonderful body that has been putting together a range of irrigation projects. It has been talking to Infrastructure Australia to get the projects properly assessed. It is good to see they are getting some funding under the current government, although the funding envelope is somewhat short of what is required for these projects. Again, I am a little curious as to how the remaining $40 million will be found for these very important projects in an industry that is growing jobs in Tasmania. It is an area where we have invested heavily in the past and has had bipartisan support in the past. The agriculture industry has been going extremely well in Tasmania; many new jobs have been created in agriculture; and I would like to see that continue and to see additional funding come to my home state. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall it is not great news for my home state of Tasmania. There is no great news for families in this budget, particularly families who receive the Family Tax Benefit or for those people who are currently looking for a job in Australia. I do not think that this budget is something that those on the government side should be taking happy snaps about while they travel around the country, proclaiming that it is a great budget when clearly it is not.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  I rise to say that this budget concentrates on people who need or want to work and businesses that need surety and want to expand to take advantage of a lull in the world economy. At the moment there is quite a lot of money slushing around the world, but it is not being lentâ€”either because those who have it do not have confidence in those might want to use it or because the businesses themselves do not have confidence in the world situation to take advantage of it. Our government has said to small business in particular: 'We want to go with you, if you want to try your hand.' It has said to families who want to work or have to work as a couple: 'We'll make sure you have the means and the time to get out there and fill those positions.' Those positions will appear as small business hits its stride, whether it is on the North Coast or in western New South Wales. They are measures to stimulate and to give confidence to small business. The government understands their problems with the cost of production and in finding suitable employees. If they do expand there will be more mature people to fill the need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Calare we are very appreciative that from the Stronger Regions program $8.7 million is going to a recycling and filtration plant in Parkes, which is quite a long way from the Lachlan River. Every gallon does countâ€”perhaps I should say every litre or megalitre counts, whichever you want. We will send a bit down to the Riverina occasionally when the rain falls that way.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr JOHN COBB:</span>
                  </a>  It is a very big thing when regional areas see that government is willing to back them when necessary. I am happy to say that CareWest in Orange received $750,000 on top of their own money to set themselves up as a group in the regionâ€”it is not just about Orange; it about the whole regionâ€”to look after people with disabilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My part of the worldâ€”and I am very proud of itâ€”is the oldest part of regional Australia since Europeans came to the country, and Bathurst is older than any capital city in Australia apart from Hobart and Sydney; probably the only other city which is older is Parramatta. But I digress; what this area can do and will do is get into productivity. It is something that will pull Australia through the debt situation that it is in. I always say: in regional Australiaâ€”they are not paper shufflers, and they are not money transfer centresâ€”they actually do things; they dig them up, they make things and they grow things. We are the producers. Cities may sell and buy it, but we make it, we produce it and the world stands still without us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to mention some of those things which I believe our government has to look at over the next year or so as to what more Calare needs. Industry is not just about the production of physical things. Industry is also very much about tourism and sport, especially when it is international. I have to say that one example is the Bathurst races at the car track on Mount Panorama. There is a planâ€”and it is going to be quite an expensive planâ€”to have a second track in Bathurst. As I have already run by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Infrastructure, this will do a lot for the region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bathurst car races are not just the biggest car races in Australia; they are well known throughout the world, and people do come from around the world. The Bathurst 12 Hour, which is probably not as big domestically as the October races, has entrants from all around the world. But the racetrack is limited by an act of parliament, because it is part of the normal road work in the metropolis of Bathurst, so it is only allowed to shut down and run races five times a year. So a second track would actually allow two things: one, to hold events all the time; and two, once again, to have bike races. Apart from Phillip Island, there is no really big bike centre these days. Given how big Bathurst is as a race centre, it would certainly be enormous. So that is something that I think we have to look at.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is not talked about as being done in Bathurst, but it is very much about the university based in Bathurst. In the Riverina and Wagga, I believe, is the other part. This other thing, which we really want to get going, involves Wagga, it involves Orange and it involves the Victorian university, and it is a new medical school. It will not need a big amount of capitalâ€”nothing like the amount that is being put into the new medical school in Perth. What that new medical facility in Perth shows us is that, if it comes to training doctors, the money is there. I am pleased that the announcement was made about the new medical training facility for training doctors in Perth, because it shows that, when necessary, the money is there. What the member for Riverina and I will tell you is that the plan that our university has for training doctors means that those doctors will want to work in the bush, because students will be chosen by interview in the same way as at the veterinary school which CSU has at Wagga. That veterinary school has an enormous success rateâ€”I believe that over 80 per cent of all vets trained thereâ€”because it is done the same way. It is done by interview, and the university assures itself that that student wants to work in the bush or outside of the metropolitan area. This plan will work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was a big fan of the clinical medical schools, and I have a few of them in my electorate. They are in Orange, they are in Bathurst and they are in Lithgow. They have done good work, but they have not substantially lifted the number of doctors that are working in the bush. In fact, the figure is not all that much different to what it was quite some years ago. I am really pleased, and I congratulate Perth for getting a new medical school. I am so pleased, and I am sure the member for Riverina is too, because it shows that, if the need is there, we will find the money to open a medical school, especially one that will go across three different areas, involve two states and two universities, and have a total of 120 students with 40 students in each location. The money involved is small by comparison. If they go into the hospitals on current numbers, so be it. Between Wagga, Bathurst and Orange, we can find the places, presuming that we can have them. I think has to be a priority over the next year for the next budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was a big fan of the previous Deputy Premier of New South Wales when he picked up on the need for water storage in central western New South Wales. The site for the dam is at Cranky Rock, and it is just below Needles Gap, where the original site that we all wanted was. We wanted that site because it was narrow and it was deep. It was a very good site, it was higher and it would have had less evaporation. However, because of the need for the dam, I will go with Cranky Rock. Let us just make sure that we do it. The reason that I mention that here today is that I think, at the end of the day, the state have worked out how they can do a lot of the building but we will have to come in at the end. This is enormous for the whole region. More water storage means more confidence in urban development and more real estate confidence, but beyond thatâ€”which adds to it allâ€”there are untold numbers of mine sites, some of which, I believe, have not started at this time simply because of the cost of getting water to them. This is quite a serious dam: three-quarters or perhaps 70 per cent of the size of our current Lachlan dam. It is a big thing to do. It is a necessary thing to do. I think the past Deputy Premier was a hero for getting it to where it is, and I am sure that Troy Grant, the current Deputy Premier, will make sure that we go ahead with it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further west, around Forbes, there are two projects that, over the next year, we have to look very seriously at funding. They have a very good stock exchange. Half of western New South Wales heads to Forbes, Dubbo or, perhaps, Wagga lower down. The Forbes one is a very big, fat lamb one; it is also a big cattle one. They want to expand that. I have to say that some 12 years or so agoâ€”it might have been even longerâ€”we were successful in getting regional partnerships money to help them build it in the first place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is once again to do with sport, but it would be a huge thing for people travelling around Australia. There are not many serious drag strips in Australia. For anyone who has been to a serious drag race, let me tell you: when the big guys get out there, they blow you away. Alicia and I went to Western Sydney to the racetrackâ€”the name of it escapes me for the moment. When the big guys get out and you are standing 150 feet away, it is like a flamethrower in front of you and a 747 on top of youâ€”the noise! It makes your eyes water. Let me tell you, the earth does move when they take off!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the sorts of things which would absolutely increase the ability of our region to get up and have a go, quite apart from the things we do so well: our mining, our forestry, our agriculture, our pet-food processing and all the other food things that we do. These are the things that our government needs to look at very seriously to add to the great work that has been done in this budget for rural and regional business and agriculture.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  It has been said that history repeats itself: first as tragedy, then as farce. This is certainly true of the Abbott government's two budgets. Their first effort was definitely a tragedyâ€”a catastrophe even. The 2014 budget was without doubt the most extreme, the most unfair, the most disastrous federal budget handed down in living memory. It was bad enough that the government broke the promises it took to the last election. The government promised no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions, and no cuts to the ABC or SBS. Yet in the 2014 budget it delivered all four, and more besides.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the community's fierce opposition to the budget was about more than just broken promises. In the 2014 budget, the Australian people got to see what the Abbott government really stood for; what its real agenda wasâ€”not just what it would promise in order to win power. They did not like what they saw. In the 2014 budget, the Abbott government showed Australians its vision for our society. They showed us the type of country they want Australia to be: unfair, unequal, uncaring. They want Australia to be the sort of country which taxes the sick, the sort of country where education only goes to those who can pay, the sort of country which humiliates the young and unemployed. Abbott's vision bears no resemblance to the sort of country that most Australians want to live inâ€”and the community's reaction to the 2014 budget bore that out. The Prime Minister and his Treasurer have worn that budget like a millstone around their necks; not because they were poor salesmen, as political commentators sometimes suggest, but because the product was faultyâ€”and the Australian people knew it. Labor stood with the Australian community. We opposed that budget and we defeated the government's extreme and unfair agenda in the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After that dismal performance in 2014, the Treasurer returned here on 12 May for his encoreâ€”and, sure enough, it was a farce. In Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2015-2016 and related bills before the House today we see a foundering Liberal government producing an opportunistic, political budget designed only to keep their own heads above water. This budget is, as the Leader of the Opposition said in his budget reply speech:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ a hoax, a mirage, a smokescreen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government desperately hopes that this budget will atone for the excesses of 2014, yet some of the most unfair measures from last year remain in the 2015 budget papers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Leader of the Opposition has said, the Prime Minister has changed his tactics, but he has not changed his mind. This budget still rips $80 billion from schools and hospitals across the country, as was the case in last year's budget. It still inflicts higher fees and bigger debts on Australian kids seeking to further their education. It still withholds help from unemployed young Australians when they need it most. The Prime Minister had said this budget would not hurt families, but a single income family on $65,000 a year will be as much as $6,000 a year worse off. The government wants to kick families off family tax benefit part B when their youngest child turns six and to freeze family tax benefit rates. That cut will hurt more than 9,000 families in my electorate. As always under this government, middle- and lower-income Australians will be hardest hit. The budget also contains cuts to paid parental leave that will make around 80,000 new parents each year up to $11,500 worse off. The introduction of paid parental leave was one of our Labor government's great achievements. The Prime Minister, who had the audacity to appoint himself Minister for Women, is now seeking to tear that scheme apart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party so often and so arrogantly claim to be the party of family values, but now they will vote to reduce the amount of time that new mothers get to spend with their babies. Australians should not soon forget this. And I do not think they are going to forget that, for five years, we have had this Prime Minister, first as Leader of the Opposition and then as Prime Minister, say over and over and over again that the scheme that Labor introduced from 1 January 2012 was not adequate. That was his positionâ€”that there needed to be a more generous paid parental leave scheme. But what have we seen in this year's budget? We have seen the attack on and the reduction of a scheme that, until very recently, this Prime Minister said was not adequate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year's budget had very substantial cuts to the arts, my own portfolio responsibilityâ€”more than $100 million. The 2015 budget continues the government's assault on the arts. The government proposes cuts of $13 million through so-called efficiencies to arts and cultural programs run by the Ministry for the Arts, the Australia Council and Screen Australia. These cuts are serious, but what is of much greater concern is that Senator Brandis has taken $105 million from the Australia Council and placed it under his own personal control. Senator Brandis wishes to use this money to set up a so-called National Program for Excellence in the Arts within his Ministry for the Arts. Senator Brandis has appointed himself Australia's art-critic-in-chief. He has dangerously undermined the long-accepted principle that arts funding should be free of political interference and that funding decisions should be made at arm's length from government. That has been the case ever since the Australia Council was established as an independent statutory body by the Whitlam government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let no-one think that this is just a question of philosophy, how independent arts funding should be or what amount of peer reviewing is appropriate for arts funding decisions. This decision made by Senator Brandis, announced without any prior consultation in this year's budget, has already seen dramatic impacts on arts funding across Australia. It will directly affect small and medium arts organisations not just in the cities of our country but also in every region and every regional city. Those small and medium organisations are of course the lifeblood of arts activity in our country. It is those small and medium arts organisations that support individual artists. It is those small and medium arts organisations that feed through to the major performing arts groups the talent on which they rely in all aspects of their activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, it was no surprise that on Thursday of last week the Australia Council, having digested the impact on its activities of a cut of $105 million, announced that the six-year funding that has been worked on for many months by hundreds of organisations is now at an end and that the June funding round has been cancelled altogether. You can only imagine the disarray and the uncertainty. It is disarray that has been reported to me by arts organisations across the country, and all of them are now facing uncertainty as to their futures. It will be no surprise if, regrettably, many of those small and medium organisations actually go to the wall as a result of this foolish, destructive, short-sighted decision that has been taken without consultation by Senator Brandis and announced in this budgetâ€”and still, two weeks later, Senator Brandis has not explained what he proposes to do with the $105 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so this budget is of a piece with last year's. It persists with many of the cuts presented in the 2014 budget and resoundingly rejected by the community; and it introduces new cuts to parental leave, family payments and the arts, as well as other areas. Yet, in this budget, the government crawl away from the supposed justification for all of the cuts that they inflicted in 2014. You will hear no talk now, from this government, of 'debt and deficit disasters' or 'budget emergencies'; they would not dare. This is the government that has doubled the budget deficit to $35 billion. There is no pointing by this government now at some imagined wrongs done by the Labor government, which can now be seen to have managed the economy soundly over our six years of government. There will not be any pointing at the previous, Labor government, not without utter hypocrisy, because this is the government that has doubled the budget deficit to $35 billion on its watch. For a Prime Minister who promised a surplus in his first year in office and a surplus for every year of his first term, he has not even come close. He has abandoned that. At the end of the Labor government, the independently produced Pre-Election Fiscal Outlook had the federal budget returning to surplus this year, 2015-16. This budget, by contrast, first forecasts a surplus in 2019-20 and then only on the strength of some heroic economic assumptions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are too weak to take up the mantle of serious reform. They have produced a budget that focuses solely on their own short-term survival. They do not have the guts or the ambition to think seriously about the challenges Australia must address beyond the next election, let alone beyond the next decade. They have rejected the reasonable revenue measures proposed by Laborâ€”measures which would add $21 billion to the Commonwealth's balance sheet over the next decade. They are too short sighted to pursue reforms which are clearly necessary. It is clear that the current tax concession arrangements for superannuation are unsustainable, yet the government has rejected out of hand, without even reflecting on it, Labor's fair and responsible proposal for reform. It is clear that multinationals are not paying their fair share of tax currently, yet the government has rejected Labor's fully costed package of reforms to address this problem. So, this is a weak and unfair budget, but it is also an unimaginative budget, an unambitious budget. The Liberal government has no vision for the future of our country. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition, in his budget reply speech, charted a real vision for the future of this country. He addressed the challenges that will face our country as we transition out of the mining boom. Even in opposition, Labor have shown that we have a plan for our country to thrive in the next decade and in the decades beyond that. This Prime Minister, this Treasurer, this Abbott government, by contrast, have designed a budget aimed merely at surviving the next party-room meeting. The Australian people deserve much better than this government.</span>

                  <a href="72184" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:22</span>):  The bills before us encapsulate fair and reasonable measures to get a sound fiscal situation for our nation. I was going to talk about all the really great initiatives in the budget, but, before I proceed, I cannot let stand the fallacies I have heard from those opposite: that the deficit has doubled and that we have abandoned our stated aim to get our fiscal situation under control. With all due respect, people are ignoring MYEFO, which is independently produced by Treasury. It showed that the claim that the previous Treasurer had left a $17 billion deficit was utterly falseâ€”it was in the mid-40s. Our debt trajectory has been almost halved, from $667 billion, by some very hard decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who thinks that the figures that came from the previous Treasurer are correctâ€”the guru of magic pudding economics, or 'ouzo economics', as my colleague the member for Kooyong has so eloquently outlinedâ€”is deluding themselves. In his last budget, at the same time he said there was going to be a $17 deficit, the previous Treasurer said there was going to be surplus after surplus. Anyone who believes that is deluding themselves. MYEFO, not within a year or two of the coalition being given the responsibility of governing but within months, demonstrated that the deficit was actually closer to $45 billion; and we have reduced it considerably. And it would have been reduced even more if the Labor Party had not blocked $30 billion worth of projected savings, including $5 billion that they themselves had prosecuted when they were in government. It is absolute hypocrisy. I cannot believe that people would stand up and say this with a straight face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's budget is fair and reasonable. It is the latest step in getting a stronger economy and getting our books under control. For the last week I have been visiting many small businesses and I have not had anyone criticise the incredible incentives that are there for genuine small businessesâ€”a 1.5 per cent tax reduction for all ABNs and a five per cent tax reduction for unincorporated businesses with a ceiling of $1,000. Whether it is a trailer business, a benchtop business or a motorcycle business, they are all in unison. This is a great initiative. This will help us. There are a few businesses I visited who have a turnover of more than $2 million. They are not going to be the beneficiary of this directly, but they will benefit from it indirectly because most of their customers are the very businesses that this measure is targeted at. With small business doing well, large and medium sized businesses will do well as a consequence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of the agricultural sector in my electorate of Lyne qualifies for these initiatives too. Most family farms have a turnover of under $2 million. Accelerated depreciation for fencing, for water infrastructure and for silos and sheds is greatly appreciated because it will help them cope with drought by giving them the ability to store water in times of plenty for when there is not plenty of food and fodder. These are really good and sensible initiatives. Any business that takes up these initiatives will be doing it not just because it is an opportunity that is good for them; it still has to add up for their business. People are not going to spend money unless it is good for their business and allows it to grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget, funding continues for our newly announced Jobs Active program, including an expanded, reactivated and re-energised Work for the Dole program. This program will keep job seekers active and engaged in skill development and the workforce so that they do not transition to a life of long-term dependence on Newstart. All of the other initiatives in this space that have previously been announced will be funded going forward. These include the Restart program for middle aged people who have been unemployed and the relocation assistance grants. In the family space, the new childcare package will make most people who are earning between $60,000 and $120,000 roughly $30 better off every week of the year. That means child care, which will let them get into work or stay in work, will be better supported. We have changed from our previous proposal because what people wanted is childcare support. This budget is delivering a system that will deliver that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Lyne we have over $1 billion worth of road-building activity happening now, and this budget funds the second tranche of funds delivering that. In other areas of the state, north of the Lyne electorate, a 100-kilometre stretch of road is being funded by this budget. This is wonderful infrastructure that will link the Mid North Coast with the markets of Brisbane with a two-lane highway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I moved to the Lyne electorate over 23 years ago now. They were talking about the Pacific Highway being finished 23 years ago, and it is finally this Abbott coalition government that is actually delivering the goods on funding to the states on the 80/20 mix to make it happen rapidly. One only has to take a drive between Port Macquarie and Kempsey to see that it is virtually a continuous construction site for up to 30 kilometres. It is wonderful to see it: two bridges spanning the Hastings River, and then another bridge, a couple of bridges to span the Wilson River, and then up into Kempsey and the Macleay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is fundingâ€”the second tranche going forwardâ€”for the work on the Bucketts Way, which was one of my campaign commitments: $8 million each year for two years to Taree Council and Gloucester Council to deliver improvements to the surface of the Bucketts Way, a trade and tourism artery in that part of the Lyne electorate. Not only is that in this budget, but we have delivered $9.6 million for the Nabiac Sands aquifer project, which will deliver water security for the whole Great Lakes and Myall Lakes area as well as the Manningâ€”that is $9.6 million of really important infrastructure spending that will secure residential growth and industry growth in all those areas. Forster, Tuncurry, down towards Nabiac and in the Manning Valley, Wingham, Taree and Gloucester are all going to be benefiting from it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pension indexation has reverted back to the best of MTAWE or CPI. So, not only will the pension go up twice a year but it will go up, as most pensioners in my electorate wanted, by the best index available. We are delivering the goods for most pensioners. Pensioners who were on a part pension may even get more support where it is needed most, at the lower end of the scale. They are fair and reasonable, and if we are going to get our budget under control we have to control our spending, and that is what the members on the other side do not seem to understand. The previous speaker finished his dissertation based on fallacies. The deficit when the coalition was entrusted with the Treasury and the government benches was not $17 billion; it was $43 billion or $44 billion. I would have to check the exact number of billions, but it was vastly greater than what the previous Treasurer alluded to. Earlier speakers are still living in this fantasy world thinking they left here with only a $17 billion deficit. It is absolutely ridiculous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The medical research future fund is still a commitment from this coalition government. The money will not get there as quickly, but it will build to the $20 billion by 2023, out of savings through our general measures inside the Medicare Benefits Schedule review and other efficiencies. And, as the Prime Minister has said on many occasions, our greatest responsibility is to keep our nation secure, to keep citizens of Australia secure in their own home and in their own country. So we have allocated responsibly extra funds to the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Federal Police because of the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism and all sorts of terrorism. It is an ongoing feature of the world we live in now that there is this ugly, ugly phenomenon. An appropriate response is not to run the Australian Federal Police and the security forces down, like the previous government managed to do over the last few years of their tenure. We have actually increased it and got it back on a reasonable level so that they can deliver the security forces and capability that the nation requires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, all in all we have a families budget and we have a small business budget. It is encouraging businesses to have a go. I can only vouch for what I found in my own electorate in the last week. People really appreciate that they are out there putting their heart and soul into their small business. They have mortgaged their houses. They have worked like demons for 10, 15 or 20 years getting their family business up and they are seeing some tangible encouragement from their government, and they really appreciate it, because they are employing lots of people. When you are running a small business you get paid last, and your employees get paid first. That is an issue with small business, and to give them sensible, fiscally responsible help through accelerated depreciation and the tax benefits will increase their cash flow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very fair and reasonable budget. It has made the hard calls, and we are persisting with getting our budget under control so that the mortgage the nation has, which is our debt, gets back into the black. Our debt will take some time to pay off, and we can only do it if we get the deficit under control. The deficit is like the P&amp;L: when there is a deficit we are in the red. The previous government had deficit after deficit after deficit, for as far as the eye could see, and we have had to make the difficult decisions and turn it around. These budget papers put those decisions into effect, and I thoroughly commend them to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BIRD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:36</span>):  I want to take the opportunity in this cognate debate on the five appropriation bills to make some overall comment about the budget that has recently been brought down and to then talk specifically about my own region and how the budget impacts on us in Cunningham. I think the first thing we have to say about the budget is that it is quite clear that it is not actually a budget of a national government putting in place programs and funding to deliver a stronger future for Australia. In fact, it is really last year's budget. It has been repackaged. There has been an attempt to put some less worrisome aspects into it in order to prepare for an election period. It is very clear that it is a campaigning budget as the government go about attempting to draw all the attention and focus to what initiatives in the budget they hope will be well received in the community, ignoring the fact that it is fundamentally carrying forward everything from the previous budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget has also failed the government's own test that it set for it. It has failed to deliver on reduced tax, it actually has more debt and unemployment is predicted to be higher. In fact, it is predicted to peak at 6.5 per cent. At this point in time, what our nation actually needed was a vision for the future and a budget to deliver on it. That is far from what the nation has received. In fact, there is one future that I think is very much at the heart of this budgetâ€”and that is the Prime Minister's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast to that was the budget reply speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition, which put squarely in focus the challenges we as a nation face and the sorts of investments and considerations we need to be making to provide the jobs for the future, to put the foundation in place for the businesses of the future and to develop the skills and infrastructure we as a nation will need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why I feel the budget is so short-sighted is that it has clearly been structured with a short-term impact in mind. I say that because a number of new measures in the budget are funded for only two years. This includes the proposal for universal access to preschool, the small business accelerated depreciation program and the nannies program. These particular initiatives have been funded for only two years, so one can only suspect that the budget was targeted at getting through an election rather than laying the foundations for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget also fails the fairness test. The fairness test was very, very important for the previous budget. It was a spectacular achievement of unparalleled failure. We still see, however, that those things that caused us most concern in the last budget because of their intrinsically unfair impacts are still there in this budget. The $80 billion cut from schools and hospitals is still in place. In particular for me that is very frustrating because one of the most important reforms that I think was put in place by the previous Labor government was the Gonski funding reformsâ€”the funding model where, irrespective of the school sector that schools came from, it was based on need. That particular funding program was so well supported that all sectors of the education community supported it. State governments got on board. In fact, the government, who were then the opposition, said that they were on a unity ticket with Labor, that if you voted for the Liberal and National parties you would get exactly the same in school funding as you would have got under the Labor government. Quite clearly, that was not true.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We still have the proposal for $100,000 university degrees. Across the country, that has been soundly rejected by communities. People are very worried that the next generation will carry a debt forward that will be so heavy that it will prohibit them from doing things that as Australians we have taken for granted for many generations, such as buying your own home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last budget was a spectacular disaster, and initiatives from it are still in this budget. In particular, I want to talk about the cuts to family payments that were in the last budget. Those were not supported by the parliament. What we have in this budget is not just the continuation of banking those cuts to family payments; this budget has now taken them hostage and said that if people want the childcare changes proposed by the government, some of which the shadow minister has said we are keen to look at and which we understand may have positive benefits, they cannot have them unless there are significant and very damaging cuts to family payments. The budget has taken them hostage. We have not only had the unfairness previously; the government have now used that to hold hostage any other changes that might be of benefit to families. Again, the budget comprehensively fails the fairness test. The issue about the family payments is of particular concern in my electorate. I have had quite a lot of contact about this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to bring members' attention to the fact that the report which was the focus of much discussion in question time today that has been released by NATSEM has indicated that there is a significant hit to Australian families in the budget. The NATSEM research found that nine out of 10 of the lowest income families lose under the Abbott government's budget, while nine out of 10 of the wealthiest families benefit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Mr McCormack:</span>
                  </a>  Very reliable!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="DZP" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms BIRD:</span>
                  </a>  The member opposite does not think that is very reliable. I would draw his attention to the Prime Minister's own words where he said that NATSEM is one of the most authoritative research and reporting organisations in the country. It should not surprise us, I suppose, that the Prime Minister wants to have it one way when the argument suits him and then completely deny it the next day when it does not suit him. However, the research also shows that families will be slugged thousands of dollars even when the new childcare measures that are predicted to start in 2017 are factored in. So presuming that the government can get the childcare measures through the parliament, given that they have held them hostage to the family tax cuts, this particular modelling shows that they will not have a sufficient enough impact to provide real benefits to working families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The modelling in particular shows that: a family with a single income of $65,000 and two children would be $6,164 a year worse off by 2018-19; a single mother with an income of $55,000 and two children would be $6,107 a year worse off in the same time frame; and a family with a dual income of $60,000 and two children would be $3,843 a year worse off. When you combine the decision by the government in this budget to talk about child care reforms, hold them hostage to family tax benefits and proceed with those particular cuts, you can see why people in my area might be very concerned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Added to that, the government then did a complete backflip on it is paid parental leave position. Before the election, under the Labor government, for the first time ever we introduced a universal paid parental leave scheme in this country. Indeed, those opposite who will with us at the time voted for it. The main criticism that those opposite, now the government, made at the time was that it was not generous enough. The Prime Minister went out and said that he had had a road to Damascus conversion on paid parental leave, wanted to be its champion and wanted to introduce to even more generous scheme: his rolled-gold paid parental leave scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have now seen with this budget is that not only has the Prime Minister abandoned any attempt to prosecute his own paid parental leave scheme but he has now started to dismantle the universal scheme that Labor put in place and that he voted for at the time. In fact, the women of calibreâ€”as women were described by the Prime Minister when he was talking about his paid parental leave schemeâ€”have apparently now turned into double dippers, rorters and scammers. I think it is a real concern for many, many families out there when they are looking at the combination of all of these factors.</span>

We are seeing very savage cuts to these regional papers and to journalists who live in our communities and know our communities. They are very, very sadly being put in a position where the job loss is sad enough but they also know that for their community it is the loss of local stories and local voices as well. We currently face at circumstances the Illawarra. When I refer to articles, I am going to actually acknowledge the journalists and photographers. The photographers are also very significantly hit.

They talked to a Fairy Meadow mum. She was particularly concerned about the impacts of the announced decision on the paid parental leave. Fairy Meadow mum Lindsey Whitford had looked at the Joe Hockey's plan to crack down on paper parental leave and the so-called double dipping. She said that she was outraged. At present, parents can access the government's scheme for their base and then, if they are able to negotiate additional leave through their enterprise agreement, they can add on to that. By doing that, parents are creating a much more reasonable time frame of paid leave out of the workplace to raise their children. Under the planned changes, if you have an enterprise agreement based paid parental leave entitlement, you will lose the government one.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">"I just felt it was really unfair," she said. "For me, I work for a private company, it's not taxpayer-funded so it's not double dipping at all. It's actually an employer's way of hopefully retaining good employees and getting them to return to work."</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to say that in the Illawarra region as well we have been particularly hit by unemployment. Not long after the budget, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Illawarra Mercury</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>ran another story, written by Kate McIlwain, entitled 'Illawarra jobless figures hit a high'. Very sadly, the unemployment rate for the Illawarra had hit 9.4 per cent. That is up from 4.5 per cent only 12 months ago, in April of last year. For us, it is the issue of ongoing unemployment being above the national average. It is a significant and ongoing issue. It is particularly frustrating not to see anything in the budget to actually address the opportunity for investment in both skills and infrastructure in our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, while Labor was in government, there was $865 million invested in our region to support jobs, growth and investment. That included $135 million in capital works for the University of Wollongong, $13 million in new infrastructure and equipment for TAFEs, a record investment of $99.3 million in facilities for schools, $140 million for a steel adjustment package with BlueScope Steel and $75 million in funding to commence the Maldon-Dombarton rail link. We have seen nothing like thatâ€”in fact, absolutely nothing at allâ€”in either of the Abbott government's budgets for our region. That is creating serious concern for people across our area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On investing in skills, I obviously have a bias as the shadow minister for that area. But it is a really important thing to do. There has been $2 billion in skills funding cut from last year's budget and there is nothing new in this year's budget. It is an absolute failure to do what should be a really important task for a national government; that is, to invest in the skills and opportunities for education for the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="218019" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:51</span>):  It is with great pleasure that I speak on these appropriation bills, because there are some very exciting aspects to these bills, especially for my electorate of Page. I have mentioned it once or twice before in this chamber, but I certainly want to acknowledge in these appropriation bills the commitment that this government has made to the Pacific Highway. You may well be aware that one of the distinctions between us and the previous government at the last election was the difference in the commitment that we were making to the Pacific Highway. The previous government wanted to reverse its funding commitment to the Pacific Highway from 80 per cent federal and 20 per cent state back to fifty-fifty. This meant they were taking off the table over $2 billion of federal money to complete the duplication of the Pacific Highway. It was with great pleasure when, in my conversations with the then opposition Deputy Prime Minister, Warren Truss, we made an election commitment that, if elected as a coalition government, we would put that $2 billion back on the table. So the federal funds going towards the duplication of the Pacific Highway are actually over $5 billionâ€”not a large amount of moneyâ€”and when you add in the state contribution the total is over $7 billion. It is great to see that this commitment is in the budget and that it will happen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, as you would know, there are a number of aspects to this that are very important. The primary reason that we are doing this is for the safety of people driving on that road. Fatalities on the Pacific Highway are at low levels that we have not seen in decadesâ€”which is wonderful. When the duplication is completed that figure will even go lower, because statistically it is very well proven that when you have a duplication highway the fatalities drop enormously. That is obviously the main reason, but there are other side benefits. One of them is the construction activity that will be generated when you are building it and another is that post-construction there is the ease for transport, the ease of travel, and the advantages that that brings to those areas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news for my community is that the major section that is not completed is between Ballina in the north and Woolgoolga in the south. It is a stretch of about 155 kilometres and a lot of that is in my electorate. As the work on that is about to begin, there will be up to 4,000 people who will be employed directly in the construction phase of this. When you add in the indirect jobsâ€”as we know, there is a multiple that is created when you have direct jobsâ€”there will be over 10,000 jobs created. The people who are working on the highway need to eat somewhere, they need to sleep somewhere, they need to have their haircut and they need to do everything else that they do at home. So the indirect jobs that it will create are enormousâ€”let alone the quarries, the truck transport and all the associated things that go into that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not an engineer but I know that there are some enormous engineering feats that are going to have to be undertaken, such as the Harwood Bridge over the Clarence River. I do not know if you have seen the Clarence River, Deputy Speaker, but it is a pretty impressive river. That bridge alone is going to cost in the multiple-hundreds-of-millions of dollars to complete and it will be a major engineering feat on its own as one small section of that highway. Last month I had the absolute pleasure of having the Deputy Prime Minister, Warren Truss, in the electorate, and we announced that Pacific Complete had won the tender to complete this last section of the highway. As a small part of this project, Pacific Complete are going to base themselves in Grafton and they will immediately need almost 80 people to be put into an office block in Grafton to start to coordinate and administer this scheme. At their peak, they think they will have 200 people working in their head office in Grafton administering this multibillion dollar program. The day the Deputy Prime Minister visited I organised what we call the Clarence Valley Ready to Work Forum, after we announced that Pacific Complete had won the tender. We had a great turnout. What I wanted to do was to have our community leverage off this. We want local companies to win tenders and we want to leverage every cent possible that is spent constructing this highway to be retained in our local community Very importantly, post-construction of this highway, we want to envisage where our community will be post-2020â€”what type of community, what type of infrastructure will be built in parallel with this highway so that we can keep growing and moving on afterwards. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge some of the people who came to that forum. The Grafton Chamber of Commerce, some real estate agents, the Mayor and some staff from the Clarence Valley council and the New South Wales Business Chamber were there. John Murray, the head of that organisation in our region, and everyone who attended the forum came up with some great suggestions and great practical things that we can do to make sure we leverage this right. Others who attended were C-BEASâ€”a local business incubatorâ€”NORTEC, Epic Employment and some training providers and some employment and job service providers. They can tell us how we can educate our people and what skills they need so that they can be the people who get the type of jobs that we need for this project. They were there giving us their ideas as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is obviously not just the Clarence Valley, though; this highway is going to move directly through or just bypass communities such as Yamba and Iluka, Weddell, Broadwater, Woodburn and many others. I am working with all these communities on how we do this and how we leverage this for all the communities along the route and obviously the ones off it not only during construction but post-construction as well. It is a very exciting part of the appropriation bills that we are talking about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that struck me about this budget and these appropriation bills was the small business package, which, Mr Deputy Speaker, I know you would be aware of. There are over 10,000 small businesses, as there are in every electorate. Every time someone gets up and talks about small business in their community, they will mention a figure somewhere in excess of 10,000. We know that small businesses are the biggest employer in our country. They are the lifeblood of commerce, especially in many rural and regional areas. If there is one projection that I think might be wrong in the budget, it is the amount that we think this $20,000 deduction or write-off of taxable income for capital investments in our businesses. In fact, that night I had some businesses from my community here in Parliament House and they were telling me that that was fantastic news. I had two or three unsolicited calls the next day from people who said: 'Kevin, that is the best thing that we have heard in a budget for many, many years.' Like everyone in this chamber, last week I had the absolute pleasure of being home in my community, and every day people were telling me that already they had started to invest money. I spoke to many, whether they were IT companies, hardware stores or machinery companies, who had orders on their books that were looking very promising because of this initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The one thing that this side of politics gets is that every public sector dollar, every taxpayer dollar, that you want to spend on many worthy causes has to come from a healthy private sector. This measure, combined with the tax cuts that we also gave small businessâ€”which means that small businesses now have the lowest tax rate in 50 yearsâ€”is again a matter of us walking our talk. We say that we are the political parties for small business and we are walking the talk through this $20,000 write-off and the cut in the company tax rate for small businesses. This will improve cash flow. We have also, though not necessarily as part of these bills, got on with reducing red tape for small businesses. Already there is anecdotal evidence that small business is going to be driving this economy forward in the next 12 months because of this budget and this appropriation bill initiative. I applaud it and know it is going to be a great success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my maiden speech I made much of the Australian colloquialism 'have a go'. We encourage everyone in this country to have a go, because this country has been built on the have a go philosophy. It is essential if we want to succeed as a country and if we want to succeed as individuals. And how do we talk to our children? For those of us who are lucky enough to be parents, what is the one thing that we want to encourage in our own children? If they have a dream or if they want to do something in life, what is the one thing we tell them? As good parents, as good mentors, we tell them to have a go. This budget is about that same philosophyâ€”we want small business people and everyone in this country to have a go so that they can succeed and, by default, the country can succeed so there is more employment and the benefits that go with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know my local councils are very happy with the doubling of the Roads to Recovery funding in this 12-month period. Almost $9 million will be going to the five local councils in my area. Ballina is getting over $1 million, Clarence Valley nearly $3 million, Kyogle $1Â½ million, Lismore nearly $2 million and Richmond Valley nearly $1Â½ million in specific funds through Roads to Recovery. Again, it was very much a Nationals initiative a number of governments ago to allocate federal funding to local councils because those of us who live in rural and regional Australia know the importance of that infrastructure. This is on top of Black Spot funding, and I recently announced almost $3 million of funding to fix seven dangerous black spots on local roads across my community. We know that targeting dangerous roads saves livesâ€”much like the duplication of the highway, it is safer for motorists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to finish on the philosophy of the budget. There is much made of spending and there is much made of income when we debate these issues. There is not one politician, not just in this chamber but in any level of government across this country, who does not want to spend money. Spending money is nice for a politician; it is a very easy thing to do because of the pats on the back you get from where that money goes. But a budget always has to be crafted with balanceâ€”we need our economy to grow. If we are going to spend money, we need to get the money from somewhere. As I continually say, governments do not create moneyâ€”we are simply a redistributor of money. We are taking money from someone and giving it to someone else. While we always like to fund government programs and public programs to the best of our ability, we have to be conscious that we have to physically take that money from someone else and that someone else is the private sector. We have to make sure they are flourishing, because if we take too much from them they will become noncompetitive. A lot of businesses have global competitors now, especially with the internet, and everyone is competing at some level, no matter what their business, on a global scale. We have to be very conscious of that as well and we have to get the balance right. We are fostering the private sector, almost like a small child, to make sure they grow each year and have the conditions in which to survive and flourish. That can obviously then feed into the public sector. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk about sustainabilityâ€”we talk about sustainability in the environmental field; we talk about sustainability in lots of different areas. We have to be sustainable economically, as much as that might mean that sometimes we do not spend as much money as we would like. Especially in recent times, some European countries are having imposed on them some quite stringent controls because they are in a state that is not sustainable. While we would always like to give more, we have to act the same as we do with our own family budgetsâ€”what can we afford, what can we do, how can we protect our income flows while also looking after those areas that we should. We should, as a government, look after those who need support and government money. I commend the bills to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="30540" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRODTMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:06</span>):  The appropriation bills reflect the changes made in the 2015-16 budget. And what a budget it is. It is a budget that preaches spending, even though just 12 months ago Australia was facing a budget emergency. It is a budget that sees tax up, spending at global financial crisis levels, the deficit doubled and growth projections bordering on the heroic. It is a budget that repackages all the unfair elements of last year's budget. The $80 billion in cuts to schools and hospitals remains. The $600 million cut to ACT health funding remains. The $100,000 university degrees remain. The cuts to family payments remain. The GP tax by stealth remains. The $125.6 million cuts to child dental services have now been introduced, and there is another $1 million cut for the seatbelts in school buses. We have seen new modelling from NATSEM and ACOSS that shows the poorest Australian families will be hit by this budget. Nine out of 10 of the poorest families with children will lose out under the budget, while nine in 10 of the richest with children will benefit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the core of this budget is the unfairness of last year's absolute stinker of a budget, and, true to form, it is a budget that attacks Canberra and the Public Service. What does this mean for Canberra? Put simply, this budget is just bad newsâ€”continued bad newsâ€”for Canberra. Eight federal government departments have been earmarked for functional reviews, including the Department of the Environment, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Social Services, the Attorney-General's Department and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as well as the Australian Taxation Office. We all know that 'functional reviews' are essentially code for even more job cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Film and Sound Archive, the National Archives, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Library and the National Museum of Australia will also see more jobs go, and they are all pretty much lean and mean already, so I do not know where these jobs are going to come from. It is definitely going to affect the services that these cultural institutions provide to the nation. The National Gallery of Australia will also lose $400,000 over the next four years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Federal Police will lose $220 million by 2017-18 as well as more than 100 jobs. They will go. The Bureau of Meteorology will lose 102 jobs. And the Department of Defence will lose a further 1,150 jobs. That is on top of the 2,400 Defence civilian jobs already axed since the Abbott government came to office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just wonder how many of those opposite in the chamber here tonight would feel if they had had 8,500 jobs ripped from their electorate since this government was elected. Eight thousand, five hundred Public Service jobs in Canberra have gone since this government was elected in 2013. That adds to a total of 17,300 Public Service jobs across Australia that have been axed by this government since it came into power. That also includes close to 10,000 jobs in 2014-15 alone, which is a 5.6 per cent cut to the public sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only are the public servants, these proud servants of democracy, fearing job cuts; the government's campaign to reduce their pay and conditions continues. Protected industrial action is underway at a large number of federal departments including the Bureau of Meteorology, Agriculture, Defence, Veterans' Affairs and even the employment minister's own department.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Canberrans have had a gutful, and I have had a gutful. I have had a gutful of the sustained attack on the proud people who serve our nation. I have had a gutful of the plans to relocate agencies to centres outside our nation's capital, despite Sir Robert Menzies's vision for Canberra: to 'build up Canberra as a capital in the eyes and minds of the Australian people'. I have had a gutful of public servants being described as 'rorters' and 'double dippers' and 'fraudsters' and treated as costs rather than people with families and mortgages and car loans and hopes and dreams like every other Australian. I have had a gutful of the Abbott government's demonisation of its own workforce. And I have had a gutful of the government's sustained attack on the integrity of the people who serve our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was absolutely astonishing to see the Prime Minister, almost two weeks ago, accuse hardworking public servants who had accessed the government's Paid Parental Leave scheme as well as their own workplace scheme of doing wrong, of rorting, of committing fraudâ€”it was suggested that they had committed fraudâ€”of double dipping. The fact of the matter is that the Abbott government's change to Paid Parental Leave will leave thousands of Canberra women, and 80,000 across Australia, worse off. That includes public servants. That includes Australian Defence Force and Australian Federal Police personnel, teachers, nurses, private sector workers and anyone on an employer funded scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to their pay and conditions being continually attacked, in addition to their reputations being constantly sullied by this government, in addition to the jobs being cutâ€”17,300 since this government was elected, with 8Â½ thousand here in the ACT aloneâ€”I am tired, as are public servants themselves, of public servants being constantly berated and used as political pawns by this government. I would like to read from an email I received in the last week from a public servant in my electorate. To ensure that her identity is protected, I will only use her first name, because so many public servants are afraid to speak out at the moment for fear of losing their job. The environment is particularly toxic here in terms of job security, and people are frightened about speaking out against this government's sustained attacks on the Public Service, the sustained attacks on its integrity, the sustained attacks on their job security and the sustained attacks on them as individuals and the pay and conditions that they have fought so hard for over many years. They are frightened. They are frightened to speak out. So, in reading this email from one of my constituents, I will only use her first name out of fear that she will be hindered professionally. Alex has written to me:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I did really want to talk to you about how frustrating it is to be a public servant at the moment. I know we're supposed to be politically neutral but we're also effectively gagged. It's a horrible feeling to go to work every day and have zero respect for your 'big boss' and his leadership team. I feel like I'm able to see both sides of the story most of the time, but the way the government constantly lambasts us and publicly disrespects us (particularly women!) is both mortifying and infuriating when we can't stand up for ourselves. I know I'm not the only public servant who feels disempowered in this way, but what can we do short of joining the union (which I've done)? Any sage advice gladly received â€¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the story across the board here in Canberra. I will now read from another email, also received in the last week. Again, I will mention the person's first name only, to protect their identity. This is from Kelly:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">l am a public servant, have always been proud of my role. The current pressures and job cuts are destroying me and everyone around me. We work incredibly long hours, under enormous pressure. The demands continue and the resources continue to be cut. The lack of job certainty and career prospects breeds a toxic environment of fear and back stabbing. This is unsustainable. Yet, the job market outside of govt is also strained and employment is hard to find. This govt is having the worst impact on society that I have seen in my adult life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And another, received today:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I too have had a gutful of the Abbott Government's attack on the Public Service and the lower end of town. When I was a Public Servant I suffered under the Howard Government's attack and was given the big push back in '89. Fortunately at that time both my children were working and my wife still had a job so the stress of losing my job was not a major problem. But my Daughter does work for the Dept of Health, has 2 daughters in High School and is the major bread winner in their family and my wife and I worry about the prospects of her losing her job under the reign of Captain Tony.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eight and a half thousand Canberrans have been sacked by this government, and thousands of others now have little to no job security and certainty. These are the people that defend our nation and that secure our borders. These are the people that educate our children, that care for us when we are sick, that keep us safe at night and that support us when times are tough. These are the people that advance our interests overseas, that research, develop, implement and communicate the government's policies, that brief the government, that write its submissions, that prepare the government for question time. These are our proud servants of democracy, and their treatment by this government is appalling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I went into business, I was a public servant. Before I came into this life I had my own business, and before that I was a proud public servant. Like all public servants, I joined the Public Service to make a difference and improve the lives of Australians. Public servants in Canberra and right across the country sign up to make a difference to their country and to improve the lives of Australians. I was immensely proud of the work I did in policy making, in communication, in researching and writing submissions and briefs, in representing our country overseas. Like Alex and Kelly, I took my job seriously, because, as I said, it was about making a difference to our nation and improving the lives of Australians. And, like the 17,300 public servants who have lost their job since this government was elected, in 1996 I also lost my job. That was when the last coalition government was in. The coalition has form on the Public Service. It has complete disdain for the Public Service, for Canberra, the nation's capital, and for Sir Robert Menzies's vision for the capital. It has complete disdain for these people who work to ensure that the government can achieve its goals, who take their job seriously, who treat it professionally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, coalition governments have form. Back in 1996 the coalition government promised to get rid of 2,500 Public Service jobs through natural attrition. That ended up being 15,000 jobs here in Canberra and 30,000 jobs nationally. The impact on Canberra was extraordinary. It was phenomenal. It was frightening. People left town. We went into an economic slump for five years. House prices plummeted and businesses went under. Bankruptcies, both business and nonbusiness, went up to historic levels. Our population fell. Our local shops closed down. It had a devastating effect. If 15,000 jobs are taken from one city, it cannot but help have a devastating effect on the city. That was then. It took five years for Canberra to get out of that slump. During that time, not only were those jobs cut, including mine, but the Public Service and Canberra were completely derided, denigrated and demonised by a coalition government. We are seeing all that repeated now by this governmentâ€”demonisation,  derision and denigration of the Public Service, of the proud servants of democracy, of the people who serve our nation, of our nation's capital, Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had an absolute gutful of the way that coalition governments use Canberra as a political punching bag. Shame on you. Shame on you for what you do to this capital every time you get into government. I want Canberrans and public servants to know that they may feel as if they are gagged, and I know that they do. We have heard those letters from Alex and Kelly. I want Canberrans and public servants to know that I am listening. I hear your concerns. I will stand up to you. I will defend you when the Prime Minister denigrates you, when he derides you, when he demonises you and when you are accusedâ€”to use his own wordsâ€”of being a rorter, a fraudster and a double-dipper. I will defend the important work that you do every single day. I will defend your pay and conditions. I will defend you, the proud servants of democracy, and I will defend this city, our nation's capital, that I love. I will defend it from this terrible government and this terrible budget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:21</span>):  I would like to start off on a different note to that where the member for Canberra left off. I am excited about this budget. I would like to start by thanking the Treasurer for delivering a budget that does not benefit certain sections of the community, but benefits all Australians. If we have a strong small business sector, we have a strong economy and then all Australians benefit. Keep in mind that small business employs the bulk of our workforce and, without them profiting, we will go nowhere. That has been the case for the last few years. We lacked confidence in the business sector and in employing more Australians; we lacked confidence in the overall theme of getting up and having a go. I feel that this budget will turn that around immensely. I congratulate the Treasurer for putting in place the mechanism so that business will have a go to get the country going once again.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many initiatives in this budget that directly affect my electorate. Flynn has a large population of small business owners. We have fly-in workers and we have farmers. I would specifically like to congratulate the Treasurer on his attitude towards these groups and for allocating a large portion of the budget to improving infrastructure in regional areas. This current government will attend to roads and rail. In my electorate alone, there is about 400 kilometres of the Bruce Highway. This week more passing lanes and the elimination of more black spots were announced. The general surface of the road is also to improve. We now have the ability to put a white strip a metre wide down the middle of our highway to keep the cars separated. That is in place of a white strip that was four inches wide that allowed 20-tonne or 60-tonne trucks to come within two feet of a small car. This is how we are improving our highways. Having a dividing line up the middle of the Bruce Highway is a step in the right direction. When trucks are coming at each other and all they need is a bump in the road to throw the truck or the trailer across the path of the other vehicle and this is where accidents happen. The road toll is already coming down because of improved roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Any business with a turnover of $2 million will have the ability to write off their purchases of less than $20,000. This is a great thing for business. It reminds me of the time back in the 1980s, when I was in business, and under the Fraser and Hawke governments there was an investment allowance, which allowed a 40 per cent write-off on any particular business item you had to purchase. This was very good for the economy back in the 80s, but unfortunately it was whittled down to nothing. I say this is a similar projectâ€”it worked then, and there is no reason it should not work now. For businesses that are not incorporated, instead of 1.5 per cent decrease in tax, they will have five per cent that they can write off to reduce their tax. You can either have one and a half per cent lessâ€”back to 28.5 per cent taxâ€”or write off the five per cent if you are unincorporated. This has got to be good for business. There is no doubt about that and, with the money saved there, they can invest in equipment and more staff. They can develop their business to a point where they make more money and, if they make more money, then the government makes more money. It is a very simple philosophy that the Treasurer has employed. He wants to see vibrant businesses so that we reduce Work for the Dole; we get people off the dole into the workforce and it comes together nicely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is, of course, $1.8 billion in savings over the next four years but this will go to deserving people, and there will be more money for people to join in with the workers. There is no substitute for working to do away with a lot of ills of today's society. The zone tax allowance, which was offered in the past to people who, say, lived in Brisbane but worked in Emerald in the coalfields, has been removed. That has to be good, too. I want to see people who work in Emerald live in Emerald, because that helps our hospital systems and our general community in places like Blackwater and Biloela. That is a move in the right direction. If you work in the coalfields or the gasfields or on properties in your own area, that is where you live and where you bring up your family. We want to encourage people to come back to live in the towns where they work. When there are doctors who reside in towns, that makes for a very strong health system. When you have to rely on locums in these small townsâ€”fly in, fly out doctors who could come from anywhere in Australia or New Zealandâ€”it does not add to the strength of the health committees who work diligently. All it does is set up two sorts of doctors. One is a local who struggles; he has a building; he has permanent staff. The other is a locum. He tends to fly in, get paid a set amount for a day's workâ€”which is sometimes about $2,500â€”and then fly out with no care and no responsibility. It is then left up to the local doctors to fill the short gaps when he is not there. So having this zonal tax offset taken away is going to be good for regional towns in my electorate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we go on, the drought package that has been offered to farmers is very welcome. Whilst the drought does not have a stranglehold in my electorate, it does just to the west in places like Maranoa. There are about 24 shire areas in Queensland and four in New South Wales that are in dire straits; in some places, it has not rained for four years. These particular people are still in there, hanging on. They have sold a lot of their livestock off. Some are hanging on to a few breeders in order to get going again when the rains come, and they will come some day, but they need something to start from. The price of cattle, in the areas that have rain, has actually gone up, and that is probably because of our free trade agreements. The demand for our beef in Central Queensland is rising all the time. There are about 16 foreign countries looking to Australia to supply them with beef as they become more affluent in their own living standards. They are looking at places like Australia, and Central Queensland, to provide them with red meat. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As they have had such a tough time, a lot of these farmers and graziers have not had a turnover of $2 million, and they will benefit immensely from these new tax arrangements. I might add that the buying of assets under $20,000 comes under three financial years: the remainder of this year, then next year, and then the year ending 30 June 2017. So there are a two and a bit years to buy your goods and assets, and that starts as of budget night last week. The opportunity is there for small business to get out and take advantage of what the government has offered. I do hope that they are in a situation where they have a taxable income and can use these benefits over the next two years and two months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget, overall, is very good. You will see the black spots on our major highways disappear. You will see the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program launched. For instance, the Emerald to Clermont road is going to have a $25 million upgrade. There will be work on the black spot at Benaraby, on the Bruce Highway just outside Gladstone. It is a good program. It is a problem area that I have nominated on the highway for a long time, and it is great to see that come off. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, we delivered a tough but necessary budget for the times. No-one likes to have a budget deficit year after year after year. Our government was trying to rein it in.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:36</span>):  One thing is for sure: the government has no idea how bad this budget is. They are doubling the deficit and unemployment is going up, and I find it extraordinary that the member for Flynn clearly has not read the budget papers, where that is clearly set out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking back on it now, a year after last year's horror budget, you have to realise that very little has actually changed. A year ago I said the Abbott government's first budget confirmed:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the worst for all Australians who believe in a fair, tolerant and compassionate Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A year on, the Abbott government's second budget confirms that unfairness is still at the very heart of this Liberal government. Nowhere is this more clear than in the Abbott government's approach to families. Just three days before this year's budget, the Prime Minister said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We know it will be good for families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before that, just a few months ago, the Prime Minister said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We, the coalition government, are not going to repair our budget this year at the expense of your family budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These were the assurances that the Prime Minister gave Australian families in the lead-up to the second budget. Then, on budget night, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer handed down a budget that includes the same massive cuts to family tax benefits that were in last year's budgetâ€”kicking families off family tax benefit part B when their youngest child turns six, freezes to the rates of family tax benefits. Labor understands just how devastating this government's cuts are to families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">New research from NATSEM confirms the worst for families already battling to make ends meet. I will give you a couple of examples. A single-income family, where one of the parents is working, on $65,000 a year, with two school-age children, will lose over $6,000 a year. I ask each of the government members in the parliament today: have you been out and told those single-income families in your electorates that your government is going to take $6,000 off them? Because that is exactly what you will be voting for. That is around 10 per cent of their entire family budget that this Liberal government wants to take off those families. The cumulative financial impact on these families is enormous. Another example is a single-parent family, where the parent is working, with two childrenâ€”one in primary school, one in secondary schoolâ€”with an income of $55,000. That parent will lose $6,000 a year, each and every year, by 2018-19. These losses will increase every year. It is abundantly clear that this year's budget is just as unfair on Australian families as last year's horror budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just the NATSEM modelling that supports this argument. Professor Peter Whiteford from the ANU said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So overall, the Budget proposals would take far more out of assistance for families than it puts in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over this weekend we saw new analysis from the Australian Council of Social Service showing that $15 billion will be stripped from Australian families because of this government's unfair budget. This is what this government wants to take straight out of the pockets of families. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Social Services have not come clean with their own modelling. I have asked again and again for the government to present their own modelling of the impact of the government's changes on familiesâ€”and they refuse. This budget means that families will be worse off. Labor will continue to oppose these unfair cuts to family tax benefits, as we have over the last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The attack on families is not limited to cuts to family tax benefits. This year's budget includes, quite extraordinarily, cuts to paid parental leaveâ€”cuts that will leave 80,000 new mothers worse off; cuts that will see new parents forced back into the workforce earlier. In the mother of all insults, the Treasurer announced these cuts to paid parental leave on Mother's Day! The Treasurer agreed that it is, according to Laurie Oakes's question, 'fraud' if women take paid parental leave from their employer and the government scheme. The Minister for Social Services described women claiming both employer and government paid parental leave as being part of a 'rort'. The Treasurer and the wannabe Treasurer, the Minister for Social Services, also approved the use of that appalling languageâ€”it is actually in the budget papersâ€”of 'double dipping'. All of the ministers on the ERC, including the Assistant Treasurer, who is at the table, approved the use of this language. The torrent of scorn following this decision has been unrelenting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen businesses come out and criticise the cuts to paid parental leave, saying that the cuts will undermine their own schemes to support parents. The chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry indicated that employers would shift payments to other benefits. Kate Carnell said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's hard to see why employers would continue to pay parental leave if it meant the government stopped paying and they were simply footing the bill for the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is exactly what the government said it would not do, according to the previous Minister for Social Services. But you cannot believe anything these people opposite say, especially on family payments or paid parental leave. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The criticism has not just come from business. Unions have been strong in their condemnation of the government's cuts to paid parental leave as well. Ged Kearney from the ACTU said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There's an early agreement that employers and the unions will get together and discuss how this can be changed. â€¦ It just won't work the way it has been announced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been criticism as well from the government's own backbench. Last week the member for Murray urged the government to go 'back to the drawing board' on paid parental leave. As the member for Murray said: as a result of these cuts, women had been left with 'the worst of all worlds'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most appalling behaviour in this whole saga has come from the Prime Minister himself. This was the man who said, quite a few years ago now, that paid parental leave would happen in this country over his dead body. Then all of you opposite went to the last election and the one before that saying that you would deliver a gold-plated paid parental leave scheme that would have given $75,000 a year to wealthy women. That was the policy you took to the last election. Mr Abbott likened his paid parental leave scheme to his Nixon-going-to-China moment. That is what he said. Of course, he eventually dumped that unaffordable and unfair scheme. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, in this budget, the Prime Minister has a third view. He has decided to cut paid parental leave to around 80,000 new mothers because, apparently, the scheme that he once mocked as being inadequate is all of a sudden too generous. So now he wants to cut $1 billion from paid parental leave. That is what is in this budget. Australian families now know beyond any doubt that they cannot believe a single word that this Prime Minister says. He has taken three different views to different elections, and now we have the view in this budget. This Prime Minister has absolutely no credibility when it comes to Australian families, and Labor will firmly oppose this government's cuts to paid parental leave, as well as the cuts to family tax benefits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You might be surprised to know that there are a couple of things in this bill that I do welcome and do support. I do welcome the continued rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme that will see, in total, 460,000 Australians with disability getting the care and support that they need and deserve. We were pleased to see the money for this scheme, particularly to see funded, in the bill we are currently debating, a new ICT system to support the NDIS. I am also very pleased to see the continued funding of many microfinance initiatives that were established by the previous, Labor government, as of course the National Disability Insurance Scheme was. These microfinance initiatives have been very important in helping people, particularly those trying to get out of poverty, to start little businesses, or helping with their education, and it is a very positive thing to see that in this bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to pensions, however, I am very, very concerned. It is true that, after a year of relentless campaigning by pensioners and by Labor members right around Australia, we have shamed this government into scrapping its unfair cuts to pension indexation for now, cuts to the pension that would have seen pensioners cop an $80 a week cut to their pension over the next decade. Each and every one of the members opposite, Liberal and National party members, voted for that cut, and we will certainly be reminding each and every one of your electors in the lead-up to the next election that you voted for a cut to pension indexation. Of course, this is the Prime Minister that said there would be no changes to pensions, so pensioners were understandably extraordinarily angry about that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor opposed these cuts the night they were announced in last year's budget and we opposed them because we knew that cuts to pension indexation were fundamentally unfair. For a year, the Prime Minister, in question time after question time, kept repeating that pensions were not going to be cut, that pensions would keep going up and up. But Australian pensioners are smarter than thatâ€”</span>

                  </a>  I am glad to hear the member for Flynn is still defending them! Keep going! Go out there and tell that to your pensioners, because one thing is for sure: pensioners are not fooled. They are not fooled by the member for Flynn and they are not fooled by the Prime Minister. They know how important it is to have a fair indexation rate. The pension is benchmarked to wages for a reason. It is so that pensioners' standard of living actually keeps pace with the standard of living of the working population more broadly, and governments of both political persuasions have understood this in the past. John Howard understood it; the former, Labor government understood itâ€”but not this Liberal government. It was $23 billion that you wanted to take out of the pockets of pensioners, and none of you can deny it. That is what last year's budget would have done. We know that this fight is not over and we will continue to remind pensioners that this is what you really want to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government wants to increase the age pension age to 70 and still wants to stand by its $1.3 billion in cuts to concessions for pensioners and seniors. And so the list goes on. There are more cuts to pensions in this year's budget which we will need to consider very, very carefully to make sure that whatever this government comes up with meets the fairness test.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish on what this government wants to do to the young employed, because there was nothing crueller than that in last year's budget, when each Liberal and National party member wanted to leave young unemployed people with absolutely nothing to live on for six months. They have changed that now; they just want to leave young unemployed people with nothing to live on for one month! For one month, you want to leave them with nothing to live on. I can tell you that we will not be supporting this punitive measure, which is patently unfair. We need to help young Australians into work, not leave them homeless and with absolutely nothing to eat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government cannot be trusted. Families know they cannot trust this government, pensioners know they cannot trust this government and young Australians know that they cannot trust this government. Australians know that, every time this government looks for a change in its budget, it will be unfair.</span>

Whilst I am pleased to be able to make a contribution tonight, it was very tough to sit through the one from the member for Jagga Jagga. We have the member for Rankin here, who was more than happy to jump in with an interjection at any time. I am sure, if they want to come up to my electorate, they would find out about living in the real world, and that is that in regional Queensland things are fairly tough. Certainly, the important thing for people in my electorate is creating jobs: creating employment and providing opportunities for our youth. That is what they want us to do and that is what we are getting on with. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a good budget for business confidence, and I will give you really simple example. On the weekend, I went into one of the local gas providers and had a bit of a chat with the owner-operator, who said he had been doing it relatively tough. He had two staff he was considering retrenching because he simply did not have enough work. In the last two weeks, he has been absolutely flat out and, last week, he had a record weekâ€”in a business that has been in place for four years. Business is starting to pick up. The economy is strengthening. Confidence is what is important, and it is on the way up as well. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is important that we, as elected members of electorates across Australia, have a vision for our electorate. For me, that is an electorate where our economy is strong and resilient, an electorate where we can produce jobs for our youth. There are a number of projects on the listâ€”certainly on my wish list, on the whiteboard and everywhere elseâ€”that we are trying to get over the line. The first one is the provision of a dive wreck at Hervey Bay. HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Tobruk</span> is one of the Navy's great vessels which has been in service for many years. It was in Vanuatu not that long ago to provide relief to the people of Vanuatu. However, it is coming to the end of its useful life. In Hervey Bay, where we have a very strong recreational dive group and a very strong whaling group, we have all the infrastructure we require to expand. HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Brisbane</span>, when it was sunk at Caloundra, lifted the local economy by some $5 million a yearâ€”$5 million worth of economic activity. The beautiful waters of Hervey Bay are warm all year roundâ€”and the sharks are certainly not that bad. I know we have competition. I know of a number of other areas that would like HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Tobruk</span> for a dive wreck. But the water in the south is very cold and very deepâ€”and, I am sure, full of Noahs. However, in Hervey Bay we have the infrastructure to make use of a vessel like HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Tobruk</span>. I am very pleased that a local group has got together to put together all of the technical details for an application. We are working with our local councils, including the Bundaberg Regional Council and the Fraser Coast Regional Council. Like all things, there are always arguments about location: 'Location, location, location! Where should we put the vessel?'</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PITT:</span>
                  </a>  The suggestion from the floor is the Logan River. Unfortunately, the Logan River is full of all sorts of other things! I would like to thank Nicky Shulz, from Urangan Fisheries, for the advice that he has given to the group. He has identified a spot where the tide speed is only 1Â½ knots maximum, which would mean you could dive on this wreck all day and all night long. It is an opportunity for my region which will build jobs; it will provide additional people who can actually work. They can get out and do a job every single day and look after themselves without support from government. Certainly HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Tobruk</span> has got strong ties to the Bundaberg region. We have the Rats of Tobruk Memorial in Bundaberg. There is a very strong group that looks after the memorial up there, which is, of course, a replica of the original Rats of Tobruk Memorial. So it is important that we look to the future. If that opportunity comes up, I would like to encourage the Minister for Defence to consider my electorate as the No. 1 location where we could put the ship. It could go on to serve the people of Australia as a dive wreck and tourist attraction for the rest of its life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, under the Stronger Regions program, we missed out on an application for Bundaberg Regional Council. However, like all applications, you need to meet the criteria. The difficulty was that the application was put in under the previous state government, with support. The Stronger Regions Fund requires 50 per cent as a co-contribution on top of what is asked for from the federal government. Unfortunately, the change to a Labor state government meant that that other part of that funding was not forthcoming. So we only had 30 per cent in the tin, which, of course, meant the project was ineligible. That was very disappointing. However, this is what happens when you change to a Labor government: you miss out on infrastructure projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I congratulate them on making a good decision to maintain the gas infrastructure project in Bundaberg. By 2017 we will have a gas line that runs into the Bundaberg port. It will support industry and create jobs. We already have a commitment from a company called Knauf Australia to build a $70 billion plasterboard manufacturing plant at Port Bundaberg. That will create some 200 jobs in construction and some 65 permanent positions, and it will, of course, add to our GDP. Knauf have told me they will also build a pelletising plant so that we can use gypsum from that plant in our agricultural endeavours. For those of you who know the Bundaberg region, Wide Bay is one of the largest horticultural producing areas of Australia. We are the biggest producer of heavy vegetables in this country, so to have someone who can facilitate the direct import of lime into a pelletised product for our farmers to use at a much reduced cost will, of course, lift farm-gate returns. That will make people more viable and hence they can employ more people, which is exactly what we need in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As always, the other big issue in regional Australia is roads. This government has committed $6.7 billion towards the Bruce Highway, some $500 million of which is available in 2015-16. I thank the Minister for Infrastructure, Warren Truss, who is, of course, the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Nationals. A lot of work has already been undertaken in my electorate. We have completed the Goodwood-Childers Road intersection. We have completed overtaking lanes to the north of Howard. Work on overtaking lanes to the south is underway. There has been work at Booyal and Aldershot. I do not have as much highway in my electorate as the member for Flynn has in his, but it is in much better condition than it was under the previous federal Labor government. We are getting on with the job. We need the Bruce Highway to be open regardless of the weather conditions so that we can provide produce from our electorate to the people of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and everywhere else. So I am very pleased that we are getting on with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, there are a number of roads that do need upgrades which were committed to by the previous Liberal-National Party government in Queensland. Unfortunately, with the state Labor government taking over, those projects are now gone. One of those projects is the Hervey Bay-Maryborough Road-Urraween Road intersection. This is a very dangerous crossing. A number of school buses go across the intersection in the morning and the afternoon. It is a crossing that needs to be upgraded. It is on my list of things that we need to get over the line. The second project is the Torbanlea crossing upgrade. This is a road that floods regularly and, of course, cuts off the people in Tugun, which makes it very difficult for them to get in and out whenever there is some weather around. I have some personal experience with the Torbanlea crossing. I managed to hit it at relatively high speed in a vehicle late at night; it is hard to see. Fortunately, we got out of that without too much trouble. The third project is the extension of Kay McDuff Drive in Bundaberg. This will provide opportunities to direct traffic away from one of the largest high schools of the district, with 1,500 students, onto the Bundaberg ring road. Unfortunately, under the new state Labor government, those projects are all gone. However, we will continue to work with the local members and our federal minister to try and get those projects up and running.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I am talking about development in the regions, I would like to congratulate Scott Rowe, the new CEO of RDA. Scott has certainly taken that under his wing and got on with the job. And Bill Trevor, their new chairman, is certainly making inroads into what we needâ€”that is, economic activity for the Hinkler electorate. The biggest issues outside of jobs are electricity pricing and the cost of living. Electricity pricing is absolutely destroying our farm sector. It is making it very difficult for people who have no money with which to pay. We need to ensure that, whatever we do in this place, it does not increase the cost of energy; they simply cannot afford to pay more than they are paying now. We are up some 300 per cent on mandatory disconnections for nonpayment in the state of Queensland. We cannot continue to go down the road we are on. We must address this, and we must do it fast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, back to the budget: the budget does contain, of course, measures that will help deliver jobs, opportunities and economic growth in a way that is responsible, measured and fair, unlike what those opposite would put forward. It is the next step in the coalition's long-term economic plan to build a stronger, safer and more prosperous future for all Australians. But while we know that there are economic challenges, our economic and budget position has improved as a direct result of the coalition's strong financial management. Now, unfortunately the contribution from the member for Jagajaga would have you believe that we all live in a land of fairy floss, that we live in a house made of chocolate and someone will send you a cheque every week if that is what you need. You will simply roll up and someone will give you money, and you can survive. Out in the real world, if you live in the regions you know you have to go to work; you have to create your own wealth and provide your own opportunities. That has always been the case, and I am sure the people of regional Australia will continue to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are helping them on the way, particularly small business. Small companies that have an annual turnover of less than $2 million will have their tax rate lowered from 30 per cent to 28Â½ per cent. As someone who owned a small business previously, I know that anything you can do to lift the bottom line helps you to employ. And I have to say, most of the employers I know at the moment are doing everything they can not to employ people. It is simply too complicated and too difficult, and there is too much red and green tape. But we are acting on that, and we are certainly getting it out of the way as soon as possible. Small businesses can claim an immediate tax deduction for each and every item they purchase, up to $20,000, and I can tell you that in the local region the tills are starting to ring. Small businesses are getting on with it. I would continue to encourage them to buy local: wherever possible, get down to your local supplier and purchase locally, because it is local businesses that employ. There is not a lot of employment on the internet; people are employed locally. So, wherever possible, go down and buy that new pump, buy that new car, buy that new piece of equipmentâ€”whatever it may be that you need for your businessâ€”but try to buy it from local providers, because that way the kids of the future will have employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an annual five per cent discount for businesses that are unincorporated, up to $1,000 a year, and in agriculture we have added $300 million to the drought relief package. For those of us who get out and about in regional Queensland and regional New South Wales, the drought is absolutely devastating. Of course there are a lot of tragic stories to go with it, but we are trying to assist those people as much as possible. All farmers will get an immediate tax deduction for new investment in water facilities and will be able to fully deduct the cost of new fencing from their tax bill. I have heard it said quite a few times in this place that not a lot of new fences appear to get put up for capital reduction; it tends to be maintenance all around, which I can certainly understand. And of course inside families and child care we have $38 billion to support families, including a $4.4 billion families package aimed at giving parents more choice and opportunity to work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say, I was one of those people who was knocking on the Prime Minister's door about this, because the people who come to me tell me that the issue for them is the ability to go back to work. It is as simple as that. It does not matter how much you have in your paid parental leave scheme; at the end of that period of time, if you cannot afford child care you simply cannot return. If your childcare bill is $49,000 annually and you earn only $48,000, then the likelihood of your returning to work is zero. So, I am very pleased that we have made those adjustments and we are getting on with helping people to get back to work if they choose to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have $330 million to help young and disadvantaged Australian job seekers to get their start. In my electorate this is incredibly important. I have a very high youth unemployment rate. We have any number of people who need assistance. I have some 4,000 who are multigenerational welfare dependent. For them, the key issue is to have a driver's licence, because if you live in regional Australia and you do not have a driver's licence then your ability to get a job is decreased significantly. It is very difficult to get employment if you cannot drive a car and you do not have a licence. I am hopeful that some of these packages will help to train some of our youth to get those basic skills, those soft skills. They need to show up on time. They need to be dressed. They need to be ready. And they need to be able to go to work for the whole day and, if necessary, leave their phone in the car. I know that is a challenge for some of our youth. However, those are generally the requirements of most employers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For retirees and pensioners there will be no new taxes on superannuation, because when you look at superannuation the absolute key issue is stability. You need to be able to plan for retirement. You need to know that the government of the day is not going to pull the rug out from under you when you get within a year of retirement or a year after retirement. So, we have committed to no new taxes on superannuation in this term of government, and I am very comfortable with that decision. The age pension will continue to increase. Unlike what has been mentioned by the member for Jagajaga, the age pension will go upâ€”and has gone up in the last couple of weeks, I believe. More than 170,000 pensioners with modest assets will have their pensions increased by an average of more than $30 a fortnight. For those opposite who are thinking about blocking the budget, who just want to vote no, these are the types of things that the people in my electorate need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate the median income is under $500 a week. Most of the people in my electorate are poor: $30 is a substantial change for them, and they need every single bit of it. Those who no longer receive a pension will remain eligible for a Commonwealth concession card, and that certainly helps out. Ever-increasing rates, ever-increasing electricity costsâ€”these things are absolutely spiralling, and we need to get them under control. As a government that is certainly our role, because people expect their elected representatives to do what they need, and what they need is to control the cost of living, to ensure that they can pay their bills every day. They are not that concerned about what will happen in 100 years. They are very concerned about what will happen tomorrow and next week. And a 300 per cent increase in disconnections for failure to pay your electricity bill is unacceptable to me. I commend the budget; I commend the appropriations bills to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:06</span>):  Around this time 13 nights ago, at this time of the evening, a lot of Australian families would have gathered around the television waiting for a plan from the Treasurer for the future of this country. And a lot of them, at the end of the Treasurer's speech, would have been scratching their heads, because this was a backward-looking, divisive and politically motivated budget from a backward-looking, divisive and politically motivated government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is said so often in this place that budgets are about priorities, but I do not think it is completely understood among some of the members in this place just how damaging this budget is for this country and, more importantly, what it says about their view of Australiaâ€”because the kind of budget we have go towards what kind of country we want for the future. There is so much going on around the world that impacts on our nation, and budgets are an opportunity to announce to the country what the priorities for Australia are as we try to make the most of the future and all of the challenges and opportunities that the future brings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The McKinsey Global Institute report called <span style="font-style:italic;">No ordinary disruption</span> said that there are all kinds of forces, in the institute's opinion, that will impact on countries such as oursâ€”the rise of emerging markets, the accelerating pace of technological innovation, an ageing world population and the accelerating flows of trades, capital, people and data. All of that impacts on our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give you one example of what I think is a stunning fact. Around the world in the next 10 years there will be 100 million more unskilled workers than unskilled jobs at the same time as we are expecting to see 40 million more skilled jobs than we have skilled workers. For a country such as ours and communities such as mine and others right around the country, this is our big chance. This is our big chance to set up the next generation of workers, contributors and thinkers to succeed in the economy of the future. If there is one thing above all that will determine the success of the next generation of workers, it will be the ability to benefit from technological change. That means mastering the necessary skills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know, having grown up in the community that I now represent proudly, how crucial it is to give kids the skills and opportunities to get great jobs when they finish school. The sum total of the effort that goes in to our education systemâ€”whether it be in primary school, high school, vocational training or higher edâ€”will determine whether Australia rises or falls in the most dynamic part of a global economy. One of the most chilling things I have read is by an American author called Tyler Cowen. He warns that the world risks being divided into two campsâ€”those who are good at working with machines and those who will be replaced by them. We in this place need to make the choice via our budgets, investments and policies that our kids will be skilled at working with machines and not replaced by them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the initiatives announced by the Leader of the Opposition two Thursday nights ago are so crucial. They are also why I was so pleased to visit Springwood Central State School in my electorate, a school which is already doing, in its code club, some of the coding and computational thinking that the Leader of the Opposition announced in that Thursday night budget reply that he wanted to see in all of our schools. The leader's budget reply ranged across all the STEMâ€”science, technology, engineering and mathsâ€”education investments we want to make for the future of this country. It was all about the jobs that will come for us down the track if we make sure that our young people can fill them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, when the country needed a plan like this, instead we got a political strategy from those opposite. When we as a country were crying out for a plan for the future, we got a grab bag of political fixes, half-baked ideas and last year's cuts. Australia faces significant social and economic challenges that will seriously influence our standard of living in the decades ahead, but, instead of focusing on the issues that concern ordinary Australians the most, this government seems lost and confused, dazed, running around in circles and taking us nowhere. My community have looked at this budget and they wonder whether the Prime Minister is as concerned as they are about the obvious issues facing our nation or is even aware of them at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are not stupid. They know that the real intentions of this government were revealed in the first budget, and they know that if you scratch the surface of the second budget those real intentions are still there. The government's political strategy is designed to mask at the core of this budget some of the really damaging policies that the public rejected in the first failed budget attempt last year. The government was hoping for an extreme makeover; instead they have been caught making it up as they go along.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you do not believe me, check out the interview that the Treasurer did with Laurie Oakes on the night of the budget where, by repeatedly saying, 'Still on the table, still on the table,' the Treasurer confirmed $80 billion in cuts from schools and hospitals. He confirmed big cuts to family payments, which my colleague the member for Jagajaga referred to, and he confirmed the $100,000 degrees and the education policies and education cuts of the first budget are still on the table. He confirmed that on the public record for everyone to see. We also know that the GP tax is, in another version, still on the table, as well as all the other cuts, such as to the ABC, the SBS, community legal services, homelessness and domestic violence programsâ€”the list goes on and on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also clear that the unfairness at the core of the first budget is still on the table. We have heard at length today about the NATSEM independent figures that show that this budget continues the unfairness of the first one. My colleagues have run through some of those stats that show that the government again, unfortunately, are asking the most vulnerable in our community to carry the heaviest burden of their budget and their cuts in particular. That means very real out-of-pocket expensive to wear for some of the most vulnerable and poorest people in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen their real intentions. The mask slipped during question time today. I thought the Prime Minister used the type of language that would make even Mitt Romney blush when he was talking about people on welfare in the usual sneering and snobby way that he goes about that. Something that Mitt Romney would say only in private, caught on a secret camera, the Prime Minister says in the parliament of our nation. I think that speaks volumes about his character. So too does the fact that, at the same time as the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and all those opposite say they care about unemployment, debt, deficit and tax, if you look at their own budget and go through the actual pages you see that on all four of those tests they have failed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me read into the record some of these facts. These are not opinions; these are facts in the pages of the government's own budget. The last time the current Treasurer stood before us to deliver a budget, a year ago, the deficit was $17 billion. It is now $35.1 billion. It has more than doubled in the last year, and it is projected to increase right across the forward estimates. If you look at the gross debt numbersâ€”again, these are in the budget and are not an opinion but factsâ€”you will see that gross debt will now reach $573 billion by 2025-26, up from $499 billion the last time the Treasurer reported it. Again, if you look right across the forward estimates, you can see that debt is increasing. These guys opposite stand up all the time and say they care about debt and deficit at the same time as they are blowing out both. They have been in government for 20 months now; the time has come to take responsibility and to fess up that that was nothing more than political rhetoric in opposition. It has now been tested in government and they have been found wanting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the economic forecast, the member for Flynnâ€”who is a great guy; I have got a lot of time for the member for Flynnâ€”did not seem to be aware, when he was talking about jobs before, that the budget actually forecasts an increase in the unemployment rate. It has been revised up in this budget. Incorporating all of the government's policies, it has been revised up. If you look at the black and white of the budget papers, unemployment will be higher for longer than previously thought. Again, the government has been in government for 20 months now. They need to take responsibility for that record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the same with growth. They banged on about growth and unemployment in opposition. They have now been tested in government. The growth figures have been revised down. What about tax? It is the same thing again. Tax increases both in real terms and as a proportion of the economy are in every single year of the forward estimates. Tax, as a proportion of the economy and in dollar figures, is higher every single year under this government than it was in any single year under the previous government. That is the stunning fact that they should front up to. The government is collecting more tax than ever before. This budget contains 17 new taxes and charges. That is tax. So we have done debt, deficit, tax and employment. On all of the tests that the government has set for itself, it has failed in this budget. Again, that is not opinion, but fact. It is black and white in the government's own budget papers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true, as some of the other speakers on my side have mentioned, that there are aspects of the budget that we will do our best to support. I think it is worth noting when it comes to small business that I am tremendous supporter of small business not just in my community but right around the country. I know the contribution that small business people make to our economy and to our society. I have got the utmost respect for that contribution. I think we should shout from the mountain tops about the successes of our small business sector. I know that both sides the House agree on that point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does speak volumes that a government that has been in power for 20 months is so bereft of its own ideas that the best new aspect of this budget was an idea they restored from Labor. It does need to be on the record that the instant asset write-off, which is a tremendous initiative that I support, is something that was abolished in the last budget by this government. The best thing about this budget is a Labor idea that this government abolished last year and they are now reinstating. They are reinstating it temporarily, which is not ideal; but the principle and the policy of instant asset write-off is a good one. It is one that I was proud to have worked on in another role in this place. We do support that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also indicated that we intend to play a constructive role when it comes to some of the savings measures in the budget. The shadow Treasurer at the National Press Club last Wednesday outlined that we will play a constructive role where we can when it comes to some of the measures proposed by the government. That is becauseâ€”even though we disagree on some fundamental issues, particularly around the cuts to family payments and other paymentsâ€”we do want to play our part in improving the bottom line. We have got our own suggestions around superannuation and multinational tax. But where we can find common ground with the government, we intend to find that common ground. We have indicated where that bipartisanship extends to about five measures that the shadow Treasurer particularly mentioned last Wednesday at the National Press Club.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For evidence that this government is incapable of looking forward into the future, look no further that their cuts to education and their failure to embrace our ideas around STEM education, our ideas around computational thinking in schools and our ideas around higher education and training in particular. For more evidence even than that that the government does not have any ideas of its own about the future of this country, just listen to them in question time. This political strategy they haveâ€”no matter what they are askedâ€”is that they try to answer as if it is something to do with the former Labor government; that is, the last six years of Labor rather than the next decades of the country's future, in particular as it relates to the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have, as I mentioned, offered bipartisanship on small business, crowd funding and multinational tax avoidance. We are interested in finding and shaping the future of this country. It is a future built on a workforce that is geared up, taught and trained to speak the language of the future. Again, I commend the Leader of the Opposition for his foresight in the policies that he announced, which were some of the alternative approaches to the budget that we would take. We did think that the budget was geared towards the next election and not the next wave of prosperity in Australia. It was a strategy to win an election and it was a strategy to win the politics of the day on the six o'clock news, but not a plan to win the future of Australia in the economy of Asia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget, we did getâ€”unfortunately for the countryâ€”a strategy for short-term political survival. We did not get the long-term vision that Australia needs when it comes to job security, affordable education or succeeding in the economy of the future. If we are serious about succeeding, we do need proper investment in our workers of the future. We do need proper investment in our kids, science, technology, engineering, maths, the education that they need and computational thinking, which is the language of future. We do not need this sort of short-sightedness, the cuts or the mean-spirited unfairness which are still at the core of the government's second budget, just like it was at the core of the first.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="YT4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:20</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2015-2016 and related bills, which relate to the budget that was brought down by the honourable Treasurer on budget night. I have got to say that we often in this place talk about the budget following the announcement by the Treasurer of the day, the budget and what it means. What this budget really means is that it is a setting for the future. I think too often we look at 12-month periods. We have got to look beyond the next 12 months when we are looking at a budget. I believe that this budget does exactly that. It looks beyond the next 12 months, it looks into the future and it puts financial structures within the budget settings that are about the future. It looks at how we get the budget trajectory back into balance to deal with the massive debt that we inherited from the other side of the House and the deficit budgets, which are just not sustainable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is a very positive budget. It is a very positive budget for small business. It is a very positive budget in relation to agriculture in my electorate. The announcements made by the Prime Minister in Longreach, four days before the budget was brought down by the Treasurer, certainly were ones that I had worked on for a long time. I know that the agriculture minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, who were both there for the announcement, were involved in that process. The announcement in Longreach was very well received.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would not be doing my job as the federal member for Maranoa if I did not touch on the ongoing impact of the drought in the central-west and the northwest Queensland parts of my electorate. In the last two to three years and particularly leading up to this year with the failure of yet another wet season, we have seen the impact this drought is having not only on the landholders but also on the towns and the communities and the business sectors of those communities. This pastoral zone is going to take a long time to recover from the impact of the drought when the rains do come, because the pastoral sector relies firstly on getting the rain to grow the grass, secondly on being able to restock and thirdly on getting production going with the reproductive side of things, whether they are sheep or whether they are cattle. It always takes time before you start to get the first cash flow emerging, once you are able to restock propertiesâ€”unlike the grain enterprise. Once the rains come, grains can be planted and within six months you can see a cash flow return to those farmers. We received the news only a few weeks ago that we are perhaps on the edge of another El Nino event, which means we are going to go into a drier than average period, rather than the prospect of a La Nina event, which means wetter weather than average. That news was certainly devastating in many ways to those people out there and to me as the federal member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we have a package that is going to do some immediate goodâ€”it was announced in the budget and by the Prime Minister four days before the budgetâ€”the longer we go without rain the more we have to be prepared to make sure that we look after the business community of our towns, the very fabric and fibre of our communities. I will be reporting to the Prime Minister on this as we go through this year. When there is no money out of townâ€”and there is no money out of townâ€”properties are destocked and put into mothballs. It is like mothballing a factory; it is not generating any income. There are no jobs so there is no money circulating in the town. I will certainly be wanting to make sure that the money that has been made available by us through local government is spent wisely, that it employs local people and that where materials are required they are bought locally. That is what we have to do. We have to make sure this happens so that we can start to get some economic activity back into the towns. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One element of the package that was particularly important to me was the Roads to Recovery money being doubled for local government across Australia. Once again it goes into our local councils and they spend it on roads of their choosing. It is a local roads package. It is not designed or administered by state governments or by the federal government. All the federal government has done is double the Roads to Recovery money available to local government. I know that the local governments in the electorate of Maranoa will be getting something like $150 million in the forthcoming 12-month period just for roadsâ€”that is quite separate from the financial assistance grants that they use for measures other than for roads. That was terrific news in the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other element of the budget that I was very interested in was the changes to the Youth Allowance. When it comes to completing year 12, many students from rural Australia who want to go on to post-secondary education have to leave home, whether it is from the town or whether it is from out of town. Whether those students live in the business sector of western Queensland towns or on the land, they have to leave home. If those students are able to get Youth Allowance, it will certainly be of great benefit to them because it will take financial pressure off their parents. The changes will mean that they will not be income or asset tested. I better not quote the numbers as I do not have them accurately in my head, but more students will now be able to access Youth Allowance, providing the bill is passed by the Senate. I put the challenge out to the other side of the House and to the crossbenchers in the Senate to support the changes to the Youth Allowance, because it is going to be of enormous benefit to those students who have to leave home to get access to further education. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomorrow I will be meeting with the executive and members of the Isolated Children's Parents' Association, who come to Canberra every year. They come well equipped, they never ask for anything that is unreasonable, they have done their homework and their submissions are always good. I had the opportunity last Friday to meet with one or two members of the Isolated Children's Parents' Association in my own electorate and they reiterated what I have just said: they think the changes to the Youth Allowance will be of enormous benefit. It is something they have been fighting for and that we on this side of the House have been fighting for for many, many years. We want to get some greater fairness here. We want to get some recognition of the fact that, when you have to leave home from a rural area, when you have to leave your town to gain access to post-secondary education, it is important that we support those families, that we take the financial pressure off parents' capacity to pay and that we give those students an opportunity to go on to post-secondary education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you live in a cityâ€”if you live in this great city of Canberraâ€”you do not have to leave home to gain access to post-secondary education. You can live at home and go to university, you can do further education such as technical training or whatever. You also might have a part-time job and still live at home. That is why the Youth Allowance change is going to be so beneficial and so important to the people I represent. I am certainly looking forward to being with the Isolated Children's Parents' Association people, who I know will be here for question time tomorrow as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about the future of agriculture. We all talk about the great opportunities for agriculture, and there are those opportunities. In my own electorate of Maranoa, when it does rain they will be out there investing again in agriculture. Our agricultural sector produces food and fibre that is not only for our own domestic consumption and wellbeing but that also drives export dollars and earnings for this great country of ours. I was with the Queensland Murray-Darling Committee in Millmerran last Friday, and we announced some $6.96 million for Landcare projectsâ€”initiatives that have been driven by local farmers doing something about the environment in their own area. Whether the projects involve weeds or erosion, they are driven by the farmers themselves. Landcare is in its 26th year in Australiaâ€”it is a great movement that we now recognise as an integral part of most of our communities. It is important that we care for our land so that we pass it on to the next generations better than it is today. There is a Landcare symbolâ€”the two hands and 'Landcare'. It is very well recognised. I said it would be great if we could have that Landcare symbol attached to the work that these people do on their landâ€”in other words, their properties could be certified as being involved in Landcare and dealing with land care issues. Unfortunately the Landcare symbol is only available to those who sponsor Landcare. We need to look at this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consuming countries overseas demand clean and green produce. They want to know a little more about the product they are buying. I was recently at Beef 2015 in Rockhampton. There were over 1,000 delegates from many parts of the world, including international chefs from the Middle East and Indonesia. There were even delegates from Cuba, in the Caribbean, who came to look at our genetics and our food. Whether they are consumers of food or breeders or involved in agriculture in some other way, they all have iPhonesâ€”they all have mobile information technology. This will be increasingly important into the future. It was said at Beef 2015 that 300 million Chinese consumers have an iPhone and buy online. Maybe they want to look at a product on their iPhone, maybe at home or at a coffee shop, and then order online. They want to know more than just whether our food is clean and greenâ€”they want to know whether it is organic and they want to see certification. They want to know about land care or animal welfareâ€”all those things are going to be increasingly important to the way we are able to deliver a message, whether it is through the producers or through Australia as the exporter. We are going to have to deliver more and more information about our products, and our farmers and food producers are going to be called on through consumer demand to provide that information.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I said to the Queensland Murray-Darling Committee and the farmers at Millmerran on Friday that it is important that we move to this next stepâ€”after 26 years of Landcare, they need to sell the message that they are involved in responsible land care. Rather than just accepting what they have done and what we as a Commonwealth have invested in through taxpayer dollars, we need to sell the message with a symbol that certifies that the land care they are involved in is responsible and benefiting the land, increasing its sustainability into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to touch quickly on organic food. We need to make the most of our clean and green and organic status, which is growing year by year as shown by demand from overseasâ€”that was very evident at Beef 2015, as it has been in the work I have witnessed over time. We have various symbols and various accreditations for organics. If you want to export organic food to the United States of America, you have to have USDA organic certification. It is time that we in Australia looked at how we can not only describe our product but also give it a certification that has an Australia wide-standard. There may be different brands that go with it, whether it is King Island or Margaret River in Western Australia or wherever it might be, but we need to have an international 14001 standard. Consumers are going to demand it in future, and it is one of the things that I will be working on in the weeks and months ahead, talking with producers on how we can make the most of our clean, green image and sell more information on these products to our consumers overseas. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:35</span>):  Woolworths is one of Australia's largest employers. Woolworths has a paid parental leave scheme through which full-time and part-time employees can access eight weeks of paid parental leave after they have completed two years of service. The World Health Organization recommends that new mothers should spend a minimum of six months with their new baby to nurture development. That is not only a World Health Organization recommendation; it is common sense that new mothers spend some time with their babies. In our community, the cost of living is increasing. Housing, in particular, is becoming ridiculously expensive. Families need two incomes simply to get by in our community. For a mother who spends six months with her newborn baby, with an employer that only offers eight weeks paid parental leave, the question needs to be asked: how do families get by? How do families get by when an employer provides eight weeks paid parental leave? How do they fund the remaining 18 weeks that the World Health Organization recommends that a mother should spend with a newborn?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the question that the previous Labor government answered when we implemented a government Paid Parental Leave scheme of 18 weeks at the minimum wage to ensure that mothers could top up the 18 weeks with whatever their workplace scheme wasâ€”in this case, Woolworths, eight weeksâ€”to get to the 26 weeks, to get to the six months that is recommended by the World Health Organization, to support families at one of the most vulnerable times in a family's life, when a new baby is born. It was to help mums spend that vital first six months with their babies but still be able to pay the bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, for anyone that is accessing the government scheme and then topping it up with their employer's scheme, these are the people that the Treasurer, Joe Hockey, has described as undertaking basic fraud. These are the people that Scott Morrison, the Minister for Social Services, has said are undertaking 'a rort'. How dare they? How dare two senior ministers in this government tell new mothers on low to middle incomes who are struggling to make ends meet, who are doing the right thing by World Health Organization standards, staying home with their kids for the first six months, accessing a government scheme and topping it up with their employer based schemeâ€”how dare this government tell those peopleâ€”that they are rorters, that they are engaging in fraud?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This scenario perfectly sums up this government's approach to this year's budget: the well-off in our community are protected, but middle- to low-income Australians will struggle to make ends meet and will be worse off because of the changes that are proposed in this year's budget. The government is proposing to stop working mothers accessing both the government Paid Parental Leave scheme and any top-up scheme that their employer may be providing. It will force families to make a wicked choice: the choice of spending more time with their newborn or going back to work to make ends meet before those six months are up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not intending to single out Woolworths. Woolworths actually provides a paid parental leave scheme, and it was one of the first employers within the retail industry to do so. But Woolworths is a large Australian employer. It provides a lot of jobs in our community as well. If people who are working for employers like Woolworths are faced with this choice, they are no doubt going to be worse off. What this will do is that it will force new mums to make that choice. Many of them will choose the government scheme, and workplace schemes will become redundant. They will eventually be phased out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not only my view. That is the view of experts who work in this field every day. Indeed, it is the view of some employer associations in this country. Kate Carnell, the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has said of what the government is proposing with Paid Parental Leave:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's hard to see why employers would continue to pay parental leave if it meant the government stopped paying and they were simply footing the bill for the government â€¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the view of the chief executive of one of Australia's largest employer associations: employers will eventually phase out paid parental leave. That is not in the interests of Australia. That is not fair for families, as the Prime Minister claims this budget will be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An analysis has been done by <span style="font-style:italic;">The West Australian</span> newspaper, which looks at exactly how much working mothers in the retail sector will be worse off. They have found out that checkout operators at Woolworths will be $6,550 worse off and Coles checkout operators $6,376 worse off. IKEA workers will be, remarkably, $11,539 worse off if this government's intention of stopping working mothers topping up the government scheme through paid parental leave is delivered through this budget. That is why this element of the budget must be opposed, and that is why I will fight on behalf of the people of Kingsford Smith to ensure that this element of the budget is not passed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also introduced some new changes to child care. It proposes a new activity test so that anyone who works less than eight hours per week will now no longer be able to access the government subsidy. I say to the government: what about those mothers who are trying to get more than eight hours a week of work who cannot access more than eight hours? Perhaps they may have a disability. Perhaps they may be unable to get work because they are in a region where there is high unemployment. Does that mean that they should be denied the right to access child care? I think not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The income thresholds for the subsidies associated with the childcare rebate have also been changed. The great shame about this change is that it is not additional funding to pay for the changes; it is coming off the back of cuts to family tax benefit B. When a child turns six, family tax benefit B will now cut out. I say to the government: what about the single mum who lives in my community who may be studying, who may be just about to finish a degree, who works two jobs to make ends meet and who has a kid in the later years of primary school or high school? She is struggling to make ends meet and now faces the prospect of losing family tax benefit B. What does that working mother do? Does she stop her studies that she is just about to complete and go and get more work to make up for the difference that she is going to lose?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the wicked choices that this government is foisting upon working families in this country. It is robbing Peter to pay Paul. But Peter is middle-income Australia; Peter is the vulnerable, those on low incomes and middle incomes in Australia. Paul is some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in our society. If these changes are implemented, we will see an increase in poverty in Australia, without a doubt. In a modern context that is not something Australia should be encouraging. Families will be the big losers in this budget. NATSEM modelling that was released today shows that a single-parent family with two children will lose $3,715 this financial year under the government's budget. That will increase to $6,108 in 2018-19. Take-out No. 1 from this budget: Australian families will be worse off. That is what we can guarantee from what is contained in the government's budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In health, this budget continues the dastardly cuts to hospitals funding in the last budget, with $57 billion cut from public hospital funding. The Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick in our community is under stress, with $30 million having recently been cut from its operating budgetâ€”a whole ward closed, nurses not being replaced when they leave, two physiotherapists sacked and the perinatal mental health unit under pressure. This is how some of these cuts manifest themselves in our community. This budget continues the four-year freeze on the Medicare rebate, which will force doctors in our community to charge a co-payment or, perhaps in some cases, to undertake longer consultations. The budget cuts $125 million over four years from the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our community, we are again facing cuts to and closures of health services. I have been informed by the Minister for Human Services that the Medicare office at Eastgardens will close over the coming months. That office will be transferred to the local Centrelink office at Maroubra. Anyone who has been to the Centrelink office at Maroubra would know that the waits there are at least two hours long. The parking is not as convenient as it is at Eastgardens. For elderly people, this will mean a greater impost. Let's face it: most of those who access Medicare office services are the elderly, because they cannot access some of those services online. These people will be worse off because of this government's budget cuts that manifest themselves in the closure of our local Medicare office at Eastgardens. This comes on top of the New South Wales government announcing that the RTA office at Maroubra will also close. What is the lesson from this? Liberals cut services and they hurt our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In education, parents know that the key to a good job, to a stable income and to good living standards for their kids is a good education. That is why Labor invested much more money in the Gonski reforms. That is why Labor invested in trade training centresâ€”to provide kids who may not be academically minded with a pathway to employment through providing trade training while still at school. Champagnat Catholic College in Pagewood recently opened their brand-new trade training facility, having received $1 million from the Gillard government to assist those kids to get the beginning of a trade in the automotive, construction and hospitality industries. Those kids will now finish year 12 having completed the first year of their apprenticeship. What a wonderful opportunity for an education pathway for kids. What has happened to the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program? It has gone. It was completely cut by the Abbott government. There is no support for education for those kids in our community. Also in this budget, we have seen $30 billion cut from the final two years of the Gonski reforms. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">University fee deregulation remains in this budget. It may not have got much media attention, but the government still plans to try to implement deregulation of university fees to force kids to pay $100,000 for degrees. Universities like the University of New South Wales, where many courses are in high demandâ€”engineering, medicine, commerce, law and the likeâ€”will be able to charge whatever they like because the demand is there. Kids from working-class backgrounds in our community will not have access to the education that they need for a good job. This budget also makes changes to pensions, but what remains is the pension age increasing to 70 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the economy, this budget forecasts that unemployment will rise to 6.5 per cent. The reality of this budget is that tax as a proportion of GDP increases from 21.4 per cent to 22.3 per cent. So this fallacy that the Abbott government will be a lower taxing government is a complete farce. It is a lie to the Australian people, because tax increases as a proportion of GDP. Net debt also increases from $250 billion to $285 billion. So not only is this budget bad for the economy; it is definitely bad for working families and for kids in terms of support for education. The one thing we can say about this budget is that Australians will be worse off.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="241589" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McNAMARA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:51</span>):  Over the past 20 months since my election, I have been working on behalf the people of Dobell to deliver a stronger economy, more opportunity and greater investment in our region. Since September 2013 I have delivered approximately $80 million worth of federal projects and programs. Investment in Dobell demonstrates our commitment to families, senior Australians and small business. I am pleased to say that major infrastructure commitments, such as the upgrade of the Ridgeway, Jensens Road and Norah Head boat ramp, are complete. For Central Coast motorists, work on the NorthConnex linking the M1 and M2 is now underway and is scheduled for completion in 2019. This will mean safer and faster travel times for our commuters, allowing them to spend more time at home with their families and loved ones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The planning stages of the Tuggerah Sports Precinctâ€”envisaged to become the Central Coast's largest sports complex and capable of holding regional, state and international tournamentsâ€”have commenced. This project, along with the recently completed Lisarow Sports Precinct, is delivering a real boost to the Central Coast's sports-tourism prospects. As I said in my maiden speech, I want to see the Central Coast develop into the sports-tourism capital of New South Wales. I believe we are well on our way to achieving this goal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our youth are receiving enhanced support through our $3.3 million Youth Skills and Employment Centre, and there is even more support on the way with stage 2 of this developmentâ€”a trade skills centre with a $2 million contract for construction in Dobell's north later this year. The government's Work for the Dole and Green Army programs are providing greater opportunities for local job seekers. These programs are helping young job seekers gain the practical knowledge and experience necessary to secure employment. We are looking after our environment with real practical work underway on Tuggerah Lakes. The foreshore at Canton Beach has been restored, and immediately the local community has seen the benefits through increased the risk. All this has been achieved since the last election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that there is more work to be done. We must continue to strive towards a better future, complete with more opportunity and greater reward. A stronger economy is the key to almost everything we wish for as a community. If we want more stable jobs that provide meaningful work, we need to support stronger small business, provide better childcare arrangements and ensure that all of this is underpinned by a strong national economy. This budget does exactly that. We are repairing Labor's debt and deficit disaster and have set the budget on a path to surplus. Over the next four years the deficit will reduce each and every year from $35.1 billion in 2015-16 to $6.9 billion in 2018-19. Any new spending in this budget meets the government's commitment to redirect funding to investments that boost Australia's productivity and participation. We are committed to returning the budget to surplus as soon as possible. If families and businesses must live within their means, then it is only right and proper that the government does the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are building on our strong foundations with a responsible budget focused on small business, better child care and measures that improve fairness. This budget is about helping Australians have a go. It is about helping mums and dads get back into the workforce after starting a family; it is about support for those who want to start a new small business; it is about security for our senior Australians in retirement who have worked hard in their entire lives to build our great nation. It is about building a stronger economy so that everyone can get ahead; it is about a safe and secure Australia where we can go about our daily lives without fear of attack from those who disagree with our freedoms, ideals and way of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's budget delivers on our commitment to support families by making child care more simple, affordable, accessible and flexible. One of the many highlights in my role as the federal representative is meeting our youngest Australians. From childcare centres to high schools, I support measures to ensure that our children have the opportunity to achieve what they want out of life. For many Australian families, especially those on the Central Coast, the decision to go back to work after having a child is not a choice, but a necessity. Stable jobs and accessible child care is essential in ensuring that families have the tools to provide for their families. This is why supporting early education and opportunities for young Australians to learn is essential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is investing an additional $3.5 billion over five years on childcare assistance, including a new childcare subsidy. The childcare subsidy will provide assistance to meet the cost of childcare for parents who are working, looking for work, training, studying or undertaking any other recognised activity, such as volunteering. Families earning approximately $65,000 or less will receive a subsidy of 85 per cent of their childcare fees with subsidy gradually reducing the 50 per cent for families earning around $170,000 or more. These new arrangements will result in approximately 5000 families in Dobell receiving a subsidy of 85 per cent of their childcare fees. Furthermore, between 9000 and 10,000 local families will receive a subsidy of between 50 and 85 per cent of their childcare fees. Importantly for families earning less than $185,000, there will be no annual cap on the childcare subsidy they can receive. This means that 95 per cent of Dobell's families who access childcare services will receive a childcare subsidy. In addition to these measures, the government is also implementing flexible childcare options. A total of $250 million will be spent on interim home based carer pilot program to extend support to eligible families using home based carers. This will benefit shift workers, including nurses, police, fire fighters and ambulance officers, who are unable to access traditional government supported child care because of the unpredictable nature and hours of their work. This is particularly important for families on the Central Coast who are required to commute out of the region for work. Again, for many locals such travel is a necessity. It is important that we as a government provide a range of flexible childcare options to support families in varying positions of employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of greater support for families, this budget also supports job growth in small business. This will be particularly important in regions such as the Central Coast, where we are highly dependent upon small business to deliver local employment opportunities. Our Jobs and Small Business package will create the right conditions for Australian small businesses to prosper and grow. It will also encourage employers to create new jobs and assist Australia's unemployed to access these new opportunities. The $5.5 billion Jobs and Small Businesses package is the biggest small business package in our nation's history. It will assist Dobell's 8707 businesses invest more, grow more and employ more. We are reducing the tax rate for more than 90 per cent of incorporated businesses with an annual turnover of under $2 million. The company rate for these businesses will be reduced by 1.5 per cent to 28.5 per cent. In addition small businesses with an annual turnover of under $2 million will be able to immediately deduct each and every asset costing less than $20,000 that they purchase between now and the end of June 2017. This will benefit 8283 businesses in Dobell, and this represents 95 per cent of all businesses in Dobell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our support for small business is matched with support for job seekers. The ability to work and earn an income is a foundation of Australian life. This is why we are helping all Australians participate with over $330 million in targeted spending on new job initiatives. This is targeted at employers and young job seekers to support the transition to work. We have also introduced incentives for employers to help mature-age job seekers back into work. Last week I hosted the Hon. Luke Hartsuyker, the Assistant Minister for Employment, in Dobell. The minister's visit demonstrates our commitment to improving job prospects on Central Coast. The minister and I visited the Better Futures Hub to meet with their Work for the Dole team. This is a unique Work for the Dole project, which is teaching young job seekers administration and marketing skills. The minister and I heard how the program has instilled confidence in these young job seekers and provides them with the opportunity to develop marketing projects. It is wonderful to know that two of these job seekers have now secured employment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:00</span>):  Conservatives usually like to remind people of the past. The Abbott Liberal government, however, are desperately hoping for an outbreak of collective amnesia: they want us to forget that they tried to sack their own Prime Minister only three months ago; they want us to forget about the 2014 budget; and certainly, they want us to forget about all of the promises that they made to win the 2013 electionâ€”all of those promises which they went on to dishonour as soon as they took power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to remind the government of one of those promises. Ahead of the 2013 election, in its little blue pamphlet entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Our Plan</span>, the coalition promised that if elected it would:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ restore accountability and improve transparency measures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This, like so many others, is a promise that the Abbott government have broken. Without any review or consultation, the government announced in the 2014 budget that they would abolish the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The OAIC is Australia's transparency watchdog. It oversees the FOI system, handles complaints and provides a cost-free, independent forum for appealing against government FOI decisions. The importance of such an independent body is obvious to anyone who cares about transparency and accountability in government, and the damage that would be done by the government's plan to abolish the OAIC is clear. The government would return oversight of the FOI system to the Attorney-General's own department, a department whose secretary proudly declared in Senate estimates last year that it took a 'hardball' approach to FOI requests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government would make the Administrative Appeals Tribunal the only avenue for appealing against unsatisfactory FOI decisions by government. Instead of the no-cost process offered under the OAIC, anyone who wants to challenge a refusal to release documents under FOI will now have to pay over $800 just to file their appeal in the AAT. Citizens will lose the expert support of the OAICâ€”a watchdog body designed to hold government to accountâ€”and instead have to navigate the full adversarial process of the tribunal themselves. Needless to say, this is a retrograde step from a government with no commitment to transparency or accountabilityâ€”a government, in fact, which we can now see are deeply committed to secrecy, opacity and obfuscation. It is a proposal that Labor cannot and will not support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We established the OAIC in fulfilment of our own election promise to improve transparency and accountability ahead of the 2007 election, and we still believe strongly in the need for an independent FOI watchdog. It seems that the Senate crossbench have come to the same view. Embarrassingly, more than a year after the government announced their plan to abolish the OAIC, and withdrew funding from the body, their legislation remains stalled in the Senate. In an incredible display of arrogance, however, the government have simply acted as if their bill has passed. Despite the clear failure in the parliament, in the recent 2015 budget they provided only a small sum of transitional funding to the OAIC to keep it just barely operational. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The OAIC has been stripped of staff; its statutory office holders are scarcely able to perform the responsibilities which the law still imposes on them. Unbelievably, it was revealed in Senate estimates, the Information Commissioner, Professor McMillan, has to work from home. The position of Freedom of Information Commissioner has sat vacant for almost six months now; the government have simply refused to honour their legal obligation to appoint a new office holder to replace Dr Popple, who left the position at the beginning of the year to take up another appointment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have transferred complaint-handling functions to the ombudsman and policy functions to the Attorney-General's Department, despite the law still conferring those functions on the OAIC. This is lawless behaviour, and we should expect better from the Attorney-General, the first law officer of the Commonwealth. It is not for him to decide whether a statutory body is abolished or not. Under our Constitution, that is a power entrusted only to this parliament. He does not get to choose which laws to honour and which to ignore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a sad irony that the government behaves in this way as they seek to abolish a body designed to uphold accountability in government. It is well past time for the government to admit that their attack on the OAIC has failed. The government should either bring their bill on for debate and a vote in the Senate, or uphold the existing law by fully reinstating the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:05</span>):  It always gives me great pleasure to rise in this House and speak about some of the wonderful achievements of the people of the electorate of Forde. Firstly, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Souths Logan Magpies under 16s players Reihana Marsh of Mount Warren Park and Dray Ngatuere-Wroe of Beenleigh, who have been selected to play in the Queensland under 16 team against New South Wales at the curtain-raiser to State of Origin Game 1 in Sydney on Wednesday night. My best wishes to both the boys in their endeavours, and go you mighty Queenslanders on Wednesday night! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also recently had the opportunity to attend the official opening of the YMCA Trade Skills Centre at Kingston. It is prescient that my good friend the member for Rankin is here, because that is actually in his electorate and he was instrumental in part of that as well. So it is good to see Jim here. I would like to recognise all the students for taking part in the valuable vocational training, which is available thanks to the involvement of generous stakeholders. It was a great morning meeting with young people who are learning a range of skills and gaining the confidence they need to pursue future employment and study opportunities. The centre is making a real difference to the lives of our young people, providing a place for them to learn, grow and feel a sense of belonging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to congratulate young Lachlan Eyers, who won the 2015 Quota Beenleigh World Service Ambassador of the Year award. Lachlan was one of nine local students to present a speech about various global projects being carried out by Quota clubs around the world. The money that Lachlan won will be donated to the Quota club that runs the project that he was speaking about. Well done also to Naomi Smith, who was the runner-up, and Akshaya Ajit, who came third.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, sometimes there are events in our communities which are very sad to comprehend and which affect a wide range of people. This was the case for the Waterford demons rugby league club, who have rallied behind 15-year-old player Andrew Hall, who was unfortunately the victim of a recent hit-and-run accident. The Logan business community and club sponsors mustered support to donate a mobility scooter, wheelchair, bath transfer board, pushbike and other items to make Andrew's life more comfortable while he continues to have operations for his serious leg injuries. This is a testament to the spirit and generosity of the local business and sporting communities. I would like to wish Andrew Hall all the best during his recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I had the pleasure of hosting a number of mobile office visits and community forums around the electorate to catch up with local residents and constituents and hear their views on the federal budget and other local matters. I would like to thank everyone who came along to the community forums at Upper Coomera and Shailer Park to share their thoughts. It was a worthwhile process, and I am very pleased to pass on the positive reactions to this year's budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A warm welcome also to Queensland's newest senator, Joanna Lindgren, who was appointed to the Senate by the Queensland parliament last Thursday, following the retirement of Senator Brett Mason. I very much look forward to working with Joanna, and I wish her all the best in her new role. As Joanna is a local Logan lady, it was great to see another person from our community represented in the other house.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to pass on my condolences to Jaryd Campbell and Belinda Warwick, who farewelled their son Roman Campbell-Warwick on the weekend. Two-year-old Roman sadly passed away in a house fire at Beenleigh on 14 May. One of the things to come of this tragedy was the outpouring of support from the Beenleigh and surrounding Logan communities. At times of tragedy we often see the best in our communities, and the care and compassion shown by so many who have helped this family has been tremendous.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:10</span>):  On Sunday I attended one of the most moving celebrations in my political career: the celebration of Carol and Greig Friday's livesâ€”lives tragically cut short in the Airbus A320 crash in the French Alps in March this year. Carol had just celebrated her 68th birthday and Greig was a month off turning 30. They were going on a holiday together before Greig, a mechanical engineer, began a stint teaching English in France. They were on their way to meet Greig's cousin Pippa in Germany, where she lives, when the plane came down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the service I learnt of the lives of these brilliant peopleâ€”people whom I would have loved to have sat down at a dinner party with. I had met Carol through her love of art through the Amaroo Neighbourhood House. I corresponded with all the family members, because they were passionate members of my community. They had written to me about the environment, same-sex marriage, nursing home closures and many other things in my community. Carol was a registered nurse, midwife, maternal and child health nurse, who most recently worked for the city of Casey. She was a loving mother of Greig and his sister Alex, a devoted wife to husband, David, and sister to three brothers. Her entire family, brothers, nieces, nephews, and her friends, spoke of her joy of life and love of travelâ€”the woman had been everywhere!â€”her love of family, the environment and those less fortunate, her passion for art, for nursing and for study and, above all, her dedication to a life of fun. Carol was a nurse for more than 40 years and had dedicated her life to helping others. She had worked both in Indigenous and in refugee communities. She had worked in the Northern Territory. She demonstrated her social perspective in helping others; not just in her working life, but also when she committed time to working with refugees who came from Kosovo to Australia back in the late nineties. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Carol spent 30 years caring for babies as a maternal child health nurse and 10 years as a midwife at the Royal Women's Hospital. I am sure many have said that thousands of mothers, babies and families are much better off having had the wonderful care from the many years Carol Friday dedicated to this life. An award has been dedicated in honour of Carol Friday's lifeâ€”a scholarship funded by the department of education. It will be awarded annually to a high-performing Victorian nurse to undertake postgraduate studies in maternal and child health. The Victorian Minister for Families and Children, Jenny Mikakos, said the scholarship was a 'fitting way' to acknowledge and remember Carol Friday's contribution. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As Carol Friday always reminded us, the focus of the Victorian maternal and child health service is to provide high-quality, flexible and responsive services to support all families with young children, particularly families in the areas of high growth, rural and remote areas and communities of disadvantage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We then remembered Greig. Greig was described lovingly by friends as a funny, insightful and above all fun-loving individual. All who spoke of him were glowing in their dedications to this marvellous, generous man. They described his love of dance, describing him as someone who danced with the thought that no-one was watching. He was also a dedicated ballroom dancer in the same-sex ballroom competition scene. Greig was remembered for his days at Ashwood Secondary College, where he explored many thingsâ€”and some, I am sure, the school would rather forget aboutâ€”and made great, long-lasting friends. He was remembered for his work as the Queer Officer at the Monash Student Association at the university's Clayton campus, where he also helped found the Gay &amp; Lesbian Engineers at Monashâ€”the GLEAM club. I am sure this was not an easy club to establish! He was also remembered for his voluntary work with the Victorian AIDS Council. He was described by VAC's head as 'instrumental' in the success of its Young &amp; Gay peer education program. At the time, the VAC senior coordinator wrote:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We will miss Greig's witty personality and his sense of humour â€¦ Greig always put others first and this was evident in his ongoing dedication to both 'The Young and Gay' and the peer education program. â€¦ We will remember Greig, and we want him to know that he left a positive mark on the world and put smiles on others' faces as part of his legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">VAC has also dedicated an award in the memory of Greig Friday's life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was one of those services that you walked away from truly knowing the individuals to which it was dedicated. Nobody spoke of the sorrow and the horror of the loss of this pair; they wanted to celebrate the lives of this mother and son. I know they have left an enormous hole in the lives of those they have left behind, particularly David Friday, Carol's husband and Greig's father. Alex, the sister and daughter, was so moved during the ceremony she literally could not bring herself to speak. But it was an absolute testament to these wonderful lives, and I thank everyone for giving us that chance to celebrate them on Sunday.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WYATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:15</span>):  On Saturday, 7 September 2013, I made a pledge to the community of Hasluckâ€”which was published in the local mediaâ€”to engage with my constituents, because I believe that strong families and vibrant communities are an important part of the fabric of our society. A community is a population in a defined area. Within a defined population, people have something in common or share membership of a social organisation. I believe that often we talk about the suburb we live in, but it is really a community; and, if we changed our view of it from an inanimate mass to a vibrant group of people living in a defined area, then I think the wider engagement through events and points of social gathering would enhance the value of that community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up in the country town of Corrigin, where belonging and committing to one another underpinned the way in which people connected. When I moved to Perth, I found that people kept to themselves, and I could relate to a Bill Withers song, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lean</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> o</span><span style="font-style:italic;">n Me</span>, released in 1972. Bill Withers spent his childhood growing up in the town of Slab Fork, Virginia. He moved to Los Angeles and found himself missing the strong community ethic of his home town, and he penned the lyrics to the song <span style="font-style:italic;">Lean on Me</span>, which I related to and still relate to, and I want to cite part of the song:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">We all need somebody to lean on</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an ethos that I am trying to build through my electorateâ€”that we give each other support in the things that we fight for and believe in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In smaller communities, new people are welcomed and become involved in that way of life that it leaves lingering memories for them. I am committed to working together and I believe that we need to work together in my electorate to build stronger local communities. Many of us belong to one or more of the many sporting, social, cultural, church, worker, professional, recreational, volunteer organisations or Returned Services League subbranches. Every suburb has community groups, not-for-profit organisations, church groups, child care, playgroups, and community events that people can attend. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To me, Perth is more than a beach, and I want to place emphasis on the quality of life and accessibility of lifestyle choice for people living in the electorate of Hasluck. We have exciting suburban communities in the east metropolitan region of Perth. Our communities are great places to live. We have great people, great local businesses and some incredible landmarks. But as a community we also face challenges in the future and, with the growing population, our community needs investment. I want to continue to work with all of our community leaders and the people of Hasluck to fight for the resources needed to add value to the way of life they chose when they bought their homes. Earlier today, I spoke of Graeme Harris, who, along with so many others, champion their communities. I believe that stronger local communities are about building the infrastructure, services and social supports that are needed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I doorknock two days every month and, every time I go down a street and knock on doors, I find people who are lonely, people whose lives are without human contact. To me, in this day and age, that is sad. If we are going to build stronger local communities, then we need to involve as many as possible of those who are not fortunate enough to have the company that many of us take for granted. I met a fly-in fly-out woman, who was also a wife, sometime ago and I asked her whether she had family here to support her, and she made the comment that she did not. She came from New Zealand and went through Sydney to Perth, and at night-time she had no contact with anyone. In this day and age, to me, that is sad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many things I want to focus on: child care, youth, family services, aged care and seniors, disability programs, mental health and improved public transport. A more recent, important one was the Powder Room. Colleen Bitmead came and talked to me about a point of connection for women, and she said she needed a building. So I worked with the Kalamunda shire and we now have a building. There are some 25 women that have come together in the Powder Room. They are looking at women's interests and they are supporting each other, and they are encouraging those who have businesses to connect with other women and to share their experiences but, equally, to teach those who are part of the group. They are excited; they will expand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My commitment is to continue to build the capacity of the people who live within the seat of Hasluck and enjoy the quality of life.</span>

                  <a href="248006" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:20</span>):  I am going to tell a love story. One night, my old friend Emma went to dinner at a friend's house and she met Cate, and they hit it off immediately. As time went on, they found that they really liked each other. Not everyone wants the stress and difficulty of a long-distance relationship, but they each flew from Brisbane to Sydney, and vice versa, just to see each other. Eventually, they realised that they needed to be together, so Cate took the big step and moved to Brisbane. Nine years later, they faced a new chapter together; Isobel was born in 2009 and Tom came along in 2011. Tom has been sick for a lot of his life. They have had a lot of scares and they have faced them together as a family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Emma says that their kids see them as married, and that is how Isobel describes her parents: married. But there is something missing. It is the right to make a public declaration of love and permanency, recognised at law. Emma told me tonight that she wants the Vera Wang, she wants the Tiffany and she wants the world to see her marriage as equalâ€”not as something illegitimate or lesser. She wants to know for the kids' sake that, if something happened to her, Cate would be recognised as a widow, no questions asked, no doubt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Emma is one of the millions of Australians who support marriage equality; and, in the wake of the Irish referendum, where 62 per cent voted yes, Australians are rightly looking to this parliament and telling us to get our act together. The Liberal Party pollsters Crosby Textor know that Australians support marriage equality. Their research says nearly three-quarters of Australians support it, an overwhelming majority. And why wouldn't they?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In May, Lee Bransden, who has a terminal illness, travelled to New Zealand to marry Sandra Yates. They had known each other 30 years and had been a couple for eight of them. Why shouldn't they have been able to get married here?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Marriage is not for everyone. Some see it as a patriarchal, oppressive institution that is conservative by nature and they do not support it. But even if you do not believe in marriage as an institution, it is hard to argue that, while marriage is available to the majority, it should be denied to someone on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This form of discrimination, made compulsory by the Marriage Act, should end. Emma and Cate cannot themselves change the law to make this happen in Australia, nor can Lee and Sandra. Neither couple could marry in front of their friends and family in Australia and have that marriage recognised as being equal to others in the eyes of the law and the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we can make it happen. The members of this parliament have the power to change the Marriage Act to remove this inequality. We can do it if the Prime Minister stops requiring Liberal and National members and senators to vote against marriage equality. There is a great movement for change within Labor. In 2008 we changed our platform to support marriage equality. Speeches from Tanya Plibersek, Penny Wong and many others moved me to tears when Labor made this change. Today, more and more Labor parliamentarians are coming out in favour of marriage equality. I congratulate them. I want to thank in particular Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition. Not only is he a strong supporter of marriage equality; he went to the Australian Christian Lobby last year and respectfully told them why they were wrong on this issue. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am a Christian and a supporter of marriage equality under the law. At its heart, marriage equality is a question of legal recognition and legal support for couples committed to each other regardless of their gender. That's why my reasons for voting for change are based upon the broad ideal of equalityâ€”an Australia that includes everyone. However, our current law excludes some individuals. It says to them: 'Your relationships are not equally valued by the state, your love is less equal under the law.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what Bill said to the Australian Christian lobbyâ€”and he gave the marriage equality sign as he left. I thank him for his support for same-sex marriage, I thank every Labor parliamentarian who has stated publicly that they will support marriage equality and I thank every Liberal, National, minor party and Independent member and senator who has expressed their consent to and support for marriage equality. Labor cannot change the law alone. We need the coalition to get on board. The Prime Minister must genuinely and unequivocally make it clear to his colleagues that they may vote as they choose on this issue without fear of recrimination. I have said it before: it is well past time, Prime Minister. It is well past time for couples like Emma and Cate to be able to get married in public. It is well past time for couples like Lee and Sandra to be able to get married here at home and not have to travel to New Zealand, Canada, Britain or anywhere else. Maybe we will soon have the equality that those couples deserve. I hope that the Prime Minister will make that change.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  I rise this morning to speak on the announcement in the budget that the government has addressed a longstanding sore for rural and regional parents of students. By getting rid of the family assets test and the family actual means test from the youth allowance parental income test, the measure will base the assessment for the young person's access to youth allowance on the same criteria as the family tax benefit part A.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Representing a large regional area, this has been a longstanding bone of contention as far as I am concerned. Yes, it is true that people choose where they live, and of course there are penalties for living in certain places. But I have always argued that the children never choose where they live. If they are disadvantaged by the fact that their parents have chosen to live, in this case, hundreds of kilometres not only from a senior secondary school but also from tertiary education, then that is not their fault. In many cases, a familyâ€”particularly farming families, but small business people as wellâ€”can be what we call 'asset rich and income poor'. The issue with that is they may well have substantial assets that mean they are rubbed out of the potential for their children to apply for youth allowance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this is a long ongoing issue. The previous government changed the rules in 2009 and made it far more difficult for many of these potential students to access the independent stream of youth allowance. Since that time, we have seen those numbers accessing that stream fall dramatically. There has been a bit of an increase in the number of rural and regional students attending university, but at the same time we are seeing a larger increase again in those who are attending from metropolitan areas. That effectively means the gap between country and city is becoming greater, not smaller.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is still an outstanding issue for this government and any government that should follow us, as far as I am concerned. We need to be able to make sure that children from rural and regional areas get the same kind of equal access to education as those from the cities. It is much cheaper and easier to stay living at home in your parents' place and just hop on public transport that might drop you off at the university in 20 minutes. There is considerable cost in relocating to the city, possibly 1,000 kilometres or more away, setting up a new home and setting up a new life separated from family. I congratulate the government for making this very good first step. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="8W5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GRAY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:13</span>):  This is a eulogy offered by our friend Mal Washer for Gloria Riley. Mal worked with Gloria for just over 40 years. Gloria first came into' Mal's life when she started work at Green Road Medical Centre. Mal says that she was a high spirted personality and made visiting the centre a pleasure for the patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gloria undertook the evening shifts. One night she tried to convince a demanding patient that Mal was overbooked and running late, and that perhaps the patient should see another doctor. In the end Gloria relented and the indignant patient told Mal of how she had tried to fob her off onto someone else. Mal said, 'I naturally said, "Don't worry about those old boilers out on the front desk, luv."' Of course, the patient happily reported this back to Gloria on the way out. 'I first then felt the sting of an angry and indignant Gloria,' says Mal. 'Gloria's temper could rise as quickly as those high kicks she used to love doing.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gloria joined Mal after he had established Seacrest Medical Centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was a dedicated and detailed practice manager who balanced the handling of sometimes demanding doctors and patients with acrobatic skill. Gloria was relentless in ensuring the best patient care and kept the doctors in good check, most of whom, including, of course, Mal, were more than a little bit scared of her. Dr Geoff Reynolds used to affectionately refer to her as 'the dragon lady'. Gloria moved on with Mal into federal politics as Mal's chief of staff. She loved her life in that role. The staff and politicians of all political persuasions were fond of her, and, members, that is why I have the honour of making this speech today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'We never really left medicine behind,' says Mal, as Mal and Gloria became carers for the many people in the parliament too. Basically, Gloria was good at most things except losing at cards, staying calm when provoked and giving directions. If you needed to get somewhere, Gloria would make sure that you would be really lost. One time she took two hours to get to Parliament House when parked in the Senate car park instead of the House of Representatives car park, and Mal made the mistake of asking her how she took that long to make a journey that would normally take only five minutes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many, being in parliament meant long stretches away from home and family. Gloria gave the parliament a homely feel and Mal reflects how sorely missed she was when she left. We all knew of her fiery personality. This led to many disputes between Mal and Gloria over the yearsâ€”disputes that Gloria always seemed to win. However, she could also be fiercely loyal and dedicated to those that she cared for. She was tenacious in helping people in the electorate. She was determined and fearless in dealing with all levels of government and no case was too hard for her. She never let go until the job was complete. She reminded Mal many times of the badger in the movie <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gods Must Be Crazy</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She worked hard and she also enjoyed a good wine and happy hour with colleagues and friends. The last 12 months of Gloria's life were extremely tough for her. She never gave up, however. She never, ever stopped trying. Although this attitude may have extended her suffering in some ways, she was still bright and alert to the very end. Gloria will be sorely missed by all sides but not forgotten. Mal reflects that beyond the pearly gates things will be sorted out in true Gloria fashion. Let's just hope that none of them ask her for directions. I thank you for your indulgence.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUTCHINSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  Indeed, great news in the state of Tasmania last week and, in particular, in the very important economic driver that is forestry in my state. Last week the University of Tasmania vice-chancellor, Peter Rathjen, announced plans for the university to expand its centre for research into the forest industry, thanks in part to funding from the federal government. The university centre will be funded by $3.6 million from the federal government's Australian Research Council, which will be matched by industry and the university contributions to raise $14 million required for the development of an Industrial Transformation Training Centre. The centre will be a collaboration between the university and seven industry partners in a plan to produce industry ready PhD students and postdoctoral research fellows to drive a transformation of my state's traditionally based forestry sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I share the university's view that there is a huge potential for Tasmania's forestry sector to be transformed from the commodity driven, low-technology industry of the past into something very, very special indeed. The capacity to create value around forestry and wood products and timber has to be one of the keys to unlocking Tasmania's economic revival. The sector of the future will, of course, have to look very different to the industry of the past, and this new centre will help lay the groundwork. Australian Forestry Products Association chief executive Ross Hampton also welcomed the funding announcement for this centre. Like him, I agree that it will be a promising start and a step very much in the right direction for research and development in this important sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rest of the world is focused on the potential of forestry and wood products as the greenest of industries to contribute to a future, environmentally sustainable world. Wood is part of the solution. Wood is, indeed, the fibre of the future. There is already investment in new uses of timber for everything built from building systems to biomaterials to smarter packages, be that laminated timber structuresâ€”and I mention, for example, the Forte building in Docklands in Melbourneâ€”and plastic replacements. Australia and Tasmania, in particular, has a huge potential to be an innovative leader and a major player in the demand globally for fibre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that Tasmania is really good at doing is growing trees, and clever and innovative downstream processing should be an essential component of that capacity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has committed to supporting my home state towards a stronger and brighter future. We said we would do that and this is a practical way in which the Commonwealth government is supporting one of the key industries in my state of Tasmania. There is a significant amount of money; a significant vote of confidence in the timber sector. Wood was the fibre of the 17th century, steel was the fibre of the 18th century, concrete was the fibre of the 20th century and wood willâ€”againâ€”be the fibre of the 21st century. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  The upcoming closure of BP's Bulwer Island refinery will have a devastating impact on my electorate, with the loss of over 350 jobs. It also means that Australia now imports 91 per cent of its petroleum from foreign tankers. This is up from 60 per cent in the year 2000. In fact, Australia now relies on a single megarefinery, in Singapore, for over half of our unleaded petrol supply. Yet the government's recent energy white paper concludes: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Reliability of fuel and crude supply to Australia, which underpins fuel supply domestically, is maintained through diverse international crude and fuel suppliers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This view is delusional. As a nation we are dependent on petroleum for virtually all of our transportation. Petrol, diesel and aviation fuel accounted for over 90 per cent of transport energy use in 2012-13. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the shipping routes through South-East Asia were disrupted, the Australian economy would grind to a halt in a matter of weeks. The NRMA has said that we have as little as three weeks of fuel supply in Australia. We are dangerously reliant upon one refinery for our fuel supplies. In essence, we have adapted a 'she'll be right' approach to fuel security, relying on the historical performance of global oil and fuel markets to provide, in all cases. We are completely at the mercy of foreign supply lines. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is now an issue of national security, not just of energy security. Quite simply, our current approach to fuel security is not good enough, and more needs to be done to address Australia's fuel security. Not only are we losing our refining capability but also we are losing our domestic bulk-transport capability. We are losing jobs and we are risking a potential environmental disaster. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent weeks BP has announced it will offshore the crewing of the bulk carrier <span style="font-style:italic;">British Loyalty</span>. There is not a lot of loyalty from the British towards what is happening here in Australia: closing down the refinery at Bulwer Island, offshoring, and all of the staffing and manning of our coastal fleet. It is now government and industry policy to deregulate coastal shipping, which is opening it up to foreign seafarers. This is a potential safety disaster. <span style="font-style:italic;">British Loyalty</span> will be the third bulk-fuel tanker in the past six months to have its crewing placed offshore. Australia is now completely reliant on foreign shipping and crews, and Australian jobs are going right out the back door. That means, from next month, there will be only two remaining Australian bulk-fuel tankers out of something like 64 bulk-fuel tankers. As a Queenslander this is deeply concerning to me, because it also brings with it a threat to the environment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  During budget week I was very pleased to announce that the Commonwealth will provide $3 million through the National Stronger Regions Fund towards the completion of a new Centre for Regional Knowledge and Innovation in Ringwood, within my electorate of Deakin. This project will enhance Ringwood's already growing reputation as a civic centre and a place to do business and will be completed in conjunction with the Maroondah City Council and the Queensland Investment Corporation. I was also very happy to welcome the Prime Minister to Ringwood, where he formally announced the funding, viewed plans for the project and met a local champion of that project, Mayor Tony Dib, and the broader project team from Maroondah City Council.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The project, named Realm, will be a state-of-the-art facility and will be constructed in Ringwood on the Eastland Shopping Centre site. Key features of the project include: a new library; a comprehensive customer-service centre, combined with regional information services; a designated art gallery, combined with exhibition spaces throughout the centre; flexible learning spaces for use by all local community groups, including schools, universities and other learning organisations; a cafe; and an interactive local-history display. Importantly, though, it will also provide local small businesses and entrepreneurs with support in growing their businesses and creating new local jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This project, which, as I said, will be a partnership between Maroondah City Council, QIC and the Commonwealth government, demonstrates how the private sector and different levels of government can work together constructively to achieve substantial outcomes for local communities such as mine in Deakin. I am thrilled to have secured $3 million of funding to ensure the completion of this project not only for the way it will create a civic centre in the heart of Deakin but also for the productivity enhancements, the support for small business and the local employment opportunities it will create. Together with the redevelopments occurring at the Ringwood railway station, at Aquanation swimming pool and at the Eastland shopping centre, this project ensures that Ringwood will be the place to be in Melbourne's east. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank all those who worked tirelessly in advocating for the benefits of this project including Mayor Tony Dib, Councillor Nora Lamont and council CEO Steve Kozlowski, as well as the whole team responsible for putting this project to me and enabling me to advocate for it with the minister. I am very pleased to have delivered $3 million of funding to ensure that my electorate of Deakin remains a wonderful place to raise a family, to work and to start a small business.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  I want to tell the parliament why I love Paniyiri. Paniyiri is a wonderful Greek festival held every year in Musgrave Park. It was an honour to attend yesterday's official proceedings as the local member and representing the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten. It is Queensland's largest and longest-running cultural festival. This week's festival was the 39th. Over 600,000 people visit Musgrave Park in my electorate for Paniyiri every yearâ€”sorry, 60,000. I wish it were 600,000â€”it would be if it could be. It is a great festival. You cannot talk about Paniyiri without mentioning food. I am told that since it began Paniyiri has served more than four million honey puffs, 320,000 coffees, 20 tonnes of haloumi, 3.75 million souvlaki and 600,000 dolmades. I can vouch for the honey puffsâ€”they are excellent. As the community uses Paniyiri as an opportunity to fund raise for not-for-profits, eating honey puffs is an altruistic act, which is one of the great things about the festival.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paniyiri is a great opportunity to enjoy Greek culture. This year there were more than 20 hours of entertainment on the main stage alone like Greek Dancing with the Stars, the Zorba-thon and the return of the competition for Best Greek Barista. The community always looks outwards. Last year I was quite surprised to see a number of Brazilian dancers next to the Greek dances. The costumes were quite different but it was wonderful to see. This year, being the 100th anniversary of ANZAC, we had more of a serious tone. The community marked the 100th anniversary and Commander Peter Tedman of the Royal Australian Navy was there to take part in the acknowledgement, as was the Queensland detachment of the Royal Australian Navy Band. As always, they were fantastic. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The south side has always had a really strong Greek connection. It is absolutely wonderful for me as their representative to share in that culture. We have had a lot of Greek migrants who have settled on the south side and started businesses. We have some Greek restaurants which rival those in Melbourne and the community leadership has been an integral part of the ongoing success of multiculturalism in Queensland, including through the Ethnic Communities Council of Queensland, a wonderful organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paniyiri is a festival that is really based in the community. The Greek Orthodox community of St George hosts Paniyiri and works with government and private sponsors to get the financial backing they need to make it happen. I went on the weekend just gone. As always, it was an honour to spend time with Father Dimitri and Father Anastasios, two wonderful priests of the Greek Orthodox Church, who always give wonderful and moving services. I also acknowledge the community of St George leaders Michael Anastas, Sam Pavouris, Freda Valassakis and Peter Dinoris. I thank each of them for being so welcoming to me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate festival chairman Chris Kazonis, who is already organising the 40th anniversary, the Greek Club and the thousands of volunteers involved. It was a wonderful festival and I cannot wait for next year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I want to commend the Australians who were in the RAF Bomber Command in World War II for a medal of recognition from Australia. They have only just received some recognition from the United Kingdom and it was fairly shabbily done, I have to say. My father was in Bomber Command and I felt quite embarrassed about the way that was handled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 10,000 Australians served in the RAF Bomber Command in World War II, representing two per cent of those who served. They represented 20 per cent of the losses, with 4,000 lives lost either in combat or in training. The average age of these men was 22; most required two years training, enlisting at the age of 19. They had to be of higher education than most and of extraordinary character and fitness. They were brought from all over the Commonwealthâ€”from Canada, Australia and New Zealandâ€”and were trained in those various countries before they finally ended up in Europe. A Bomber Command crew member had a worse chance of survival than an infantry officer had in the First World War. More people were killed serving in Bomber Command than in the Blitz or in the bombing of Hamburg or Dresden. Of course, the United States's own bomber command was also extraordinarily badly affected by deaths. To give an example, of 100 airmen in the RAF, 55 were killed on an operation or died as a result of wounds, 12 were taken prisoner of war and only 27 out of that 100 survived a tour of 25 operations. I am pleased to say I am standing here because my father was one of those to survive. The British required 30 operations, and, unfortunately, he was only one of two from his crew who survived after their 29th mission.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This weekend, I am launching a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Severed Wings</span>, which describes the murder of his crew as they bailed out over Germany. That led to a war crime tribunal which brought justice to the crew and families. I have to say that a medallion or medal recognising Australian RAF personnel in the Second World War is well overdue. There are only about 100 of these men left. Most of them are over the age of 90 and, quite typically, in very bad health. It would be, in one sense, logistically a very easy thing to do. This Sunday, there will be recognition of Bomber Command at the War Memorial. I have spoken to Dr Brendan Nelson, the director. He very much understands the need for this recognition.</span>

                  </a>  From the 'Hear, hear,' on the other side, I see that this could receive bipartisan support. I commend very much the recognition of our Bomber Command. I quote from Phil Davis, a pilot in my father's crew who was shot down and killed. He talks about a very bad night when '34 of our planes went missing in this raid over Bochum'. I have not the time to read more about that, but let me finally say: 'The trenches were in the clouds and, as in the First World War, the best educated, the men of character, future leaders, were lost.' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  Mr Deputy Speaker, no doubt you, like many Australians, heard last week about the horrible treatment of Australian cattle in Vietnam. It reminded me of other incidents that the Australian parliament has dealt with where Australian cattle or livestock have been mistreated. I am reminded of February 2006, when <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> showed Australian cattle being mistreated in Egypt. The then agriculture minister, Peter McGauran, actually halted the trade to Egypt before the <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> program had even finished. Obviously, Australian governments need to respond, where they can, when Australian cattle are being mistreated. It made many people in my electorate upset, and they took the time to contact my officeâ€”Lianne from Tarragindi, Terry from Eight Mile Plains, Cynthia from Graceville, Fiona from Oxley and Christine from Sherwood, just to name a few. They were horrified at the reports but then further appalled when they saw the response of the Minister for Agriculture, who said, 'This is not our concern.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Australian grazier who turns off cattle would want them to be well treated. Australian cattle and sheep producers are humane and respectful and have good systems. Obviously, in a perfect world we would have all of our livestock slaughtered in Australia under safe, humane systems where we are also creating more jobs by adding value to the meat. Sadly, we are not able to achieve that. I know that, particularly, with some of the cattle being turned off in the north-west of Australia, when you are 5,000 kilometres away from the abattoir at Dinmore it is just not practicable, especially with our transport costs and labour costs. Nevertheless, we should be doing all that we can to make sure that our cattle, our sheep, our goats and our horsesâ€”any livestock that we send overseasâ€”are treated humanely, whether they are for breeding or for slaughter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was proud to work with the then Minister for Agriculture, Joe Ludwig, and many of the others when we developed a much stronger check and balanceâ€”the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance Scheme, or ESCAS. It makes sure that the movement of our livestock is monitored and regulated all the way along the supply chain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a family background in the meat industry going back three generations. I know that the killing of animals is not something that everyone condones, but we must do it humanely, swiftly and, obviously, as quickly as possible. The concerns that have been raised about the mistreatment of the animals in Vietnam makes me realise that maybe we need to provide some of the expertise that we have from those small slaughterhouses in Australia and export that to the other countries. Not every animal slaughterhouse is going to be geared towards the chilling of meat; some will be for domestic consumption. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CBH Group was established in 1933 and is Australia's largest cooperative. It is a leader in the Australian grains industry, with domestic and international operations in storage, handling, transport, marketing and grains processing. Around a quarter of WA's grain is exported through the port of Geraldton.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Geraldton Fishermen's Cooperative was established in 1950 by a small group of fishermen with a vision to market their rock lobster worldwide. Sixty-five years on, it is the largest live rock lobster exporter in the world, a cooperative owned by around 200 fishermen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Out of austerity comes opportunity. When times got tough in the live rock lobster industry, long-time fishermen, Mr Kannakoski senior and his son, Loui, took their boat north to try their luck on the oil and gas fields. Established in 2000 Bhagwan Marine quickly forged a reputation for excellence as a marine service provider for resources and the offshore oil and gas industry. Today, with around 180 vessels and offices around Australia and in London, the Geraldton based national leader also offers an integrated vessel subsea solution for resources and offshore oil and gas.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With a population of around 40,000 people, the output generated by the City of Greater Geraldton economy is estimated at more than $5 billion, with the top four industries in terms of output being mining, manufacturing, construction and real estate. Geraldton and the broader Mid West region host several state-of-the-art scientific and technology projects, such as the Australian Square Kilometre Array project, a technology park and radio astronomy. And I am very proud that they have had a significant NBN rollout, with the majority of the town now fibre to the premises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Innovation is first nature in Geraldton through strong civic leadership, with people like Mayor Ian Carpenter, and through entrepreneurs and community-based organisations, such as the Pollinators. They promote collaboration and pollination of innovation from their CityHive. Geraldton youth are innovative and tenacious, which is why the city is home to so many young achievers. Technology and innovation have been a focus for Geraldton and there will inevitably be more investment in this area, together with tourism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, as the local member, I am very proud to promote the City of Greater Geraldton as a means of illustrating diversity, innovation and economic sustainability, all against the backdrop of a very picturesque city and a fabulous coastline.

                  </a>  What remains is a 2014 Liberal Party budget, the one that cuts $30 million a yearâ€”not just last year but this year and the next yearâ€”out of pensioner concessions. In electorates like mine and in electorates like Hindmarsh it is pretty unpopular, because many people rely on those concessions for their cost of living. For a government that talks about cost of living all the time, they are now savaging those least able to pay. So it is an extraordinary thing for Mr Williams, the member for Hindmarsh, to want to propose this motion and then retreat from it. It is an extraordinary thing that the member for Bass interjects at all. I am stunned that they would pick a fight on this issue. We have all this talk about how fair this year's budget is, but currently what is happening is that the unfairnessâ€”the $60 billion worth of cutsâ€”from last year and this year are slowly rolling out. There have been $1 billion in cuts in health this yearâ€”that is $1 billion extra out of health this year.</span>

                  </a>  That is what is happening. The member for Bass will have his chance. He is speaking on my notion, no doubt in a bipartisan way, a bit further on in the day. But what we have got to establish is: these pensioners do it tough. They are the most susceptible to cost of living arrangementsâ€”most susceptible to those pressures. The last thing any government should be doing is cutting their concessions. And that is what this government is doing. That is what the member for Hindmarsh is doing. That is what the member for Bass is doing. They are hacking into pensioner concessions by hacking into state government budgets. We all know that that is the case. They will try and run. They will try and squirm. But that is the case.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">National Palliative Care Week runs from Sunday 24 May to Saturday 30 May this year, and this year's theme is: 'Dying to talk: talking about dying won't kill you.' It seems to me that, in generalâ€”and it is a modern taboo rather than an old tabooâ€”people are very reluctant to talk about their own mortality and their own deaths, and I think that most of us do not make the right arrangements for what is an inevitable part of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last year I have spoken to a large number of organisations and individuals about palliative careâ€”to many older Australians around the country and many other people on what is a bipartisan sort of issue. I have been to the Saint Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne and the one in Lismore. I have talked to Bill Silvester from Austin Health. I have talked to many families who are part of the Hospice@Home program that is being rolled out by the Hobart District Nursing Service in Tasmania. And, from all of those discussions and from the community forums I have held, I have found that people are actually quite interested in talking about not just the arrangements you might make when you are close to death but what your family and friends and you might do some time before that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems to me that we do have to be better able to talk about it and better able to prepare for it as individuals, families and communities, because it is not something that you want to leave to chance. You do not want to leave your own wishes to chance. You certainly do not want to leave them in a will somewhere up in the attic. There is no point in your advanced care directive or your medical power of attorney being hidden away. You need them to be available at the time you need them, and you need your wishes to be observed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor was in government, one of the things we did do in Tasmania was to provide $60 million and a Better Access to Palliative Care trial, and Minister Plibersek at the time, now our deputy leader, put in place that very good program which I think gives us an indication of the way to go in the longer term as to how to fund palliative care. There was also funding for palliative care services as part of the National Partnership Agreement on Hospital and Health Workforce Reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much of that work, I have to say, needs to be continued with and progressed, because there is a danger that it might fall apart under the current changes to health, and the cuts in particular. As state governments get more and more desperate about their budgets there is the tendency to pare everything back to hospital treatment. But, of course, the more we do in preventative health and the more we do outside of the hospital in terms of preparing palliative care services, both hospice and at-home services, the better the outcomes we get. As the Grattan Institute's very good report shows, having people die in institutions is a very costly affair. It is an intervention in people's lives that is often unnecessary, often in direct contradiction to their own desires. Most people, I think, would express the desire to die in their bed at home surrounded by friends and families. That is the common desire. Occasionally, people do have to be hospitalised or put in hospices. We do have to have those services available, too. But we want to do everything we can to give people the resources to plan effectively to die well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is an area that should be part of a bipartisan focus. I do not think it should be contested. The one thing that ruins partisanship is that we all have to cross this mortal divideâ€”every single one of us. No matter how you vote, what your income is or what your station in life is, death is the great leveller, as Homer said in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Odyssey</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in National Palliative Care Week, we urge people to think about the end of their lives: how they want to be cared for, what values are important to you, what type of medical assistance you want to receive, whether you want to be buried or cremated, where you want to pass awayâ€”whether or not it is in a hospitalâ€”and, most importantly, have you done an advance care directive, a medical power of attorney and do your family know where those are? Make sure they are available. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="137174" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NIKOLIC</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I second the motion. While the member for Wakefield and I can occasionally be on opposite sides of the policy debate, I thank him for raising this matter in the context of National Palliative Care Week, which runs from 24 to 30 May.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">National Palliative Care Week is a regular reminder about the transient nature of life itself. It is a chance to reflect deeply on what is most important in life, human relationships with family and friends at its very core. It is an opportunity to appreciate the reality that human existence traverses a natural and consistent arc, marked by the enduring milestones of birth, life and death. It also reminds us that, in 2015, death need not be feared; and that all of us can help, and be helped by others, in the process of achieving as good and compassionate a death as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tasmania one of the ways we are able to support this aspiration is through the Hospice at Home Program, delivered by The District Nurses, which the member for Wakefield mentioned, which successfully delivered 583 home palliative care packages last year. The growing need for home-based palliative care had been evident for a number of years and I am pleased to say that Tasmanian families now have access to professional support services at a difficult time for loved ones who want to die at home. Many of our people have successfully achieved their goal to remain at home at the end of their lives, which may not have been possible without this program. Many others are now able to achieve their wish of staying at home for as long as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Support workers under the Hospice at Home program provide a range of care services and on-call help. The Hospice at Home program also provides equipment to help patients get home earlier after a hospital stay. More than 80 per cent of our Hospice at Home patients are under specialist palliative care services, and the program has brought together existing providers and access to extra help when clients need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mine is one of those Tasmanian families that have had loved ones pass away in recent years, and each of their experiences has been different. Each individual had different perspectives on how their end-of-life journey would play out. Often, they transitioned responsibility for some, or even all, day-to-day matters to others, and were open to discussing with them in advance the nature and formal authority for their end-of-life care. These are big questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, my family has recently concluded one such discussion with a very close family member who is dying and who has embraced an open discussion with those who love her most. The sorts of things to explore are along the lines of what the member for Wakefield mentioned. Who is best placed to support you at the end of your life? How do you want to be remembered by those closest to you, and how might that remembrance be marked? What legal options do you have to support you to ensure that your intentions and wishes are actually fulfilled?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The medical questions are perhaps the most difficult but also of great significance. What type of medical assistance does someone want now, and do their wishes change if there is a sudden and irrecoverable deterioration in their health? Are they open to an advanced care plan enabling them to specifically detail the treatment they want if they become too ill to reflect their wishes? It is important to note that advanced care planning is not euthanasia but about people taking control and not leaving their future care to others and to chance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the most important thing about having these discussions in the first place is that such openness brings rewards: it supports a dying individual's peace of mind, it clarifies their actual as opposed to assumed intentions with their loved ones, it acts to diminish the burden on every individual as their faculties inevitably diminish and it helps to reduce the stress on other parties as a loved one approaches their end of life. Once commenced, the exact nature of the discussion is, again, unique for everyone, but such a discussion must be approached with the necessary balance of openness and sensitivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all of these reasons, this is an important matter before the House today, and I therefore strongly lend my support to the motion of the member for Wakefield and encourage all Australians to keep the discussion going. That involvement will range from quiet reflection to active discussion to actually distilling and drafting our personal final intentions. In the end, these matters are far too important to be left to chance. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  I thank the member for Wakefield and shadow parliamentary secretary for putting forward this motion on National Palliative Care Week. I am pleased to speak in support of it. National Palliative Care Week is an opportunity for all of us to begin those necessary and sometimes difficult conversations with those whom we love about death, about life and about end-of-life decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the most difficult conversations I had when I was practising for more than 20 years as a lawyer were not in family law cases and not with criminal law charges against clients but in fact concerned wills and estates. It was very difficult to have those conversations with people, so I commend the member for Wakefield for raising this issue. This week provides an opportunity to celebrate life while accepting, recognising and planning for the inevitable.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of know people who have died. All of us have grieved. We fail to discuss the type and extent of medical assistance we wish to receive. We fail to discuss where we wish to pass away. We often fail to do a will, fail to do a power of attorney, fail to formalise our wishes on advanced health directives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the Grattan Institute for its 2014 <span style="font-style:italic;">Dying well </span>report on palliative care. It particularly caught my attention. It stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Most people prefer to die comfortably at home or in a home-like environment with minimal pain and suffering. They hope to be surrounded by friends and family and the care services they need. A good death meets the individual physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs of the dying person â€¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But often the obstacle in front of many people is the conversation they need to have. The hospital is a pressure cooker of an environment, but that is the place where most Australians seem to end up dying. The failure to properly plan for death means many of us die in hospitals or, indeed, in residential aged-care facilities. Fifty-four per cent of deaths of those over 65 years of age occur in a hospital and 32 per cent in a residential aged-care facility. The Grattan Institute reports in <span style="font-style:italic;">Dying well </span>that only about 14 per cent of Australians who would prefer it actually die in their homes. It is about half the rate of comparable OECD countries including the United States, New Zealand, Ireland and France.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor was in government we recognised that Australians needed to take better control of this decision making, so we funded, as the member for Wakefield said, a $54.95 million trial, 'Better Access to Palliative Care', which included $38 million to the hospital service in Hobart. The trial will help us determine what we do in relation to this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to also mention the Ipswich hospice in my electorateâ€”a not-for-profit community owned organisation operating a palliative care facility in Ipswich, in the heart of town. For over 20 years, it has been providing exceptional palliative care and comfort to those terminally ill and their families in Ipswich and the West Moreton region. In 2013-14, there were 2,009 bed days, 86 admissions and 77 deaths at the seven-bed facility. Many hundreds of people were supported through their grief with the wonderful work done through Hilda's House, its neighbouring community centre. The hospice provides bereavement support as well as education to the community and medical professionals on palliative care, death and grieving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 20 years, the hospice has been supported by a wonderful team of wonderful volunteersâ€”183 as of last yearâ€”guided by a dedicated management committee. It has blossomed under the leadership of talented and committed directors. Jan Wilton, a talented and caring registered nurse with whom I had the privilege of serving on the local Health Community Council, served as the director of the hospice for many years. Jan was ably followed by Ros Holloway, a capable and caring person with whom I have enjoyed a friendship as we both attend the same church in Ipswich. In 2014, Ros passed the baton to Sandra Larkin, who will no doubt continue to grow and strengthen the hospice, which is supported by the business community and the meat workers union through regular payroll deductions directly to the hospice. I commend the union for their wonderful work and the hospice for the work they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased to have been a longstanding supporter of the Ipswich hospice. I was bitterly disappointed, I must say, when the new government, through MYEFO, cut the $100,000 to the hospice that I had secured through the Liveable Communities program to enhance community care servicesâ€”one of the first acts of the Abbott government. I commend the new member for Ipswich for securing $3.1 million in Queensland government funding for the hospice for the next three years and look forward to working with the hospice in Ipswich for many years to come. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUTCHINSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  I rise in support of the motion moved by the member for Wakefield. Indeed, as has been mentioned, Palliative Care Week runs from 24 to 30 May. The theme this year is 'Dying to talk; talking about dying won't kill you'. Indeed, dying is a natural part of life. I think we are all very well aware of that. But it is important that we plan and prepare and normalise the conversations that occur around end-of-life. Palliative Care Australia wants to normalise death and dying. To do this, Australians need to feel more comfortable about talking about what their wishes and needs are as they approach end-of-life. Australians need to be comfortable and confident to ask for the care that they want. Indeedâ€”and it has been mentioned by those on both sidesâ€”there is the wonderful work that is going on in a program known as hospice@HOME in my state of Tasmania. This is a program that is coordinated to give better access to palliative care for people particularly in Tasmania in what is a very dispersed population outside of Hobart and Launceston. This system is working particularly well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three partners in this program: the DHHS, the Department of Health and Human Services; the Tasmanian Association of Hospice and Palliative Care; and the district nurses, as I mentioned, who deliver the clinical side of that. DHHS's role is to provide specialist positions in palliative care and strategy around the implementation. The Tasmanian Association of Hospice and Palliative Care, led by Colleen Johnson, is about education and awareness and also the delivery of advanced care planning. I want to particularly compliment the work of Anna Spinaze which I have seen on more than three occasions. She is one of those advocates who works in this space. I first met her at the Brighton-Broadmarsh CWA annual general meeting. She was the guest speaker. She was absolutely outstanding. I met her up at Triabunna at a community discussion around broader social issues in that area. Also, she attended what was a fantastic event, at the Ellendale Community Hall, last Friday: a comedy show about death. It was an engaging way of talking about something that we do not talk about enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The hospice@HOME program, led by Fiona Onslow, is about the clinical and medical support and the care coordination. I want to talk about death literacy. Dying to Know Day is in August. Did you know that only five per cent of Australians will make a plan for the end of their lives? Did you know that 45 per cent of Australians will die without a will? Did you know that only half of us have told our partners about the end-of-life care we want? Did you know that one in three Australians know what a shroud is and how it is used? Did you know that almost half of us want to know more about do-it-yourself funerals? Did you know 60 per cent of Australians choose cremation? Have you ever considered that there are alternatives? Did you know that only half of us get to die in our preferred place?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time left, I want to talk briefly about the hospice@HOME program. Seventy per cent of people, through research, tell us they want to die at home. Indeed, the system that has been developed in Tasmaniaâ€”and which I think has the potential for a model nationallyâ€”is about wrap-around care. It involves all of the service providers to identify gaps in the existing services. It is not a new silo service. It is about packages. In recent times, 44 per cent of the people that have engaged with hospice@HOME have been able to die at homeâ€”and that is their preference. It is about support care, meals, respite, personal care and domestic support; it is about care coordination and keeping people out of hospitalâ€”not accessing ambulances as an emergency. The care provided averages about 64 days at home, avoiding presentations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most valuable thing is the 24-hour phone services. Registered and specialist nurses are available to triage the needs of each client. It is about home and community, where support exists and allows those people to stay in their communities. This is particularly important in an electorate, such as mine, in regional areas. It is a real success program. I encourage all those interested in this space to understand more about the good work that is being done. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation" style="font-weight:bold;">):</span>  I thank the member for Wakefield and those other members who have spoken on this motion this morning. It is a very important topic. It is a challenging topic, but it is very important that we do have a conversation about palliative care and end-of-life care. The theme for this year's national palliative care week is 'Dying to talk: talking about dying won't kill you.' This week is all about trying to normalise death and dying. Palliative Care Australia wants to get the conversation started on many questions. How do you want to be cared for? What values are important to you? That is really important to stress: what are the values important to you at the end of your life? What do you want when you die? Have you considered if you wish to be buried or cremated? Do you want to pass away at home or in a hospice? The previous member said that the majority of Australians want to pass away in their homes. It is wonderful that they do. It is a wish that most Australians would have. Unfortunately, at the end of life, particularly on the pain-management front, people need to be in a hospice environment in order to ensure that their last days, weeks and months are as comfortable and pain-free as possible. Quite often, they do need that care in a hospice environment. Also, have you established a power of attorney?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The aim of National Palliative Care Week is to promote the week, the important messages about palliative care and the value of palliative care to the health system and our community. It is also important to ensure our expectations and those of our loved ones are met in the final stages of our lives. This is particularly the case when it comes to organ donation. Members here would know that I have been a keen advocate of organ and tissue donation for many years. In fact, in my first term, I set up the Parliamentary Friendship Group for Organ and Tissue Donation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having been on the Gift of Life board as a volunteer director, before this life here, I know that people were very confronted by the whole notion of organ and tissue donation. They were confronted by actually having a conversation about what they wanted to do with their organs and tissue in the event of their death. One of the big issues was the fact that people shied away from discussion because of the so-called ick factor. This is also true for National Palliative Care Week. People find it very challenging to discuss the end of their life, what they want done with their organs and tissue, how they want to die and how they want their pain managed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Lyons just mentioned the fact that a significant proportion of Australians do not have a will. Those sorts of issues do need to be discussed. We need to ensure that our last days are comfortable and pain free, that we are surrounded by loved ones and, where possible, that we are in an environment where we choose to be but, most importantly, that we are not worried about what legacy we are going to leave both financially and emotionally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Palliative Care Australia recommends people have an advanced care plan. Having a plan is all about patient choice and that means dignityâ€”choices when it comes to what kind of treatment and medical intervention the patient wants. This is just one of the options, to express your wishes and to make arrangements for after death.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor understands the importance of palliative care. When we were in government we introduced a broad range of programs to improve palliative care, from specialist care to the palliative care approach in residential and aged- care facilities, and also a range of other packages to enhance the palliative care experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of organisations in my electorate doing great work in the palliative care area. I would like to thank and acknowledge the great team and the great work of Palliative Care ACT, Cancer Council ACT, Clare Holland House and the Canberra Region Cancer Centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of National Palliative Care Week this week I urge all Canberrans and in fact all Australians to take a moment to think about death. Take a moment to think about how you want to die and how you want to be cared for to live well, then communicate this to your loved ones. It is most important. Not only is it important that you communicate your intentions regarding your organs and tissue to your loved ones but it is also vitally important that you communicate your intentions for your last days. One of the greatest barriers to getting the care we want at the end of life is not talking about it and we should. Palliative care is not about hiding away or dying away; it is about affirming life and including death as a normal process. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PRENTICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this discussion about National Palliative Care Week and its theme: dying to talk; talking about dying won't kill you. I thank the member for Wakefield for bringing this motion to the attention of the House. Dying is something that many people still find difficult to talk about. Indeed, issues of life and death are still largely taboo subjects, but they do not have to be. Australians actually do want to talk about dying. Research conducted by Palliative Care Australia shows that 65 per cent of women and 56 per cent of men believe that death and dying are not discussed enough, telling me that this number increases to 73 per cent among respondents aged 65 and over. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps these numbers will change as the baby boomer generation tackles end-of-life decisions. Indeed, the baby boomer generations will provide us with many challenges. Elderly residents in care today have come through the Depression, World War II and are generally very appreciative of any support and care they receive. Not so the baby boomer generation, who expect services to suit their needs, not the other way around. They are the ones who should be considering these crucial issues now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we do talk about death and dying, sometimes the results can be surprising. Survey results show that Australians over 65 are six times more likely to prefer dying at home than in a hospital and are three times more likely to prefer home over a hospice. This poses a policy challenge for government because, in practice, most patients still die in hospital beds. Historically, palliative care has been seen as something that takes place in hospitals and hospices. Clearly, this needs to change, but it will require more than just a change in government policy. Culturally, the health system has always been about curing people and keeping people well. This is, of course, understandable and appropriate. It is also understandable that doctors, conditioned to want to cure and make well, are sometimes slower to recognise a patient that needs palliation and not cure. The hospital bed, which is the most appropriate place to treat a seriously-ill person, can be the least appropriate place to provide palliation. What is required is a system that can more quickly recognise patients requiring palliation and a system flexible enough to support patients dying at home, according to their wishes, as long as their condition enables it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Support and advice is available to those who need it. In Queensland, there is PalAssist, a 24 hour, seven-day-a-week free telephone and online service available for palliative care patients, carers, family and friends seeking practical information and emotional support. The service is funded by the Queensland government and provided by Cancer Council Queensland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what this week is really about is having a conversation with those close to you to celebrate life and to talk about death. It is about encouraging people to be comfortable and confident to ask for the care that they want. Sadly, at the end of our lives not all of us will be in a condition to be able to direct the care of our choosing. That is why it is helpful to develop an advanced care plan so that health professionals, family and friends can conduct our care in the manner and location of our choosing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Different states have different resources available. In Queensland we have advanced health directives, sometimes called living wills, that can be established by any adult to give instructions about their future health care. Advanced health directives can outline what treatment of health care a person wants if they are no longer able to make decisions for themselves. They enable people to appoint an attorney for health and personal matters, and they can include information that health professionals should know, including health conditions, allergies and religious, spiritual or cultural beliefs that could affect care. Importantly, in an advanced health directive it is possible to outline the level of incapacitation beyond which you would want life-sustaining intervention withdrawn. This can reduce the decision-making burden on family and caregivers as the end of life nears. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None of this is possible without first starting the conversation about dying. So, in the spirit of National Palliative Care Week, let us not be afraid to all go out there and start a conversation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  According to Volunteering Australia, 6.1 million Australians take part in voluntary work. That accounts for about 36 per cent of the population. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, volunteers are probably the happiest people in the country. They get a great deal of satisfaction from helping others. They enhance the quality of their life and their health. They live longer and they learn new skills. They connect with new people. In terms of the benefits of volunteering, the list goes on: volunteers are happier and healthier, contribute to our community and really feel as if they are making a difference to their nation in so many different ways. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aside from the many positive aspects volunteering can bring to someone's life, the value of volunteering to the Australian economy is just staggering. Volunteering in Australia is worth more than the mining industry. It is estimated to be worth more than $200 billion a year, which is why it is so important that we acknowledge and thank the volunteers who, each and every dayâ€”24/7â€”give to the community in so many different ways, be it at the sausage sizzle for the local school, be it helping out the soccer clubâ€”as friends of mine doâ€”with refereeing, laying out boundaries and keeping score during soccer matches, be it helping out in the men's shed or be it helping out by selling raffle tickets at a sports function. Volunteers help out the community in so many different ways each and every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I come from a background where volunteering is taken very seriously. My mother was very much of the view that we were fortunateâ€”that my sisters and I were very blessed and that we had to give back to the community as much as possible. My school holidays were spent in an old building above an op shop. I would be either serving in the op shop for the autistic centre of Victoria, walking around a table collating newsletters for the community or running off roneo in the old Gestetner machine, and that would be the extent of my school holiday activity. It was serving the community in a range of ways, be it serving behind the counter at the op shop, folding up clothing, doing window displays at the op shop, walking around the table collating the newsletter, stuffing envelopes or printing off the newsletter. That was just one way my mother got us involved. We were also involved in Meals on Wheels and a range of other volunteering activities. My mother believed that we were blessed in life and that we should help out others who were not as fortunate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most people who volunteer do so without ever being publicly recognised, and Canberrans are truly altruistic. ACT volunteers contribute over $1.5 billion to the ACT economy annually. Every retiree I know in the ACT is a volunteer. In fact, they have multiple volunteer roles. They have their grandchildren, and they are helping out with them by picking them up from school or dropping them off to activities, and then they are usually juggling about three or four voluntary roles throughout the week. In fact, they say to me that they are busier as retireesâ€”as volunteersâ€”than they were when they were working.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two weeks ago more than 350 Canberran volunteers gathered to celebrate the 2015 ACT Volunteer of the Year Awards, which recognise the important work that volunteers do in our community. This year a record 83 Canberrans nominated for the awards for community service. I would like to send my congratulations to the 2015 ACT Volunteer of the Year, 22-year-old Sophie Hope. Sophie volunteers with Lifeline and headspace, provides foster care for animals for the RSPCA, and is also on the ACT Refugee Action Committee. I would also like to congratulate long-time volunteer Mary-Anne Kitchen, who was recognised in the category of community health for her work with Palliative Care ACT, where she has volunteered for 15 years. I would like to congratulate the 2015 ACT volunteer team of the year, TADACT Skilled Project Volunteer Team. TADACT stands for Technical Aid to the Disabled ACT, and its team is made up of more than 60 skilled volunteers who donate their time, knowledge and expertise to enable people with disabilities to live independent lives. Thank you for your service to the community, congratulations on the award, and to all Canberrans: continue volunteering.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  I join with the member for Griffith in supporting this motion, and I acknowledge and thank the many volunteers who dedicate their time in my electorate of Dobell. The week from 11 to 17 May was National Volunteer Week. In the lead-up to this week my local community of the Central Coast was reminded of the true value of volunteers when we were savaged by storms. Recently in parliament, I spoke of the impact that this natural disaster had on my community. Without the efforts and dedication of local volunteers, the impact on the community would have been far more severe. While we are reminded of the value of volunteers through testing times, we also encounter their outstanding work every day in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's theme, Give Happy Live Happy, speaks volumes about the roles that volunteers play within our community. Last week I had the pleasure of joining with the Wamberal Surf Lifesaving Club and The Entrance Surf Lifesaving Club, and they definitely 'give happy' and 'live happy' Across our nation over six million Australians give their time to enrich the lives of others, from mums and dads who cook the barbecue at footy on the weekend to the members of the rural fire brigade and state emergency services who help us during our most desperate times of need. Our everyday lives are enhanced by volunteers. Volunteers give up countless hours of their time to improve social, environmental and economic outcomes for our communities. Volunteering is a strong Australian traditionâ€”so strong that it is estimated to be worth more than $200 billion a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, the noblest aspect of a volunteer's work is their dedication and commitment towards a healthier and stronger community. Volunteers do not wake up in the morning and set about their day for personal gain; they do it to genuinely improve another person's quality of life. Each year in my local community, over 16,000 men and women give their time through volunteering. One of the great joys of being a member of parliament is the opportunity to meet and support these volunteers and the organisations to which they belong. Last week, I joined with The Entrance Rotary for their annual Pride of Workmanship Awards. Organisations such as Rotary and Lions give so much to our community. On the night, it was said that organisations such as Rotary need more volunteers. You do not need to become a member of a Rotary or a Lions group to contribute, and they would welcome you to assist them at any time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a world where we are working more, commuting more and striving for that work-life balance, volunteering may not be at the forefront of our minds. When it comes to volunteering, it is true to say that you can give as little or as much time as you wish; it all makes a difference. I am immensely proud of the role volunteers play in our communityâ€”from surf-lifesaving, the iconic image of the Australian summer, to local Men's Sheds, which ensure senior Australians have a place to go, support one another and contribute to their community; from Landcare groups, ensuring that future generations enjoy our beautiful, natural environment, to local sports groups, providing the opportunity for our children to participate in a healthy and active lifestyle. These are the men and women who put so much passion into their work, often for little recognition or reward. Once you start to dig under the surface, you begin to see how much of our community is underpinned by volunteers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my job, a day does not go by where I do not meet with or talk to someone volunteering in our community. I have had the privilege of sharing some of these remarkable stories with this parliament. Organisations such as Share the Love, which grew from two volunteers in a garage into a successful charitable organisation, ensure that young parents are able to provide their children with the best start in life. The Central Coast Cancer Council Relay for Life, which has been supporting individuals and families impacted by cancer for close to two decades, is organised by volunteers. Marine Rescue protect those using our beautiful beaches and lakes, the Rural Fire Service protect us in times of bushfire and the SES assist during times of natural disaster.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Volunteers also complement the financial side of an organisation. For some organisations, there is simply not enough money to undertake all that is needed. Volunteers who work pro bono, out of the goodness of their hearts, free up funds that can be allocated to other areas of the organisation, usually of benefit to the community. Most organisations would not have the financial means to pay for positions such as bookkeeper, social media person or groundsman. Volunteers who take on the many roles available ensure that organisations keep operating, and the community receives the benefits. Five minutes today in parliament simply is not enough time to convey our appreciation for our volunteers and the work they do to underpin our community. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  A fortnight ago, my community in Hotham joined the nation to celebrate National Volunteer Week. This is such an important opportunity for so many reasons, but one of those reasons is that it gives people like me the chance to say thank you for the incredible work that volunteers do right across the country and in my electorate in particular. There are six million volunteers who undertake this critical work that affects all our areas of life, and this is a great opportunity for us to just say, 'Thank you.' It is also a great time for us to talk about some of the benefits of volunteering. The theme for National Volunteer Week this year was 'Give happy, live happy', and I think it is important for us in the chamber today to note that volunteering is great for volunteers too. We know that they are generally happier in their lives, and a big part of that is the fact that they do this important work of helping other Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk a little about some of the volunteers who do really important work in my community of Hotham. In Hotham, we are blessed by a very rich community of volunteers of all ages and all cultural backgrounds, who are doing work in things as varied as health organisations, childcare centres, community houses, animal shelters and environment groups. We have some of the same groups across many of our electorates, with Rotary, Lions clubs and the important work done in hospitals. I am lucky to have a Ronald McDonald House very close to my electorate, and the work that volunteers do supporting that organisation is truly extraordinary. It is important too not to forget our volunteers who are out there protecting the natural environment. A lot of people would not know this about Hotham, but we have a lot of very rich nature reserves and, importantly, a green ridge that is protected by local volunteers. I want to salute the work they do in protecting that local environment for us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many of us in the chamber, the councils in my local area do a great job in recognising volunteers, year in and year out. I will speak about some of the important work that the people in my electorate who have been named Citizen of the Year have done in this last year. Glen Eira City Council gave their Citizen of the Year award to Marjorie Lochhead. Marjorie is an incredible woman, a Bentleigh East resident and founding member of the Moorabbin Hospital Ladies Auxiliary. She is 86 years of ageâ€”I do not think she would mind me sayingâ€”but is still today an active part of the ladies auxiliary and is the current treasurer. She has been working for 39 yearsâ€”longer than I have been aliveâ€”to help raise much needed funds for the hospital and has been weekly volunteering in the canteen and running the monthly trading tables. Thank you, on behalf of the people of Hotham, to Marjorie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge Beverley Douglas, Citizen of the Year, this year, for Greater Dandenong. Beverley Douglas is one of my constituents of Springvale and has been volunteering in her local community for 30 years. Her involvement has been instrumental to the changing needs of her community, including driving new program development and service-delivery models. She has been a long-term volunteer at the Springvale Learning and Activity Centre. Living out in Springvale, I can tell you, over the last 30 years we have seen so much change in that local area. I know Beverley has been right on the money in trying to make sure the services that we provide locally are adapting to that local community. Beverly, thank you so much, on behalf of all the people of Hotham, for the work you do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Saving one of my favourite constituents till last, Charlie Mizzi is one of the most dedicated volunteers in my whole electorate. He was this year named Kingston Citizen of the Year. He has been a tireless volunteer for decades. Charlie is an active member of more community organisations than I have time to go through here, but they include Ronald McDonald House, the Oakleigh and Clarinda Village Committee, the Neighbourhood Watch, the Avicultural Society of Australia and many local senior citizens groups. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have the great privilege of benefiting directly from Charlie's incredible efforts from his years as a long-term volunteer in my office. He and his wife, Gail, are regularly popping in to see and helping us out. They are an incredible part of the work that we do in Hotham. Charlie, on behalf of the people of Hotham, congratulations. We are so proud of the work that you do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Active citizens are so important to us. As members of parliament we are in a unique position in getting to see so much of what goes on in our community. I think I speak for all the members in the House when I say that our work as members of parliament is so enriched by having networks of volunteers across our communities. National Volunteer Week is a wonderful opportunity for us to say, on behalf of the people of Australia, thank you to all of you who are doing this great work.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:28</span>):  I am really pleased to support this motion from the member for Griffith and to support National Volunteer Week. Every week should be National Volunteer Week, because every single day thousands of people in my community give of themselves selflessly and tirelessly to help others in our community. I know they do not ask for much and they certainly do not ask for the limelight, but this motion is a really appropriate way to acknowledge the work of six million volunteers around Australia and the contribution they make, both socially and economically, as we have heard already in this debate, to assist others and to build a better future for our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are the bedrock of our societyâ€”no more so than on the Central Coast, in my own community. According to the 2011 census 19,000 people do some kind of volunteering in my electorate of Robertson. They are people of all ages, from all walks of life. One in five volunteers in my community are aged over 15 years. Seventeen per cent in my community are aged between 15 and 19. They are young people having a go and making a difference. About 11 per cent are aged over 80.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The executive officer of Volunteering Central Coast, Michelle Vanstone, told me that there are around 3,000 groups on the Central Coast, including schools, Rotary and other organisations, that organise voluntary work. Volunteering Central Coast helps volunteers in our communityâ€”around 1,000 a year, they place. They serve in so many ways and it is impossible, in the few short minutes we have, to name them all. But here is a snapshot. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Surf-lifesaving is a very important movement here on the Central Coast. There are 15 clubs on the Central Coast, with eight of them in my electorate of Robertson. There is an army of red and yellow volunteers who make our beaches among the safest in the world, no more so than my own club, the Terrigal Surf Life Saving Club. I was pleased to attend their awards presentation on Saturday night. They have more than 1,100 members and around 350 active patrol members, who served for more than 10,000 hours, in fact, nearly 11,000 hours, with no lives lost over the last season. There were 32 rescues at Terrigal beach. It could have been higher except for nearly 1,500 preventative actions that stopped our swimmers getting into trouble in the first place. Today, I just want to acknowledge and place on record my appreciation to club president, Paul Quick, and to his entire committee, particularly Mardi Love, Beris Meldrum, Chris and Toni Jones, and my own patrol captain Peter Ives. They represent the committee members of so many other surf clubs right across the Central Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In signalling out a few, as I will do here today, I believe they are the examples of many people in our community who serve so tirelessly and so selflesslyâ€”for example, people in the Woy Woy Rotary Club, president Peter Mote and his wife Jane Mote who organised the fantastic opera in the arboretum at Pearl Beach. Over the last 10 years, this event has raised around $200,000 that goes to assist local community groups in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the Copacabana Progress Associationâ€”and I have spent a lot of time with president Peter Hill and his committee membersâ€”who are campaigning and volunteering in their time for better and safer local roads in Copacabana, and for the prompt rollout of fast broadband to Copacabana, which I am pleased to say our government is delivering. There is the Gosford Business Improvement District, led by Deborah Warwick, who are working together to make sure that Gosford is a living, vibrant city. In fact, this Saturday, together with Liberty Family Church led by Kim and Tim Jones, they are organising the national day of thanksgiving right in the heart of Gosford at Kibble Park, calling out our local heroes around the Central Coast. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have six branches of the CWA in my electorate of Robertson, led by group president Elizabeth Sutherland, in places such as Peats Ridge, Somersby, Terrigal, Umina Beach and Woy Woy, and they do a great job. Of course, there is our volunteer SES, led by Gosford controller Rolf Garda and his wife Sue, who did such an extraordinary job through the recent storms. I have made my tribute to them in another place. There are our football and sporting clubs around the Central Coast, led by outstanding people such as Ben Spackman, president of the Sharks, or the Terrigal Wamberal junior rugby league club, who in addition to running the club shaved his head on Saturday to help raise important awareness for brain cancer. And club president Warwick Davis of the Woy Woy Roosters does an outstanding job in our community every single day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also our local churches and the army of volunteers who support the work of outstanding organisations such as Rotary, Coast Shelter in Gosford and Mary Macs in Woy Woy, led by the indefatigable Christine Burge. There are so many volunteer organisations that I could name, but as Ronald Reagan once said, 'No matter how big and powerful government gets and how many services it provides, it can never take the role or the place of volunteers.' So I pay tribute to our volunteers today. They are the fabric of our society. I am proud of the work they do and I thank them all.</span>

You get an appreciation for what makes up this world, so it is with this role in parliament. The things to which we are exposed, should we accept the invitation, truly expand our horizons and open our minds, so it is with the arts. Being a regional MP, it is also gratifying to know that you do not have to travel to Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne to gain an appreciation for the arts in this country. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was challenged by the Minister for Arts, Senator the Hon. George Brandis, to represent my city and region at last year's regional arts conference in Kalgoorlie. Kalgoorlie is a long way from Townsville, but it was a great trip. To know and understand that my city is not alone in pushing the arts from a regional perspective was an eye-opener. There are dynamic people all over this country pushing an inclusive arts agenda from a regional position. To meet and chat with people from organisations such as the Australia Council and other major bodies to discuss my city's presence in the arts landscape was worth the trip.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Brandis was also asked the role of the councils in the arts landscape. He said you first have to understand the nature of local government in each state. My state of Queensland has larger, broader based regional style councils. This contrasts with states like New South Wales and Victoria, which have smaller, more internally focused councils. Neither is right nor wrong but it does show what a minister must consider when looking at arts funding and why there will never be a one-size-fits-all solution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to stand beside my minister, who was able to ensure that the regional arts funding was quarantined in my government's two budgets. In my city of Townsville, the arts enjoy the strong backing of our mayor, Jenny Hill, a dynamic council team headed by Jeff Jimmieson and a local lead councillor, Suzanne Blom.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queensland's Perc Tucker Regional Gallery regularly presents major exhibitions such as the famous Lego exhibition, Brick by Brick. This show saw 102,320 people, many from outside Townsville, come to see it. It is Australia's most visited regional gallery and we are expecting over 120,000 people to attend this year's Strand Ephemeraâ€”a collection of original outdoor artworks which will line our iconic shoreline. Gallery CEO, Shane Fitzgerald, is entrepreneurial in his outlook and continues to push for more space and better, bigger and more brilliant shows with an international look from a regional perspective.</span>

Artistic director, Piers Lane, brings world-class artists to Townsville each year. They conduct tutorials for our children and young musicians. They show that you can love music and it will love you back. They take music from the concert halls to the beaches of Magnetic Island and Palm Island, from Townsville schools to underground mine shafts in Mount Isa. From the cello to the didgeridoo, from the Steinway to the piano accordion, from the violin to the wooden box, the program is inclusive and hugely entertaining.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Opera Queensland brings it productions to Townsville and enlists locals with no musical experience in their shows. They do this all over the state because they have a great product and fantastic audiences, and they want to share. Dance North, Umbrella Studio, North Queensland theatrical groups, the Barrier Reef Symphony Orchestra and the 1RAR band all form part of our varied arts landscape. All are supported by our federal government in one form or another, which understands the importance of participation and the need to take these things from the Opera House and put them in the shire halls.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Townsville is a great city but it is more than just a port, a defence base and a massively important regional home for sporting teams and V8 car races. We are a thriving and expanding arts hub for Northern Australia. We have an important role to play, not just in regional Australia but in the fabric of our entire country and our entire society. This government supports places like Townsville because we know that Australia is more than just Sydney and Melbourne. We are more than just capital cities. We are a government for all of Australia and the arts are an amazing and hugely important part of that. Our CBD is going through a redevelopment and our priority development areas are going in that. We have the Civic Theatre being redeveloped and plans in that space. The arts will have a major part in the redevelopment of our CBD. We know we are not going to get another football team, another V8 car race or another basketball franchise. What we will be able to do is expand our arts centre, and our educational, arts and cultural tourism to appreciate those sorts of people and bring those people to our town. That is what we as a country must do. We must embrace it. I thank the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HWG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:38</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion because it provides me and other speakers from the Labor side the opportunity to reject the claim that this government is a strong supporter of the arts and is a supporter of regional arts in particular; it is not. This is a government that came to office with no policy for the arts, certainly no written policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brandis has claimed that last year's train wreck of a budget was good for the arts. This is another utterly untrue claim by a government that has made untrue claims its hallmark. The arts were slashed by over $100 million in last year's budget. And now Senator Brandis claims that this year's budget has no cuts of any substance for the artsâ€”utterly untrue again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To start with, this year's budgetâ€”this fraud and hoax of a budgetâ€”entrenches the cuts of last year. The Abbott government has suddenly forgotten all about the budget emergency it has been claiming for years and apparently has money to splash aroundâ€”but not for the arts. This year's budget imposes cuts of a further $13 million to the arts through supposed efficiencies to arts and cultural programs run by the Ministry, the Australia Council and Screen Australia. These cuts will cause enormous disruption for hundred of small to medium arts organisations around the country in regional towns and cities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, serious as these new cuts are, compounding last year's, what is of much greater concern is that Senator Brandis has ripped $105 million from the Australia Council and placed it under his personal control. This will cause even more disruption to arts activities across the country. Senator Brandis says he wants to use this money to set up a so-called national program for excellence in the arts within his own ministry. Senator Brandis seems to fancy himself as Australia's arts supremo. He seems to think he can spot excellence in the arts, while the Australia Councilâ€”an independent body of some of Australia's most successful and visionary artistsâ€”cannot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has long been accepted in this country that arts funding decisions should be free of political interference. This is in part because artists will sometimes of critical of government. They should not be forced to produce art that meets with the approval of the government of the day. That is why the Whitlam government established the Australia Council as an independent statutory body with robust peer review and merit assessment procedures to make arts funding decisions at arms length from the government of the day. But Senator Brandis thinks he knows better and decided that he will be responsible for arts funding decisions for over $25 million each year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whatever claims Senator Brandis makes about not being the assessor, the fact is that decisions about who gets funded and who does not will be made within his department. As minister, he will be responsible for those decisions. Senator Brandis has still not explained who will be funded or on what terms or according to what criteria. The potential for political influence on arts funding is obvious. Because we know the vagaries of political favour and of tacit or explicit threats to funding, it will have a chilling effect on criticism of the government. The removal of $105 million from the Australia Council has already had a direct and destructive impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australia Council advised last week that the six-year funding of arts organisations, which has been worked on for many months, will now not proceed, and the Australia Council's June funding round has been cancelled. Senator Brandis's new arts slush fund will require administrative staffing and supportâ€”further reducing the funds available for artists. The Abbott government is duplicating functions already performed by the Australia Council. This is red tape expansion from a government that claims to want to reduce red tape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Far from being a friend of the arts, it has taken Senator Brandis less than two years in his job to slash arts funding and to trash the basic principle that arts in our nation should be free from political interference. Labor will resist this disgraceful, wasteful and divisive move by Senator Brandis to assert political control over the arts. In government, we will revisit all of these decisions made by Senator Brandis and the Abbott government. We will ensure that independence as a basic principle is maintained in arts funding in this country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="198084" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:43</span>):  I rise today to second the motion moved by the member for Herbert. The member is right: as a nation we do have some of the world's best artists, performers and administrators of the arts. This was no more obvious than at the 2014 Regional Arts Summit held in Kalgoorlie-Boulder from 16 to 19 October last year. As the summit was held in my electorate, I was able to attend and welcome Attorney-General and Minister for the Arts, Senator the Hon. George Brandis, to open the event. The Regional Arts Summit is a biennial event with a 16-year history, starting in 1998 with the inaugural national conference in Mount Gambier in South Australia. The nine conferences since have travelled far and wide, from Launceston to Alice Springs. The event showcases the vibrant culture across regional Australia. It is distinguished by the creative leaders who attend and is a trusting environment for networking, collaboration and model sharing between artists, community volunteers, arts and cultural workers, community development managers and cultural leaders. Twice the national event has been held in WAâ€”luckily for me, both times in my electorate. I think it is fair to say that this shows that O'Connor has a very strong arts and cultural environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2000, the second national conference was held in Esperance under the title 'Making Waves'. It was a resounding success and, since then, the biennial event has grown bigger and better. Last year's Regional Arts Australia Summit in Kalgoorlie-Boulder offered delegates a chance to experience the desert life through stimulating contact, networking, artistic programs and inspiring talks. Artistic director Ben Fox curated a creative voyage featuring international keynote speakers, outstanding arts, strategic leadership discussions, peer learning, open spaces and masterclasses. Across the summit's four days, there were over 40 events attended by 574 delegates from across Australian, resulting in over 500 media articles being published. This was not just some small arts event in the middle of Australia; this was one of the nation's foremost cultural conferences being held in a culturally diverse, ever-changing community. The event was attended not only by the federal Minister for the Arts but also by the Western Australian Minister for Culture and the Arts, the Hon. John Day, and by the US Consul-General, Cynthia Griffin. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Regional Arts Australia Summit was also a resounding success in terms of its economic impact. It is estimated that the economic impact from the 2014 summit in Kalgoorlie-Boulder was over $2 million. While in attendance, I personally enjoyed the forum, 'On the Edge of Something Big', with Senator Brandis; Opera Queensland's Lindy Hume; the MONA FOMA curator, Brian Ritchie; and Genevieve Grieves, a lecturer in the Australian Indigenous Studies program at the University of Melbourne. I enjoyed the open and frank debate that was not limited to making art but included discussions on freedom of speech, freedom of artistic expression, censorship of opinions, how art can be part of healing and how art is part of our culture. I was impressed that an arts forum was so diverse. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the event, the Hon. George Brandis announced that a further $187,000 would be invested in regional Western Australian arts projects through the Australian government's Regional Arts Fund. Ten arts and cultural projects will be supported by the fund and delivered in locations across the Kimberley, Pilbara, Gascoyne, Peel, Goldfields-Esperance, Great Southern and South West regions. The Regional Arts Fund is an Australian government program supporting sustainable cultural development in communities across regional and remote Australia. It has an emphasis on youth and on disadvantaged, remote and Indigenous communities. The funding is targeted at activities that will have long-term cultural, economic and social benefits for individuals and communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also announced were five regional artistic development fellowships aimed at helping the fellows develop professional skills and gain experience in the national and international arts landscape. This is a tremendous opportunity for regional artists to work in other regions or citiesâ€”or even overseasâ€”alongside experienced artists. Both funding rounds are now closed and I look forward to the announcement of successful applicants. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently open for application are the Australia Council of the Arts scholarships. The scholarships provide $150,000 over the next three years for high-performing regional arts leaders to participate in the Australian Rural Leadership program. The scholarships will allow high-performing arts administrators or managers working in regional Australia to participate in the Australian Rural Leadership program to develop their management skills and build networks with other regional leaders. I encourage arts leaders in O'Connor to apply. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I have very strong views about making sure our regional and rural residents are not disadvantaged by where they live. Part of that is making sure they have great access to the arts.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government were serious about regional arts, it would not be cutting vital funding to the Australia Council of the Arts. I will take a moment to read an email I received from one of the current recipients of funding from the Australia Council of the Arts. It is from the director of the Castlemaine State Festival and was sent on Friday. It highlights the urgency of this issue and the direct impact these cuts are having on my local community.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the insecurity that this government has made by cutting funding to the Australia Council for the Arts, the independent body where peers decide the arts projects to receive funding. Instead the government has set up its own little group to decide what it believes is best when it comes to the arts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another organisation directly impacted in my electorate because of this decision is Punctum, which is a local independent small to medium professional enterprise of artists. They run their live arts series. I met last week with Jude Anderson, who is the artistic director of this organisation. Her comments and concerns were also quite alarming. Founded in 2004, Punctum is an artist-led live arts organisation based in Castlemaine. It ensures that local artists receive a decent income for their art. Along with its residential program, Punctum creates its own small to large performances in collaboration with local artists and partner organisations in regional Victoria. In 2011 Punctum was funded as a cultural leader in live arts through the Australia Council's cultural leadership initiative, another program at risk. In 2012 Punctum was cited as a Regional Arts Victoria key producer and noted as being one of two regionally based 'icon' arts organisations. Are these not the organisations that we want to be receiving support and funding? Instead, their entire future has now been thrown into jeopardy. Rather than being allocated funding because they have been judged by their peers as being the appropriate body to fund, they now have to hope that Senator George Brandis likes them today so that they receive funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Young and emerging artists will be the most impacted by this politically motivated decision by the Abbott government to slash funding to the Australia Council for the Arts. The Australia Council has announced that it would not proceed with its next round of funding, and I have highlighted two of the local organisations in the Bendigo area of regional Australia that will be at risk. This announcement reveals how hollow is the claim by the minister about his commitment to regional arts, and that is why I find this motion not only frustrating but showing a serious lack of judgement in how serious this government is about regional arts. I call on the government to reverse its decision for the Australia Council for the Arts.</span>

                  <a href="248181" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:53</span>):  Although I am somewhat surprised that the government has put this motion forward today, after the very heavy criticism it has received from the arts community over the last fortnight, I am always happy to champion Australian artists, performers and arts administrators. As mentioned in the terms of the motion, we are home to some of the world's best artists. Labor has no argument with the government on that fact. My own electorate of Newcastle has borne some of Australia's most renowned artists and produces more artists per capita than any other city or region in this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We warmly embrace the arts as part of our daily practice. We are home to one of Australia's oldest and most distinguished literary prizes, the Newcastle Poetry Prize, which this year is celebrating its 34th anniversary. We host the Newcastle Writers Festival, the National Young Writers Festival, the now annual Hit the Bricks street art festival and the This is Not Art festival, or TiNA, contemporary arts festival.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also of note are our urban renewal programs and art spaces that activate public places through creative arts. The Lock-Up, which is located in one of Newcastle's most significant heritage buildings, the former Newcastle police station, is now a multidisciplinary contemporary art space and inner-city hub for creative thinking and doing. Their renowned artist-in-residence program is an important and unique part of The Lock-Up's creative programs. This weekend The Lock-Up in collaboration with local creative agency Headjam won Museum Australia's multimedia and publication design award for their innovative website and received a high commendation for their poster design.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps most noteworthy of our city's contemporary art and cultural programs is Renew Newcastle. It is the brainchild of innovator Marcus Westbury and has been ably carried out since its inception by former general manager Marni Jackson and current general manager Christopher Saunders, with guidance from the remarkable chair Rod Smith. Renew Newcastle has in fact become a national renew movement, with hundreds of renew projects across Australia in major cities and regions alike. The renew model focuses on urban renewal and brokers access to vacant buildings for artisans and inspiring young businesses to make a start and showcase their talents and ideas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Worth noting is a recent project that benefitted from the first round of Renew Newcastle leases. Filmmaker Stuart McBratney has just completed his second feature film <span style="font-style:italic;">Pop-Up</span><span style="font-style:italic;">.</span> Eighty per cent of the cinematography was filmed locally in Newcastle. It will have its debut screening in Newcastle in August. This is one of Renew Newcastle's many success stories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my opening remarks I mentioned my surprise at this motion brought forward by the government today in light of their recently announced cuts to the arts. It is worth recalling that in this year's budget $104.8 million was moved from the independent national peer-reviewed funding body, the Australia Council, and redirected to the newly created National Program for Excellence in the Arts. Grants will now be decided at the discretion of the arts minister of the day. In addition, the government proposes to cut an additional $3.7 million from Screen Australia, almost $4 million from various national galleries and museums, $5.2 million from the Australia Council for Creative Partnerships Australia, and $7.3 million in efficiency dividends from the sector. Make no mistake, the government has made clear where those dividends are to come fromâ€”from the programs that sponsor young emerging artists in Australia and in regional Australia in particular.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An open letter to the Minister for the Arts, signed by almost 9,000 Australian artists, performers and administrators, outlines the damage that this budget will have on our nation and our arts community. It states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This Budget is an enormous blow to the arts community in Australia. It will impoverish Australian culture and society. It will mean loss of livelihood for many arts workers. It will mean many important artworksâ€”works that would inform national debate, expanding the possibilities of this country and its citizensâ€”will simply never be made. â€¦ Artists are workers and taxpayers, and a vital part of the economyâ€”</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">and our regional economies in particular. These cuts to Australia Council funding will directly affect new and emerging artists and small organisations in particular. Perhaps it is worth this government reminding itself of the two principles of responsible arts funding: the arms-length principle and the peer review principle. Most importantly, the arms-length principle, like the Australia Council, allows for better long-term policy development and planning beyond election cycles. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:59</span>):  I rise to speak on the motion moved by the member for Herbert that in part states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ as a nation we have some of the world's best artists, performers and administrators of the arts â€¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously I support that part of the motion 100 per cent. I also recognise, since the member for Herbert is here, the wonderful work that the ABC does in supporting the arts, both in Townsville and around Australia. So I support that part of the member for Herbert's motion. In fact, last week and over the weekend we saw a wonderful display of Australia's emerging artistic talents when we saw over 300 dancers use their talents to protest Arts Minister George Brandis's savage cuts to arts funding bodies and the Australia Council, an independent, at arm's length entity, as other speakers have noted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across Australia, the arts community staged protests and there were flash mobs in Melbourne, saying, 'Why would Senator Brandis cut $110 million from the Australia Council? These cuts are already affecting young and emerging artists, with the Australia Council announcing last week that they will not proceed with the next round of arts funding grants. They have already had to scrap completely or suspend programs that were targeted at small- to medium-sized arts companies, and young artists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brandis has moved most of the funding for the arts to a new body, to be run Soviet style by his own department. Essentially, Senator Brandis will have ultimate control over what art deserves to be funded and what does not. Now, artistic dissent will require ministerial approvalâ€”a sad day that we did not see even in the darkest days of the Soviet Union. Senator Brandis will be making decisions with no published criteria, no peer review system and without any proper justification. The framework is the artistic fear and favour according to 'Bookshelves' Brandis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australia Council is an independent body, with independent experts, who make informed decisions about funding, at arm's length from meddlesome politicians. One of my constituents, John from Annerley, emailed me on Friday to inform me of the impact these cuts will have personally on his son. John's son, and his business partner, started a theatre company nine years ago. It has been very successful. They present theatre work for children aged 2 to 5, promoting friendship and resilience. They have travelled to entertain and inform children throughout Australia, and to Korea and India. This year they have been invited back to Korea and will also be going to Iran. They are not just going to Paris or Vienna, they are actually going to engage with Asia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The making of this artistic program and its international success was only possible because of four separate grants from the Australia Council. Three of those grants were national and international market development grantsâ€”grants connected to Australia's interests in Asia. Due to the cuts by Senator Brandis, the so-called arts minister, these project funds are now not available from the Australia Council.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They say the funds that were awarded through a 'transparent and bipartisan process' are now to be moved to an excellence fund controlled by Senator Brandis, but we do not know his definition of excellence. Maybe literature will have the inside runningâ€”certainly, 'Bookshelves' Brandis literally likes taxpayer dollars supporting his reading interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But back to John from Annerley. He explained, 'Having just spent 10 years working to understand, navigate and access resources from the complex structures that support arts and culture, to be able to access resources to employ the best artists to make the best possible art, it is frustrating to see these structures being dismantled.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the programs that has already been hit by Senator Brandis's wrecking ball is the Creative Young Stars program. This was a program initiated by Labor when in government, a program where all 150 MPs were able to provide grassroots assistance to emerging local artists. This program, that went equally to all 150 MPs, was recently described by Senator Brandis as 'political interference in arts funding'. Political interference in arts funding when it went to every single MP? This is not only bipartisan, it is sesquicentennial-partisanâ€”every MP was involved in it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with a constituent at a street stall out in front of the Moorooka Woolworths on the weekend who had benefited from that program. He is a rap artist who is about to launch his third album and he was so grateful for the help from that program because it gave him the start he needed. That constituent's music may not be what the arts minister describes as excellent, but it is what Australia needs. I condemn senator Brandis for taking control of arts funding. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs SUDMALIS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  I use this opportunity to show an example of a great federal arts fund grant in Gilmore. On May 8, I looked in my diary and saw that I was to attend a microgallery opening in Junction Street, Nowra. As a painter myself, my curiosity was immediately engagedâ€”what on earth is a microgallery?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This gallery is designed to show art in small and creative ways and was one of 80 regional art and cultural projects that received support through round 2 of the Australian government's Regional Arts Fund. The fund is set up to support sustainable cultural development in regional and remote Australia. The program provides funding for a mix of quick resource grants and community grants for art projects, professional development of artists and art workers and community capacity building projects. The microgallery initiative certainly did all of that in Nowra. The aim of the vent was to blur the line between fine arts and street art, changing the way we see our world. The streets and laneways of Nowra's CBD came to life with the work of 20 local artists and they were joined by 15 international artists, including a US based photographer, a Finnish street provocateur and a Paris cartoonist. Micro Galleries is an international art project with the goal of bringing art in many forms to the community to demonstrate that art is for everyone, breaking out of the set spaces and becoming part of the community directly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the themes were on the environment, like the collection of junk mail that was converted to a constant ribbon of waste paper to be used as bean bag fill, or a curious installation aimed to change someone's day for the better. There were temporary boards, live performances, video presentations and some permanent installations. The yellow painted piano just near my office is eye-catching and completely spontaneous. It encouraged some to play a tune or two. Nowra is the first Australian city to host Micro Galleries. Other recent appearances were in Cape Town and Hong Kong. The local artistic director, Kat Roma Greer, who grew up in the Illawarra, has spent a lot of time in Shoalhaven, including a recent stay as an artist in residence in Bundanon. Kat explained how Nowra was selected as the first Australian location. She says that during her residency at Bundanon she spent time in Nowra and was blown away not only by the amazing art community that worked across the Shoalhaven, but also the beautiful buildings, cool little laneways and the cafes and shops in and around the CBD, as well as the initiative at Nowra Alive kicking off. She just felt that Nowra was the perfect fit for Australia's first microgalleryâ€”a seemingly unassuming town with lots to offer. One of the other facilitators for the project was Bonnie Greene<span style="font-weight:bold;">. </span>She was the artistic producer, apart from being a practicing artist herself, she also has a close connection to Bundanon through her arts administration work. It is amazing how the Bundanon Trust workshops and residencies act as a catalyst in foretelling the vision and legacy of Arthur Boyd.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Zina Churchill makes a trifecta of art advocacy for this event. She believes her art form is the process of removing the jargon and fluff around marketing. Clearly her 20-plus years in this industry was a great part of this artistic endeavour. The Regional Arts Fund was a source of much needed dollars to pursue this concept. I suspect that Zina may be an exhibitor by herself later, as she is a photographer. A vacant shop was used as a pop-up exhibition space for a live performance or two, a seminar venue and how art can be part of anyone's life. It was explained to me that Micro Galleries aim to change the way the community views the significance and possibilities presented by street art, and also to show those who are interested in street art, that they can perhaps express themselves in more interesting ways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly the project brought together diverse groups in our community: generational, cultural and socioeconomic. It all seems to bring together different segments of the community such as business, residents, council and creating industries, all working together for free public art. This initiative demonstrates how affective art can be in bringing life, creativity and enthusiasm to a business center that has elements of despair, empty shops and concerns about retail trading. Microgalleries do this by driving business to the local community, particularly the cafes and restaurants, and the local boutiques shops, as participants wander through the CBD viewing the works. Another aim was to showcase the air deco buildings of Nowra to generate future interests and a possible return visit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Creating this precinct activation and regeneration reframes the perceptions of street art and how it can impact on a community. It also helps to establish small business partnerships, possibly we can have another microgallery in 2016. You have to admit, it is pretty curious when you see people standing by the curb side, all looking up at the sky. You ask why. Because the artist wrote a sign on the footpath in three separate words. "Loo Kup Now". So people can experience the ever changing skyscape. The funding for this project was exceptionally well spent, congratulations to all the participants, both artists and those looking at their work.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  by leaveâ€”I would just like to speak again about the need for a regional focus on the arts. As I said, when we went to Kalgoorlie it was just fantastic. Patricia O'Callaghan from Townsville Enterprises and I went across to Kalgoorlie to represent Townsville. It was fantastic to see every region in Australia participating in this conference and the ability for each local region to be able to be in that space and be passionate about their arts scene.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to speak with a partisan voice when I come to this, because I do love my city and I love what we do in this space. There is Perc Tucker Regional Gallery and the way they present a bank building as a fantastic art gallery. We need to be able to redevelop that. We have Umbrella Studio, which does a fantastic job in print making and Aboriginal art, developing those talents and working in conjunction with James Cook University in that space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a great society. If you look at the larger regional centres in Australia they are a microcosm of Australia. Sure, there will be gaps in the system, but there are people in there who are willing to make it work. There are schools in my city which have fantastic music programs, such as Belgian Gardens State School, which works into Pimlico State High School and Kirwan State High School. These are schools of excellence when it comes to their music programs. They make sure that music and art are an intrinsic part of the school curriculum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It can be understood that if you are good at any of the arts then you can prosper in no matter what field or skill there is. The number of doctors, dentists and highly professional people who play a musical instrument have been able to put themselves in that space. They have a basic understanding of maths and then understand that music is so fantastic for mathematics. You have to be able to count and you have to be able to keep time. That is what music does; you have to be able to work outside your own brain to work and to be creative in that space. It is something that we should foster in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My wife is an early childhood teacher. While she understands the need for the national curriculum, she does believe that it is becoming overcrowded. She does not believe that kids today should have to be able to work through geography and those sorts of things. It is a personal philosophy of hers. Other educators who I know say, 'You can still do the basics of English and mathematics; no matter which subject you are speaking of it is important that we do support the arts.' It is important that we do have an artistic perspective for our country, and especially for our regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is incredibly important for regional Australia that we are able to protect that space. I thank the House.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) calls on the government to restore the funding, and prevent the loss of frontline services.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, we saw in the Abbott government's first budget, 2014-15, cuts of some $549 million to Aboriginal funding for programs around the country. They were, in my view, consistent with other cuts we saw in that budget whereby the Abbott government targeted some of Australia's most disadvantaged people and low-income families when it came to trying to balance its budget. It was, indeed, referred to as a very unfair and unjust budget. And rightly so; we saw a backlash against it right across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was particularly concerning was that some of those cuts did indeed disadvantage further some of the people in this country who are already at a terrible disadvantage. We saw from the debate then and the report of the committee that is steering closing the gap policies around the country that we are still far short of closing the gaps on a number of targets that we have set ourselves, whether it is to do with life span, education outcomes for early childhood and later on, work and employment opportunities for Indigenous people and housing and other measures that we quite often use. To then have $549 million cut from a program where we are already not meeting the targets that we set ourselves is in my view one of the most heartless cuts I have ever seen by a government in the time that I have followed politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was particularly heartless because amongst the cuts will be cuts to front-line services such as power and water to remote Indigenous communities. I know that is going to affect communities in my home state of South Australia, but I also understand it will affect even more the communities in Western Australia, where some 270-odd Indigenous communities will be directly affected and where at one stage the Premier of Western Australia had indicated that some 150 of those communities may well close down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is all right for the Prime Minister to say that he understands the plight of Indigenous people in this country because he spends a week in a remote community or to say that the government cannot continue to fund lifestyle choices of Australian people, but the reality isâ€”and it appears from these cutsâ€”that what the government is really saying is that it does not care or simply does not understand the impact that these cuts will have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So concerned were the Indigenous people about the cuts to remote communities that they indeed took the matter to the United Nations, and only last month it was debated there. My understanding is that the Australian government was, embarrassingly, condemned by an international body for its treatment of Indigenous people here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that in my home state there has been a temporary arrangement and some funding has been provided, but the truth of the matter is that even that only came to being because the Indigenous elders met a couple of months ago in desperation and forced the government to come to the party and do the right thing. It is no good for the government to simply say that these are state or territory matters and that it can offload its responsibility onto the states and territories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My concern is this: for those remote people, in many cases that is the place they were born. It is the place they understand, and their connection with their land is paramount in their lives. Just as importantly, when they are pushed off their land, where do they go? To the fringes and outskirts of larger communities where sometimes they are unwelcome. Even if they are welcome, the truth is they find it hard to integrate and settle down. It is much more difficult to provide them the services when they are in camps on the outskirts of the communities than if they had remained in their own communities. Inevitably, it leads to other kinds of social problems, including at times petty crime and the like, which in turn means we clog up our court systems, our jails and our police operations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is short-sightedness on the part of the Abbott government that in the end will cost more money than what it saves and badly affects Indigenous people across this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Nationals Chief Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  I thank the member for Makin for bringing this motion to the House. I think the electorate of Parkes possibly has, after the Northern Territory, more Aboriginal people living in it than any other. Indeed, for a rural electorate, I represent more Aboriginal people than I do farmers. It is a job that I take very seriously and with a great amount of pride. I think the greatest discrimination and injustice we have shown to our Aboriginal brothers and sisters is that of lower expectation, and what we have seen with changes to the budget and the Abbott government's philosophy of managing our Indigenous communities is an area of responsibility. Over the years, we have seen programs that have been put in place, set and forgotten. While that might benefit some of the people who manage to get a job in management, more often than not the trickle-down effect to the people that need that help the most does not get there. It is with great shame and regret that even today an Aboriginal child born in the Parkes electorate has a much lower life expectancy than a child of another background.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has been implementing policies that have outcomes attached to them. We are supporting Indigenous businesses and work programs in the western part of my electorate which are putting many people into work. A couple of weeks ago I was in the Pilbara in Western Australia where, at one of the mines, over 300 Aboriginal men and women are earning good money. Many of those people are the first in their family, through many generations, to have meaningful employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the indigenous schools program we are encouraging children to attend school because it is known that, without an education, inequality is very difficult to eliminate. I have now been in this place for eight years. Over that time I have seen former ministers come to my electorate, speaking in slow, measured voices so that the local people can understand. For too long we have measured our commitment to things that we are trying to do in dollars and cents, without real commitment. This government and my philosophy in particular is to take ownership, to work with the people to give them what they desperately need.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last 12 months we have seen funding come to my electorate for the Aboriginal health organisations which are at the cutting edge in places like Bourke, Condobolin, Coonamble, Walgett and Wellington, particularly with the drug and alcohol strategy. The funding that has gone into Moree for the refurbishment of Roy Thorne House enables rehabilitation facilities to be put in the community where they are needed. The program I would like to highlight today is the Clontarf Foundation. The coalition government, state governments and the corporate world is funding Clontarf, where young boys right throughout Australia are encouraged to stay at school. I would particularly like to mention a couple of young lads from Coonamble who are working with Leightons Construction in Sydney and are very proud to do so. The former school captain of Brewarrina is doing a fine arts degree at the University of Newcastle this year because of the work of the Clontarf Foundation. This is not an academic debate from me; this is something I take very personally. The people I represent are relying on me to deliver programs that will make a real difference to their lives, not just measuring this in dollars and cents.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  At the outset, could I recognise two constituents, Paul Myers and Sister Kerry McDermott, who have lobbied me about remote Aboriginal settlements. Each year, Sister McDermott runs a memorial for the Appin massacre close to my electorate. This morning she held a service in Minto, which my wife attended on my behalf. They have both lobbied me against the proposal in regard to remote settlements. And in contrast to the comments by Nigel Scullion, the minister, that this is an historic agreement, Western Australian Premier Barnett said that in contrast it will cause great distress. Furthermore, Reverend Sealin Garlett, chair of the Uniting Church indigenous committee, said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This of course relates to the question of federal funding. In the 2013 book <span style="font-style:italic;">Spoken Here</span>, by Mark Ableyâ€”I recommend it to youâ€”which dealt with the disappearance of languages around the world, the author started an international survey with the example of Patrick Nudjulu, a speaker of Mati Ke. It is one of the 200 languages still spoken in this country, and only 20 of those are not on the endangered list. Yet, the government, in a budget where there is billions of dollars, decided last year to take out $9.5 million in regard to the preservation of Indigenous languages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the previous speaker talk about waste. We all know that there is waste throughout the private and public sector in this country. But one has to question priorities that would see 200 languages further threatened. I did not hear any reason as to why it was inept or incompetent and a waste of money. We see a situation in this country where on the health front babies born to Indigenous women are twice as likely to die in their first term than those born to non-Indigenous women. We have a situation where 39 per cent of Indigenous Australians aged over 55 have diabetes. And, as we all knowâ€”it has been quoted for decades but there has been a slight improvementâ€”Aborigines have a lower life expectancy, lower that the age to which this government wants people to work until they can get the pension. Yet they can scrap hundreds of millions of dollars in the $543 million reduction last year in the health budget for Aboriginal people, including measures in regard to smoking. Despite the prevalence amongst Indigenous Australians of cardiovascular problems, I did not hear an account saying that in this massive budget, with very extensive increases in Defence expenditure, we cannot find the money to keep these services going, without there being any examples as to why they were so inefficient.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the question of criminality and over-representation in jails, and, for that matter, over-representation in deaths in custodyâ€”</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON:</span>
                  </a>  I haveâ€”the Institute of Criminology. Anyway, you are going to speak next. Ten to 17 year-old Aboriginals are 24 times more likely to be incarcerated. They are three per cent of the Australian population and yet 13 per cent of homicide deaths and 11 per cent of homicide offenders are Aboriginal. They are the latest criminal statistics. Despite the prevalence of involvement in homicide, despite the over-representation in incarceration, despite deaths in custody, and despite objections otherwise, we have a situation where amongst the decisions made in the last budget was the one to strenuously cut legal aid. These people do need representation. We do not want a system like in the United States, where people are jailed simply because they have inept or no legal representation. You cannot tell me that a significant number of people in that situation do not go there for that reason.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have a situation where, after these federal reductions, the Barnett government at the moment is cutting $30 million to $60 million from health services. Because of those decisions last year, and the agreement to turn this issue back to the states, we have a situation where these remote settlements are now threatened. Perhaps it is a lifestyle that many of us would not want to live in a million years. Perhaps there are some people who could benefit from it. We have a situation here where land is important to these people. If the previous speaker feels quite emotional about it, I can also testify to it. My wife is Indigenous and I feel a great involvement in these affairs locally. I have a very strong commitment. It is not good enough to say that there is waste and an ineffective trickle-down effect here. The situation is that if these schemes are so dreadful and so unjustified, I would have liked to have heard individual defences last year as to why these particular measures had to be reduced. There might be other measures that I have not quoted from the budget that there might be more reason for.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROUGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:28</span>):  Before the member for Makin leaves, I want to preface my comments by stating that I do not doubt for a moment the genuine nature of his intent and nor that of the member who has just spoken. I do very much, though, want to draw his attention first of all to the comment he made about deaths in custody. It is really important that we do not continue to permeate and repeat misconceptions. The fact is that the royal commission on deaths in custody established very early on in the piece that there were no extra numbers or an additional percentage of Indigenous deaths in custody when compared with non-Indigenous. What should have been in the report is how we stop all deaths in custody. I will just leave that there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As far as these other issues are concerned, I want to deal specifically with the provision of services in remote communities. I dealt with this as a minister. We looked at the time as to why the Commonwealth was involved in the provision of water, sewerage, electricity and rubbish collection. We are not in any other municipality, yet we are there. No-one could find, historically, through the department how the Commonwealth became involved. It is important we understand. The best we could come up with is that you had Commonwealth members of parliament across the political spectrum over a period of time lamenting the fact that state and territory governments had not done enough to look after and provide provision of services which is their responsibility through local governments. So, bit by bit, the Commonwealth became involved. Back when I was the minister, we started this processâ€”I am not sure whether my predecessors had or notâ€”but I know for a fact that the member for Jagajaga, who succeeded me as the minister, continued to try to find an answer to ensure that both Commonwealth and state were not involved in an area which is and should be simple to administer. That is why there have been arrangements made with South Australia, Queensland and WA, which is underway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I make it very clear that no-one is suggesting that communities be closed down by the Commonwealth; quite the contrary. But unfortunately the member for Makin again repeated a statement we hear all the time: this is people's land; this is their homeland. This is a very emotive term: homeland. It brings to the mind that this is where me and my family and my ancestors were all brought up, but if you go to places in the Tanami Desert you will find that these communities were established in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Why? Because they were trying to remove the trouble, the problem, out of the bigger towns such as Kununurra and push them further afield. It was not because of care, love or affection; it was to get them out of sight and out of mind. We should not run away from the cold, hard reality that that is where those communities came from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member opposite talks about the deplorable level of health in the Indigenous communitiesâ€”putting more money back into places which do not have an economic basis, where no-one can have a job, where you say to a child, 'Go to school, get an education and maybe even go on to university, but don't ever aspire to work in this community. Don't ever aspire to have a business in this community. You won't get an apprenticeship in this community, because the land tenure doesn't allow it.' So we actually set people up for failure. I repeat this message time and time again, because, until we are honest enough as politicians who sit on both sides of this chamber to have that conversation with people and say, 'Education does not leave you to being able to be self-sufficient in your own community you choose to live in,' we are living a lie and we are denying them the rights that every other Australian has.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most disturbing comment I have heard in this debate today was from the person who has instigated this, the member for Makin. I know he does not mean ill by these comments, but he says that the concerns are that these peopleâ€”Aboriginal Australiansâ€”will move from those communities to be fringe dwellers or long-grass dwellers, that they will clog up the jails and they will clog up the court system. That aspiration, that concern which looks like an aspiration, is where we go so horribly wrong. I aspire these people to do as Noel Pearson says: be able to live and hang onto their languageâ€”it is their right and their responsibility to do so, as so many other communities in Australia doâ€”but also to have the rights and responsibilities to fend for themselves, to protect their families and to be safe. You do not do that by shutting down a community or by funding a community that is dysfunctional and having people living in the long grass around Tennant Creek, Alice Springs or any other place. When we do that, you, the members of the Labor Party and we the members of the Liberal Party, fail. So what we should do is look at this in a far more serious faction, community by community, seek out the answers with themâ€”they are thereâ€”and take them on the journey with us. Debates about money miss the point. This is about people: people's past and people's future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  I participate in this debate as someone from a metropolitan area, but also as someone who is proud to represent one of the largest Aboriginal populations in an urban environment in the country, in Chifley, which sits in Darug land but has become home to people of all different nations within the lands of the Darug. Whenever these types of discussions come before parliament, I will instantly want to be involved because of the fact that I represent so many but also the fact that I feel strongly about the types of issues that I believe prevent people in my area from reaching their full potential. I note here the presence of the member for Hasluck, who, along with other members, visited the area of Chifley earlier this year as the chair of the committee investigating the recognition of our first peoples in the nation's Constitution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to deal with some of the things the previous speaker, the member for Fisher, touched upon, because, as much as this has an impact on, or is a focus on, remote communities, what happens is that people from other lands move into an urban setting. The issues, I feel, are bound by a common thread across a number of areas, be they education, which in some cases, if it is not strong enough, prevents people being able to exercise their economic opportunities and progress in their own way, being able to draw off a basis of skills. There are other issues as well, such as the support services that are required to help people maintain their potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The types of things we are concerned about are often in terms of when the Abbott government cut the IASâ€”the Indigenous Advancement Strategy. Suggestions were being put forward that this was being done for improvements or to cut out waste and inefficienciesâ€”nearly half a billion in funding has been cut. If we are serious on a whole range of areas in dealing with the type of things that have prompted some of the comments that have been extended in this debate you cannot do it by sheer will alone. You need to have the resources to back it up, which is why I feel strongly when, for example, people rightly say, 'unfair, debacle, lack of consultation' as being the themes that have come out in the way that the Indigenous Advancement Strategy has been managed, and the way that the funding has been cut. You cannot do a serious job on this strategy if you are cutting the funding in the way it is being done. Critical front-line services have been held in limbo since the last budgetâ€”not this budget the last budget. There are organisations that are trying to negotiate new funding contracts more than a year since the actual strategy itself was implemented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Withdrawing federal funding for municipal and essential services in remote communities is not only concerning for those areas. But, from my perspective, I worry about the downstream impact, particularly when 500 of the 964 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations that received funding see the way the program is being managed. A new mandatory incorporation requirement will see 56 of the successful organisations receiving more than $500,000 being required to incorporate rather than to opt to incorporate. There has been a lack of consultation and engagement with communities about the strategy as a whole.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my area I have seen, for example, some of the biggest organisations that would have benefitted from this fundingâ€”for instance, the Butucarbin Aboriginal Corporation. It has been around for nearly 25 years, managing nearly 13,000 cases. Through a combination of IAS and funding cuts they are at risk of losing their continuation of funding. They have only been guaranteed funding for the next year, into 2016, and they have recently faced substantial cuts and threats to their services from the state government as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Organisations like Learning Ground, in Bidwill, also have a high proportion of young people from Aboriginal backgrounds and face their funding being cut. We have those funding cuts plus the Gonski arrangements, which would have directed higher levels of funding to my area, taking into account young Aboriginal people going into the schools there. When you see all the cuts that are happening, how do you skill people up, how do you prepare them for work, how do you prepare them for proper engagement in communities?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where I do have economic growth that is happening within the electorate itself, and where we are working to get people involved, you cannot do these things just by wishing them to occur. They need to have support, they need to have the funding and they need to have a commitment that backs that up to ensure that people can do the best in areas like mine and in areas that are the subject of this resolution.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WYATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  I thank the member for Makin for his motion. In discussions I have had with Premier Barnett; Minister Collier, the Western Australian Aboriginal affairs minister; Minister Helen Morton, the Western Australian Minister for Mental Health; and Terry Redman, the minister for regional Western Australia, all four have given me a strong commitment that there will be no closure of Aboriginal communities. There will be no closure without consultation. What they have raised with me is the concerns that I have seen over my lifetime: access to services, facilities and career pathways for children. Even when I was involved in many of the early reports that were tabled in either state or Commonwealth parliaments, the message consistently was: 'We will choose to live in certain areas, but we also accept that there are areas where governments cannot provide funding. It is our choice.' That choice is important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what I have found since the Hawke government is that there has been a decline in the practice of consulting on the ground and talking about what is needed. In fact, when I was in Health I worked with Shane Houston to develop a measure in Health that looked at community functioning. It was designed to be a tool that would enable Commonwealth and state agencies to go into a community and look at the programs and services that were being provided. This came off the back of my thinking in respect of an earlier inquiry by the Commonwealth Grants Commission on Indigenous expenditure and a couple of very salient points they made. They saidâ€”they made this point quite stronglyâ€”that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander funding was supplementary to mainstream government services. They went on to say that government agencies at both the state and federal levels relied on Aboriginal budgets to provide services to communities and to organisations, instead of saying, 'They are citizens of Australia; they are entitled to have access to funding.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have always found in agencies that, when you are planning, they say, 'What's in the Aboriginal bucket?' When I was in Health, I asked the then secretary of the department what was the representation of the Aboriginal dollars in Aboriginal health against the total health budget. I asked for a pie chart to be shown to us. That slice of the pie chart, when you considered the total Commonwealth budget for health, was as thin as a strand of somebody's hair. It was insufficient. Yet people should be accessing the range of government services. We should not talk about mainstream services; they are government services to all citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that my four parliamentary colleagues in Western Australia are considering that issue in the context of the planning that they have in mind for the engagement with Aboriginal leaders within each of those communities, and they have given a genuine undertaking. Terry Redman, when he met with me in my office, talked about an orbit community around a central hub and how they could provide and look at job opportunities in the future. He was certainly looking at agriculture, particularly in the Pilbara and in the Kimberley, given the northern Australian strategy as a way of proceeding. But it was also the intent of CDEP and many other training programs to train people in particular skills that would give them pathways into jobs that any other Australian could walk into. Instead, what we saw was that those programs became enmeshed in, as Noel Pearson says, sitting down for the dole. The training that was supposed to come did not happen. Had it happened, communities would then have been better positioned to take care of their infrastructure. There would have been jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The intent of programs and services has significant merit, but I find it fascinating when I walk into an organisation and I am being told that they meet their KPIs yet, when I get permission to walk through a community, I do not see the change that is supposed to have happened. I think all successive governments, including future ones, need to look at outcomes on the ground so that education, employment and health become the priorities and we give people choices as to where they live. But if they choose to live in a family context on country then there must also be the reciprocal understanding that they then access a hub within the orbit arrangement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is hope and opportunity, but I think that all members of this parliament have to set aside their positions and work collectively to achieve the changes that we need to make a difference for the next decade, because if we do not then nothing will be achieved.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  It was my pleasure on Saturday to open the Victorian branch of the Australian Relief Organisation. This is a philanthropic organisation which was established in New South Wales in 2012. It is a not-for-profit, non-governmental organisation involved in development, relief and advocacy projects and activities in Australia and overseas. ARO's mission statement specifically declares that their activities are aimed at helping people in need without regard to race, gender, age, religion or social status. This is a mission statement that I can strongly support, and I was very pleased to open their Victorian chapter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Examples of their activities include visits to hospitals, to aged care centres and to correctional facilities, to provide community support to those marginalised and in dire situations in the community. In Sydney, ARO has established a social inclusion visits program that calls on volunteers to visit the elderly at a number of aged-care facilities, and ARO also assists migrants and refugees through skills training; helps orphans and families in financial hardship; and collects clothes, shoes, bags and homewares to send to communities affected by natural disasters including the most recentâ€”the Sri Lankan floods and the Nepal earthquake. I would like to congratulate Ali Goru, the state manager of the Victorian branch, for the wonderful work that I anticipate that he and his board of directors will do in aiding the community both here and abroad.</span>

In 2010, Prue joined Yarra Ranges Relay for Life as a volunteer committee member, after participating in the event for many years. As she told the local paper earlier this year, her interest started after her cousin died from cancer at the age of 19, and so she went along to the Relay for Life committee and asked how she could become involved. After two years as a committee member, she became the chair at the age of 19, managing a committee of 10 people of all ages. Last year she managed the event at a new location, and she has overseen 70 teams and 900 participants from across the Yarra Ranges and raised nearly $130,000 for the Cancer Council for research. She was recognised on Australia Day by the Yarra Ranges council and was named Young Citizen of the Year. As I said, I wanted to recognise the great work that she has done and the inspiration she is to other young people in the Casey electorate who are volunteering.</span>

The community pitch allows local not-for-profits to pitch interesting projects to community members and potential sponsors, who all vote on their favourite idea. The West Welcome Wagon was founded in September 2013 by a local resident, Mia McGregor, who was moved to action after visiting a newly arrived asylum seeker home and finding that they were without electricity, bedding or cooking equipment. Mia launched the group on Facebook after sharing her experience and receiving enormous community support. I have followed their progress closely and have been moved to personally support their cause recently. The West Welcome Wagon currently provides goods such as bedding, food and clothing to over 500 families in Melbourne's west. Most of the people who are assisted by the West Welcome Wagon are on bridging visas. Many have not had working rights and are only eligible for a portion of the Newstart allowance. In the first year alone, West Welcome Wagon provided over 500 beds, 460 food hampers and 100 bicycles, all donated by local residents and groups. They also provide children's toys, kitchen appliances and in-home English language support. The $2,000 first prize will go towards draught-proofing properties. Electricity prices are expensive and draughts can account for up to 40 per cent of heat lost in homes. Draught-proofing is a cheap and effective way of keeping people warm as we head into winter. So congratulations to the West Welcome Wagon and to the entire community of the west, who have come together in this generous project.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  Last Friday I joined with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Central Coast Express Advocate</span> to host the Central Coast's first ice summit. Over 300 people packed the Mingara Recreation Club to hear from our expert panel, ask questions and provide personal stories about the devastating effects this insidious drug is having on our community. In a confronting discussion, we explored the ice epidemic, from the supply of the drug, to the experience of addicts and their families, to the response from local police and healthcare officials, and also the tales of rehabilitation. The stories and information shared at the summit will form the basis of a submission to the National Ice Taskforce on behalf of the Central Coast community. We have a wealth of expertise and experience on the Central Coast and, by developing a coordinated community-government approach to combat the ice epidemic, we can begin to break the stranglehold it has on our community. I will continue to work closely with my parliamentary colleagues here in Canberra and also the state member for Terrigal, Adam Crouch, to ensure that we have an action plan that our community can embrace to tackle ice usage.</span>

We have commenced our discussion, but now we have to build on these foundations and deliver real outcomes to combat the insidious use of ice and methamphetamine, especially on the Central Coast.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  Last week I visited the Byron Youth Service to speak firsthand with them about the great work that they do with our community but also about the difficulties they are facing due to the many funding cuts they have had. For 26 years the Byron Youth Service have run programs, courses, events and activities which have really assisted the young people in the region. They have had a very meagre budget, but they have had very dedicated staff. They provide mentorship, guidance, skills and support to young people. But they have had funding cuts from both the state and federal Liberal-National governments, and these cuts now threaten their actual ability to provide these outstanding services to the community. In fact, the cuts are so severe that they are indeed threatened with closure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among the cuts that really affect them the most are cuts to programs such as Youth Connections. Of course, we saw in the last federal budget that Youth Connections was cut. Youth Connections is a really important program which has had a truly impressive success rate. It provides a lot of support to those young people who are at risk of disengaging or who have disengaged from school. It helps with the provision of a whole host of different activities in case management, referral, liaison and family support. There is nothing to replace this program that the Abbott government has cut. So for services like the Byron Youth Service it means they cannot provide vitally important services such as Youth Connections. It will have a very severe impact on this service, because it might close the Byron Youth Service. So I am imploring the government to fund services like Youth Connections and keep the Byron Youth Service open.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  It was a busy time in my electorate of Brisbane last week, with three ministerial visits. First of all, we had the Minister for Social Services, the Hon. Scott Morrison, who visited Lyndhurst Early Learning Centre. He was shown around by centre manager, Kate Jamieson, and operations manager, Chris Sciffer, to see firsthand how the budget delivers for families. The professionalism of the centre staff was evident for all to see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Thursday, we had a visit from a man who I think has the most challenging job in Australia, the Treasurer. He inherited a set of books from Labor mired in debt and deficit. The Treasurer was warmly received in my electorate, which is home to 30,000 small businesses. Like me, he grew up in a small business family and he understands that real initiative and wealth generation in this country comes from men and women who run small businesses and who are prepared to have a go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, yesterday we had the icing on the cakeâ€”pretty much literallyâ€”with the Prime Minister visiting Dolci Sapori, a small business in Brisbane which makes the finest traditional Italian desserts you are ever likely to find. And, thanks to the government's small business package announced in the budget, Aladino Pozzebon from Dolci Sapori will be able to refrigerate his delivery van and he will be able to expand his business. That is what this government is all about. It is about rewarding people to have a go, and in Brisbane there is no shortage of people who want to have a go and build the economy.</span>

Winton Motor Raceway is open 50 weeks of the year, seven days a week. It employs 30 people full-time, and on race days over 350 officials and close to 200 volunteers. On average it has 300,000 visitors per year, with an estimated regional impact of $36 million per year. With the V8 three-day event last weekend, $15 million and 185 full-time jobs were invested into our economy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  Last week was a wonderful week for us in the Deakin electorate. We had the opportunity to celebrate some wonderful local small business stories. The Minister for Small Business, Bruce Billson, came to my electorate and toured a number of small businesses in East Ringwood with me. It was great to speak to them about our small business package. For once we have a government whose rhetoric is matched by its actions. Our small business package, and in particular tax cuts for small business and accelerated depreciation, is going to give small businesses the shot in the arm they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the opportunity to visit Bill and Mary at Cafe Emjay in East Ringwood, who already make a wonderful coffee but are expanding their business. They are investing in new plant and equipment and an upgrade of their kitchen is certainly coming soon. The accelerated depreciation rates that will apply to all of that plant and equipment will certainly help them invest what they need to to grow their business. It is not just about growing business for the sake of itâ€”it creates new jobs and new opportunities for our local economy and young people who want to get into the workforce. We also had a chance to visit Daisy's Garden Suppliesâ€”Evan Mulcahy and his team there do an absolutely outstanding job, and our package will enable them to invest more into their business. I thank the small business minister for visiting, and I want to thank Bill and Mary at Cafe Emjay and Evan at Daisy's Garden Supplies. Small business is the heart of our local economy and we will support it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  On Friday I was very pleased to welcome the member for Sydney, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to the Scullin electorate. I was even more pleased to introduce her to the students and school community at St Monica's College in Epping. I wanted to bring together the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and St Monica's because of the school's deep and abiding interest in social justice and, as one of the teachers put it to me, the students' keen awareness of and interest in a world that is beyond Epping. It was terrific to bring together a question and answer session with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition which focused principally on questions of foreign affairs. Many questions on international development and our overseas aid budget were raised, with a particular focus on and a particular concern about the deep cuts contained in this government's budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course a wider range of questions were asked by students, all of which were deftly answered. Through the course of this conversation I was struck by a couple of things. Firstly, while we are often cynical about the attitude of young people to the political process, the young students that we encountered were deeply aware of contemporary political issues. Secondly, it was evident to me, in large part due to the quality and respectful nature of the conversation with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that these students were keen to find ways through which they could participate more closely in reshaping their community and indeed their world. I thank all at St Monica's, particularly co-captains Ryan Bolger and Nicole <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    color:#141823;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Kotsopoulos</span>, Campus Director Paula Di Maria and Public Relations Manager Peter Cox for the warm and generous welcome.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  Last week I visited many small businesses in Taree and Port Macquarie to talk about our recently released 2015 budget and the jobs, small business and family packages. These changes were very happily received. I had the opportunity of visiting Fineline Motorcycles in Taree. Not only did I visit a humming little business but I got to meet Alex Cudlin, five-times world endurance champion, brother of Damian, also another world endurance bike riding champion, and his parents, Shane and Annette who, like many people in the Manning, moved up from Sydney many years agoâ€”they turned in their police motorbike job and started their own small business. They put their heart and soul into it, and they and their customers will benefit from the accelerated depreciation arrangements for small business. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, Danny and Allison Lambert at D&amp;A Benchtops in Wauchope have put their heart and soul and their family's mortgage into their benchtop business, and now, having started from scratch 11 years ago, they have 11 people working for them. They have done very well. I also got to meet Will J Frost, who saw a niche position in the market to supply small parts for the trailers of Australia. Now he has a large infantry up there in Taree, and if you need any trailer parts for your trailer, Menn-in Trailers is the place to get them from. Congratulations to all those people. They are going to benefit from our small business package. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Catherine Hill Bay is the smallest of the five surf clubs in the Shortland electorate. They have 280 adult members, 148 juniors and a very impressive 21 cadetsâ€”who represent the future of the club. They also have 14 trainers, four assessors and three facilitators. A total of 527 awards were gained this season. They completed 14 rescues, 372 preventative actions, 39 first aid actions and closed the beach nine times over the season, as well as performing 4,975.75 patrol hours, which have an estimated value of $99,515 to Lake Macquarie City Council.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The surf club has seen tough times in the past. I can remember attending a presentation at which there were more dignitaries than members of the club. It has grown, it is strong and it provides vital services in the area. Not only do they look after the beach, they are also required to hop in and help when rock fishermen are swept into the water. My congratulations to the club.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  Last Wednesday I farewelled James 'Jim' Cominos, a well-loved family and community man who arrived in Australia in 1951. Originating from the Greek island of Kythera, Jim was the second child in a family of six and, from an early age, showed compassion, persistence and an unwavering commitment to helping others. After several years in my electorate of Barton, Jim, like many Greek migrants who arrived post war in Australia, started a milk bar business with his two brothers. Soon Jim's prowess as a businessman in running a succession of highly successful milk bars attracted offers of a real estate career. Despite running a business full time, Jim always found the time to help others in need, especially migrants settling into life in Australia. Jim was always community minded and ready to lend a hand to others, not just Greek migrants. As a result of this, the Cominos reputation still stands today, with legions of people fondly recalling the way Jim helped them over the years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Jim relocated from Blacktown to Brighton-Le-Sands, he became active in the local churchâ€”the Greek Orthodox Parish Community Church of Kogarah and Districtâ€”for the next 20 years. I had the huge privilege of working alongside Jim from 1998, when we both sat on the board of the local aged-care provider and of the Kogarah Greek Orthodox parish. Jim's passion and exemplary work ethic have always stayed with me. Jim was a model migrant and an accomplished individual. His passion, commitment and compassion will always be remembered by his family and the community at large. Vale Jim Cominos.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  There appears to be a theme arising out of the 90-second statements being made by government backbenchers. Lots of people from marginal seats are standing up and talking about fly-in fly-out visits by ministersâ€”all talking about small business. I have to ask why no-one turned up in Bendigo? There were no ministers turning up in Bendigo. Perhaps Bendigo has been knocked off the Liberal Party list. Perhaps they no longer care about Bendigo. </span>

You know it is a shocking government when there are not one but two protests happening in Bendigo on the same day. The first was by CPSU Centrelink staff. They stopped work in protest at the fact that this government is reducing their pay. Not only have they offered really low wage increases of zero to one per cent, they are also trying to cut family leave. Centrelink staff stopped work to say, 'Restore the casual hours, bring back job security and put a decent deal on the table.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second protest was about Australia Postâ€”the changes going on in Australia Post and the fear that those changes will result in post offices closing and job losses. We have already seen jobs lost in Bendigo as a result of this government's policiesâ€”and they have to stop.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  Today I pay tribute to the government's Manufacturing Transition Programme and the positive contribution it makes to Australian manufacturing and the wider community. This programme provides funding to drive investment in new capital equipment and improvements to plant and processes which deliver a growth that builds on Australia's competitive advantage. I am pleased to announce that OneHarvest has secured a $1.775 million grant to develop an innovative way of processing salads that will dramatically increase the quality and safety of salads without the detrimental effect of heat or chemical preservatives traditionally used in production. The grant is part of a $7 million project that will be housed adjacent to the $34 million fresh-cut salad facility that is currently under construction in Smeaton Grange.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is great news for Macarthur because it will create around 100 new jobs when the plants are fully operational in June 2017. It has provided employment for a variety of tradespeople during the construction and fit-out phase, with 297 tradespeople inducted on the site. I had the pleasure of visiting the site on Friday and was amazed by the scale and ambition of the project. OneHarvest's decision to embark on this project in Smeaton Grange is a ringing endorsement for our region and proves that Macarthur is fast becoming a hub for businesses and industries in south-west Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">OneHarvest has been a leader in fresh produce for three generations, supplying Australian consumers with fresh, healthy and fabulous-tasting fruit and vegetables from across the country. We warmly welcome them to Macarthur. I would like to thank Brenda Walker, General Manager of OneHarvest, for flying down from Queensland at such short notice to meet with me, and Tim Evans, site manager for Wiley, for kindly showing us around the site.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  I want to report to the House about a rally that was held at the Wollongong mall on Saturday with about 300 locals. We gathered to express our extreme displeasure at the decision by Fairfax Media to cut 50 jobs from papers across our region, including a savage 24 from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Illawarra Mercury</span>, and combining the local papers the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Wollongong Advertiser</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lake Times</span>. The jobs include journalists, photographers and commercial staff. The rally was addressed by Andy Zakeli, the MEAA rep at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Illawarra Mercury</span>; Kirk Gilmour, a Walkley-winning photographer; Sylvia Liber, another Walkley-winning photographer there; Antony Field, editor of the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Wollongong Advertiser</span>, Geoff Morrell, Federal President of Actors' Equity; me and the member for Throsby; and Gareth Ward, the Liberal member for Kiama. Also there was Anna Watson, the Labor member for Shellharbour in the state parliament. Mayor Gordon Bradbery spoke. Marianne Saliba, the Mayor of Shellharbour, was there as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We sometimes lovingly call the <span style="font-style:italic;">Illawarra Mercury</span> the 'mockery'. We do that because we are happy to take issue with them when we need to but, like a family, we gather when they are attacked from outside. I note that the member for Gilmore is here, and I am sure she endorses those sentiments. It is a great local paper. It has been doing great work for us as a region for 160 years. These cuts are way beyond anything that is acceptable. We absolutely call on Fairfax Media to reject them and to rethink this very stupid decision.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  I rise to talk about a man whose passion for Midland's future as a vibrant community and in business is unsurpassed. Graeme Harris, or 'Mr Midland', is passionate about the town of Midland, its people and its surrounding region. It is a key entry point to the city of Perth for the Wheatbelt and regional Western Australia. Graeme established his business in Midland over 30 years ago when the local abattoir, brickworks and Western Australian government railway workshops provided most of the jobs and apprenticeships within the region. Graeme, in conjunction with the City of Swan and the Swan Chamber of Commerce and with the support of state and federal members, has continued to work to improve the opportunities within the Midland region. They work and combine together to ensure the establishment of the new Midland Public Hospital, the proposed St John of God private hospital and the Curtin medical school for training doctors, nurses and allied health professionals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Graeme Harris is a treasure for Midland. In every community, there are similar leaders who aspire to build a better future for their local community. I acknowledge Graeme's endeavours to build a vibrant region in Midland. But, more importantly, when you have people who have that passion for their community, it enhances the way in which people connect and the way in which the community grows. It gives the community a vibrancy in terms of being a place of meaning and a place of richness in the tapestry that exists in the Midland region. I acknowledge Graeme for the work that he does.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  I rise to congratulate Ireland after the Irish people voted in favour of marriage equality over the weekend. The result was clear: 62 per cent of people voted in favour of amending the country's constitutionâ€”an extraordinary result. So it was very disappointing to hear the Prime Minister immediately rule out marriage equality in Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time the Prime Minister woke up and listened to what the Australian people want. It is time the Prime Minister put his own beliefs out of the way and gave his MPs and senators a conscience vote on this issue so that the national parliament can decide. This is an issue that the majority of Australians support, and the parliament should reflect that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own eyes, before the law of this Commonwealth all women and men should be equal, no matter their colour, creed or sexual orientation. People have the right to choose the individual they love, and if they choose to marry the state should not stand in their way. That is why I voted to support same-sex marriage in the past, and that is why I will continue to support it in the future. It is time for the coalition party room to give this serious issue the time and respect it deserves. It is time the Prime Minister allowed a conscience vote for his MPs and senators on marriage equality.</span>

Community associations in the township of Officer have been fighting to regain theirs afters it was moved out of their local suburb. This is particularly important when you consider that Officer township is growing rapidly, with over 14 schools. Also, the local shire office is located there, it has a large shopping centre precinct coming, and an enormous increase in residential properties.</span>

I give a special thanks to Rob Porter, president of the Officer Community Association, Carol Porter, committee member, Jenny Stirling, assistant secretary of the OCA, and all members of the Officer Community Association. I stand here today to support them in their fight to have vital post office delivery services reinstated under the criteria mentioned earlier.

We hope that it is able to do that for 170 years. Last Saturday the member for Cunningham and I had the great pleasure of addressing a community rally in Wollongong. It is an unusual event that attracts the support of Labor members of parliament, state and federal, together with Liberal members of parliament from New South Wales, and independent members of the local council. The rally to support the <span style="font-style:italic;">Illawarra Mercury</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wollongong</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Advertiser</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lake Times</span> is such an important cause that it managed to bring together members of those three disparate persuasions. Whether it is stories of mine disasters or celebrations of sporting events, whether it is local stories about a student doing something extraordinary, or whether it is celebrating the effects of community coming together to support a local charity, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Illawarra Mercury</span> has been there.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  I would like to inform the House about a fundraising drive happening this weekend in my electorate and across the country. It is, of course, the return of the Salvos fantastic Red Shield Appeal doorknock. This excellent initiative has been running for 50 years, and over that time has helped millions of people. The appeal raises money that goes directly into the Salvation Army's work in alleviating poverty and supporting people who have fallen on hard times. Last year's appeal raised almost $80 million nationally, which make a massive difference to the lives of people who are facing difficulties. Organising the campaign locally has required a massive effort, so congratulations to everyone involved in the Ryde, Epping and Eastwood Salvos, and a particular thanks to all the volunteers who will give up their weekend to help out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was proud to launch the appeal last month at the Midway shops at the Meat Boutique shop, along with state members of Ryde, Victor Dominello MP and the mayor, Bill Pickering. This weekend I will be taking part in the campaign's conclusion, pounding the pavements of Eastwood as part of the door-knocking campaign. Similar groups will be out and about across the country, so please keep an eye out and give generously.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  It is no accident that the same man who worked tirelessly for two decades to end human slavery in the UK, Lord Wilberforce, also founded the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. If the measure of a government is how it treats the most vulnerable members of the community it governs then this government is failing badly not only with regard to the poorest and most disadvantaged people in our community but also in terms of its treatment of our animals. The revelation that Australian cattle are being killed with sledgehammers in Vietnam, our second largest live cattle export destination, is further evidence that this appalling trade should be suspended and our boxed meat trade expanded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The revelations of cruelty are not an accident or one-off; slaughtering via sledgehammer is the traditional method of slaughter in Vietnam. The Australian export industry knows this. The Department of Agriculture knows this. The minister knows this. Indeed, evidence of these brutal practices in Vietnam was first brought to the attention of the department two years ago and eight times since; however, rather than the government taking immediate investigative action two years ago and being very cautious with subsequent exports to Vietnam, live cattle exports to Vietnam have tripled in the past two years and exports are now being planned to Laos and Cambodia, countries which also practice slaughter by sledgehammer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems that there is no fate too cruel for Australian animals that would cause this government to pause in its exuberant promotion and expansion of this industry. Once again it is the animal welfare sector that is alone in bringing to light the brutality and mistreatment that live export inevitably involves.</span>

My thanks go to Mayor Lindsay Brown for providing an ideal venue for the morning's meeting in Moruya. Among the participants were doctors Linda Brown, Martin Carlson, Marjorie Cross, Melanie Dorrington, Ken Doust, Michael Holland, Paul Muskett and Jenny Wray. Pharmacists there included Peter Downing, Jim Hoar, Andrew Topp and Andrew White. Representing the Katungal Aboriginal Medical Service were Angela Nye and Joanne Grant. Professor Amanda Barnard of the ANU Rural Clinical School was there, and Dianne Kitcher, Christine Williams and Margaret Thornton represented the new primary health network. Also attending were Rob Bradley, Brad Rossiter, Russell Schneider and Janice Setter.</span>

Representing Katungal were Graham Moore and Jon Rogers. Finally, Jenny Symons, CEO of Banksia Village, brought her specialised knowledge of the aged-care sector. Also attending were Colin Dunn, Darryl Dobson, Jim Butterworth, Christine van den Berg and Sharon Bower-Smith. I would like to thank them all for participating in a very well regarded health review.</span>

Redhead is one of the largest surf clubs in the Shortland electorate. It has 804 members, 337 juniors and a very impressive 21 cadets. This assures their future. It has a big job at Redhead Beach; it is probably the most dangerous beach in the electorate, and Redhead surf club certainly rises to every occasion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The club has undertaken 16 rescues, 479 preventive actions and 65 first aid events and has had to close the beach 44 times this season. That shows just how dangerous the beach is. It has performed 4,144 patrol hours, and that is valued at $82,800 in volunteer hours to the local community. It is one of the strongest clubs on the beach. It competed at both the Australian titles and the national titles. I believe it is the ninth strongest club in the branch. They had two clubs in the top 10 at the state championship and were very impressive. The branch has 10 clubs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Fero Group are working hard to develop their business model and invest in the future growth of their business, which manufactures steel and anti-corrosion materials for the oil and gas, mining, civil, marine, commercial, industrial and residential industries. Last week I had the pleasure of meeting the organisation's founder, Mario, and his two sons, Michael and Robert Franco, and the chief financial officer, Len Troncone.

It was to inform the Fero Group that they had been successful in receiving a $4.9 million grant under the government's Manufacturing Transition Program to advance their manufacturing capability, because this government recognised the future growth potential of this local organisation. Despite this grant funding, this is a business that is moving ahead. Overall this is a $23.95 million project that Fero Group is investing in to design and build a new state-of-the-art highly automated galvanising plant which will ensure it remains a competitive and sustainable business both domestically and globally.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My thanks go to Mario, Michael and Robert for taking the time to show me around their impressive facility. I will be looking forward to returning in the near future when works are completed to once again highlight how manufacturing businesses such as this are working to generate growth, employment and industry sustainability.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  It is with sadness that I have to take the opportunity in the Parliament today to report the passing of an absolutely wonderful trailblazing woman. Toni Newman died on 29 March after a long battle with melanoma. She was a good friend, as was her partner, Dave Voltz. Many in this place will know Dave. I say she was a trailblazer because she was one of the country's first female apprentice electricians. In fact, Dave tells me that he first met her while playing pool at the Royal Oak Hotel, and he was particularly attracted because she was wearing a bib and brace and steel-capped boots. She obviously will be very sadly missed by her partner, Dave â€“ they had been together 28 years â€“ her parents, Win and Claire, who still live in our local area at Lake Heights, her sisters, Lesley â€“ and her partner, Greg â€“ Karen and Michelle, and her beloved nieces and nephews.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was very grateful for the care and expertise of Dr Carlino and the staff at Westmead Hospital. Toni loved Granville, where she made her home with Dave. She loved the Rabbitohs, she was a whiz of a quilter and she particularly felt that those she worked with at Clipsal-Schneider were good friends who provided great support to her during her illness from her workplace. She will be sadly missed by all of us, a real trailblazing woman.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  As a local sports enthusiast and someone who has always been involved in a number of local sporting clubs during my life, it gives me great pleasure to recognise a number of exciting young sports stars who call Hindmarsh home. Recently I hosted a local sporting champions presentation and it was great to meet some of these young sporting stars. Successful applicants represented an extremely broad range of sports, including surfing, lacrosse, cycling, athletics, figure skating, surf life saving, hockey, cricket and netball, to a name a few. What was most impressive was the number of recipients who are competing on an international stage with the events being held in countries such as Slovakia, Scotland, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and China. I would like to congratulate all of those who were successful in applying. I would also like to thank Bruce Djite from Adelaide United, who was my guest speaker at the local sporting champions presentation. Bruce, a local soccer star, said during his presentation that it takes dedication and resilience to excel in sport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, on Saturday night I attended two surf life saving club presentation nights â€“ Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club and then Grange Surf Life Saving Club. Grange have won 13 straight senior titles, a record hard to surpass both in Australia and probably internationally in sports. This year they also won the junior sports title. I congratulate them on their success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to pay tribute to many of the club members from both Glenelg and Grange who were recognised on the night. There are too many to mention, but I do remember a couple of names â€“ Richard Baker and Shane Gleeson. I also want to thank the club, in particular Robert and Heather Thompson, for their great hospitality. I look forward to working with the Grange Surf Life Saving Club on their redevelopment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  I rise to share with the House a few of the comments that the Catholic College of Bendigo raised with me during their visit to parliament the last time we sat. I asked the group whether there were any messages they would like me to pass on to the Prime Minister and his government. This group said to me that they would like to see more action on climate change, that they believed it was the role of the government to ensure that climate change was taken seriously and that action was taken. They also wanted to see greater support and funding for mental health programs, particularly in awareness and making sure that all young people have access to good support if they needed help with mental health. They also said that they wanted the government to take a more compassionate approach towards asylum seekers and those seeking protection and fleeing persecution. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue the group raised which we spoke at length about was youth unemployment. Half the group had part-time jobs and the other half of the group were looking for part-time jobs to help them through their studies. They also had worries about long-term unemployment, which affects a lot of young people in the region. The final issue the group raised with me was marriage equality. Put simply, they put it to a vote and every single hand was raised. They all said that they wanted this country to embrace and support marriage equality, that they wanted this parliament to give all of its members the opportunity to vote in a free and fair vote.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  The life of a politician certainly is not dull and you know you are in for a big week when you look at the calendar and an event says, 'Ann must wear Velcro.' So looking at the diary, among the village visits, school presentations, helping people with personal road blocks, emails, letters and running the media gauntlet, those words raised some degree of wariness. The event was the PCYC Time4Kids at Nowra Golf Club, a community fundraiser. I have been involved in this for three years. The reason I am to wear Velcro is that I will be having tennis balls thrown at me by those who would like to pay for the privilege. It is safe to say I will do almost anything for this particular group. For the young people, many of whom are just now engaging in positive activities for the first time, the PCYC is a great catalyst. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Shoalhaven Police Citizens Youth Club plays an important role in our community, engaging youth in after-school sport and building a strong relationship between police and young people, using a fantastic mix of activities including boxing, fitness, archery, sports competitions and the like. The PCYC are very good friends of mine. In fact, I have even been to jail for them, not once but twice. Last year they constructed a special jail in the car park of Stocklands Nowra where, in full prison stripes, I spent time behind bars. Some people offered to pay to keep me there. I said that they needed to pay double. It is a great place to meet other community leaders from business and defence. Thank you Andrew Flint, Rebecca, Nathan and Stephen for all the work you do. Was I blessed this time? The event was postponed as gumboots would have been required, but the Velcro event is still to come. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83S" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  I rise to speak on behalf of the frustrated commuters in my electorate whose daily struggle to get in and out of town has become a political plaything of Tony Abbott and the Liberal Party. This situation has gone completely beyond a joke. The Prime Minister declared the 2014 Victorian election a referendum on the East West Link. The Prime Minister lost that the referendum when Victorian voters elected the Andrews Labor government, which had promised to scrap the project. The then Prime Minister demanded that Labor break its promise and proceed with the project, a demand that reinforces the community's apprehension at this prime minister's casual relationship with promises and the truth. The Prime Minister then said that the Victorians elected their new government 'in a fit of absent mindedness'. And now, even though the Victorian government has cancelled the project, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have decided to rip $3 billion out of Victoria's infrastructure budget so that they can keep the money in a so-called 'locked box'. This is political petulance at its worst. The Abbott government has already given Victoria $1.5 billion of the $3 billion. This unfair budget proposes to take back $1.5 billion from Victorians' pockets and put it into Joe's pocket, to help him balance his deeply unfair budget. Victoria is the second most popular state in Australia. Victoria's continued economic success is vital to the economic health of the entire country, and good congestion-busting infrastructure is essential for Victoria and the Victorian economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why, then, have Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey relegated Victoria to such a low infrastructure priority? This budget only delivers $400 million for infrastructure for Victoria. That is a measly eight per cent of the federal government's infrastructure budget and merely $67 per person for Australia's most populous state. By contrast, New South Wales will soak up 39 per cent of the infrastructure budget, getting $7.7 billion, and Queensland getting $1.5 billion, which is equivalent to $309 per Queenslander. Victorians are being ripped off by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Commuters in my electorate are being ripped offâ€”and worse. Rather than seeking to find a solution to the congestion in the east of Melbourne and work with the Victorian government, Tony Abbott is playing political games. The only people soon to lose, as a result of these games, are the community of my electorate and the neighbouring electorate of Deakin. Driving to and from work on the Eastern Freeway, in peak hour, is a nightmare. In fact, it is a nightmare a lot of the time outside peak hour as well. I should knowâ€”I travel on it very regularly! On Sunday night, trying to get to the airport, you would think Sunday night traffic would be fine. But noâ€”as always, it was a nightmare. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that something needs to be done to relieve this congestion, but the East West Tunnel is notâ€”nor was it ever going to beâ€”the solution to this problem. The simple truth is that the former Liberal government of Victoria had a political problem. They had shelved all the planned and shovel-ready infrastructure projects left to them by the former Labor governmentâ€”and then, promptly, sat on their hands for more than half their term of office. Now, less than two years away from an election, the lack of any meaningful infrastructure investment or construction was threatening to confine them to opposition. So they dumped their leaderâ€”Ted Baillieu. Shortly after, in May 2013, new Premier Denis Napthine announced the East West Link. It was a project that he would start before the November 2004 election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to go back, because right here is where the problem begins with the East West Link. This is not a new project. My first job out of university was with VicRoads, the authority that builds roads. Without divulging my age, even though it is readily available, my first job out of university was a very long time ago! Actually, I was acquiring property for the extension of the Eastern Freeway then. Part of it was to put a rail link down the Eastern Freewayâ€”something the former Liberal government proposed and something I have been advocating for, for quite a long time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a new project. It is not something miraculousâ€”nor was it ever going to solve any of the congestion problems in the eastern suburbs. What it did do, to some extent, was shore up Liberal state seats in the east. It was first proposed, by Rod Eddington, in 2008, as being primarily a tunnel or bridge for trucksâ€”a tunnel for trucksâ€”carrying freight to the Port of Melbourne. Rod Eddington assessed that the most urgent need was for the inner west to the port, providing an alternative to the West Gate Bridge, a tunnel under or a bridge over the Maribyrnong River, connecting to a northern bypass of the city. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Napthine Liberal government did not adopt this approach. Instead, looking to marginal seats in Melbourne's east, they focused on the east-west tunnel, falsely promising commuters that this tunnel connection would reduce congestionâ€”even though their own modelling showed it would not. This is because most commuters exit at Hoddle Street. I know this is not exciting for everybody outside of Victoria but it is for everybody in the eastern suburbs! It is the trucks that need to move west to the port and the airport. It is the commuters who need to get into town. This was never going to resolve the issue for my residents trying to get to work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Napthine government was never prepared to be honest about it. It still is not prepared to be honest about it, nor is this current federal government. Nowhere is it prepared to be honest about the fact that at best estimates the economic return of this truck tunnel would deliver just 45c in the dollar to Victoria. This was a $10 billion project, rushed by a desperate Liberal government, and flawed from the start. The Napthine government did everything possible to conceal the crucial details of the project. Then, when things looked dire and the looming election all but lost, Treasurer Michael O'Brien committed an act of bastardry: signing a side letter to the consortium who won the contractâ€”guaranteeing compensation if the contract were cancelled. This is shameful politics at its worst: an unnecessary letter, the sole purpose of which was to sabotage the Andrews Labor government. There were political games right from the start and all the way through. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we are today: a project cancelledâ€”as promised by the Daniel Andrews Labor government before the electionâ€”a contract entered two weeks before going into caretaker mode and a Prime Minister determined to keep the game alive while commuters suffer in their cars. The Prime Minister is refusing to invest in public transport despite the fact that Melbourne's Metro rail tunnel is No.1 on Infrastructure Australia's priority list. Whilst it seems to some that it would not help commuters from the east, it wouldâ€”because people from the east want to get on a train and want to get into town. Having better connectivity in Melbourne would assistâ€”more trains travelling all the time. We cannot drive our way out of congestion. We need alternatives to more traffic and we need more public transport options so that more people have more genuine choices about how they travel. That is why I like light rail down the Eastern Freeway. It was probably the best option and one previously committed to by the state Liberal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister needs to stop the games and consider alternative projects that will actually relieve congestion in the east, but he is so opposed to this that he will not even consider allowing funding to be diverted to remove level crossingsâ€”which is ostensibly a road project. The removal of level crossings in my electorate has already produced greater traffic flow and taken away much congestion. Previously, the Labor state government removed the level crossing at the intersection of Whitehorse Road and Springvale Road and the one at Middleborough Road, creating great outcomes for motorists. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is needed is long-term solutions, not easy fixes which are all about winning elections. Putting large amounts into one project so that nothing else is able to be built or done in Victoria for a very long time is not the way to go. Rather than agree to any of the many requests from Premier Daniel Andrews for a meeting, Tony Abbott instead sent his finance minister, Mathius Cormann, to meet with the Victorian Leader of the Opposition at a cafe in Spring Streetâ€”while the Prime Minister launched a billboard. Instead of actually doing anything, the Prime Minister came down to Ringwood and stood in front of a billboard. He talks about getting rid of congestion but is doing absolutely nothing about it. Indeed, he is doing less than nothing, because he has taken away every infrastructure dollar from Victoria. It is these kinds of cheap political stunts that leave commuters and my electorate in complete despair. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone keeps talking about how infrastructure should be beyond politics. Now is the time for the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, to prove he actually believes that. Put politics aside and find constructive solutions to the traffic congestion in the eastern and western suburbsâ€”not a truck tunnel that was never going to relieve traffic congestion for people trying to get to work on a daily basis. It would be good to see the Prime Minister become the infrastructure Prime Minister he claims he wants to be.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWE" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMPKINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  Today I raise concerns about the circumstances of certain migrant communities in Australia. Last week I was speaking at a local citizenship ceremony and I said to those new Australian citizens that Australia was not a lucky country but rather a land of opportunity. Unlike places where recent migrants come from, here it does not matter what religion you are, what the colour of your skin is or what family you are part of. Here it is about the content of your character and your desire to succeed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Descendants of today's migrant families should make great and positive contributions to Australia, particularly in terms of economic activity. What worries me is that the potential of migrants to contribute is being held back by the approach of the systemâ€”and also, in some cases, by themselves. By 'the system' I mean the so-called support mechanisms that are provided and the enduring philosophical approach that migrants should be provided with the sorts of support that allow them to remain, unfortunately, isolated in society. All here are aware of the 510 hours of English language training provided to skilled, family and humanitarian migrants by the government and funded by the taxpayerâ€”and that is good. It must be very difficult to learn a new language and, particularly as an adult, sitting in classes all day must be challenging. Yet, in order to ensure such migrants are supported, any time they need an interpreter to access government services such as Centrelink, they are provided with one. In other words, we provide classes for English but limited reasons to learn or use it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, there are shops and shopping centres owned by migrants, often in areas where recent arrivals live, that speak the language of the migrants in preference to English. I put forward the proposition that this is in fact allowing a parallel society to operate and this is bad for society as a whole. An example of this occurring is that a person on welfare or even working at a market garden owned by someone who speaks their language could get up each day and go to work or even to Centrelink and speak their language. Then they can go to the shops owned by a person of the same background to buy food and still use the same language, then come home again and speak their native language to their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point I make is that we need to change our approach. Otherwise, by trying to be nice, supportive and culturally aware, we create a parallel society of isolation. This means that the chances of employment become very limited, the chances of negative cultural impacts like inequality of the genders become more prevalent and this all happens at a cost to the economic potential of the nation and is paid for by the taxpayers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To combat this system we should have a new system of practical application of English language training. For those who have professions an element of English language should be along those professional parameters. For those without a profession there should be more community based interactions to encourage confidence in everyday life. I also say that we should give migrants two years to complete this English language training and, after that, if they need an interpreter then they should pay that bill themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, the president of the Vietnamese community in Western Australia said to me, 'The way to get people to speak English is to stop the free interpreter service; then they will learn.' The English language training provided currently is not mandatory but must be taken up within six months and completed within five years of arrival or getting a visa if they want it. I say that, if you are receiving a taxpayer funded welfare payment, you should have to register for English language training within three months and complete it within two years of commencing. That would mean about five hours a week. Welfare payments should depend on participation in these courses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When others talk on such matters it is sadly the case that there is the fear of being called racist. Debate is therefore stifled. In many ways the overriding factor behind so many of these errors is that there is a wish to avoid being seen to discriminate against migrants and, as a consequence, the system or the philosophy of our interactions is driven by a desire to ensure migrants can maintain their culture. This maintenance becomes a higher priority than integration into the Australian society with all its opportunities. By providing a system that allows some groups to establish the arrangements they had in their old country, we are not helping but hindering them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is of course not just the system that helps to isolate some groups; it is also the groups themselves. Personal responsibility applies, and none of what I have spoken of already ensures isolation or a parallel society, but it is ensured by an unwillingness to participate in mainstream society. An example of this was provided to me by a friend who works in a multicultural centre for women in Perth. She asked a group of women who were speaking other languages why it was that after several years in Australia they did not speak English. The reply was: 'Why should we? If we ever need English, you will just provide us with an interpreter.' This is a prime example of an unwillingness to participate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think that an unwillingness and therefore an inability to communicate in English allows the negatives in migrant cultures to continue because the examples of better ways are not clear to them. Australia is of course a great and successful migrant nation. Over the generations since 1788, people have come here and made a good life for themselves. I believe that in Western Australia and specifically Cowan there are great examples of migrant communities that work hard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think it is safe to say that I can generalise about a couple of groups that do know how to work hard and achieve success. To name a few, I would say that the Vietnamese people in Cowan work very well. They are involved in horticulture, they are shopkeepers and they are professionals. They are a wonderful example of people who make a great contribution to Australia. I would also talk of the refugees who have come from Burma such as the Karens and the Chins. Again, they work hard and, whilst often not in the professions due to the mismanagement of the military regime in Burma, are prepared to work long hours and be successful. I also highlight the small Burundian community in Perth. They have strongly sought the opportunities that they have achieved in Australia. They value higher education and home ownership as the markers of success. My final example is the many Gujaratis in Western Australia, many of whom are very successful and own small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I contrast this hard work and antiwelfare approach with others. There are some people in this country who just see welfare as some sort of job option. Some have been here a long time, some not so long, but still there are those who see the welfare system, a support system, as something that is to be worked and manipulated, a system that is designed to help out the most needy and the most deserving but instead is used by some people with their lies and scams to take the taxpayers' cash and never give anything back to the nation in return. I, of course, deplore those that rip off the welfare system and all conduct by those whose only effort is to get taxpayers' funds that they are not entitled to or deserving of. I think most Australians agree with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was recently talking to some friends of mine from an immigrant community. They talked about people who they knew of who were ripping off state housing in Perth. They told me of a couple who got divorced and ended up getting a second Homeswest house, but instead they moved back into one house together while he rented out the other one to friends. Another example is the 'family' of a man and three or four women. Apparently, in this Centrelink fraud arrangement, the man is 'married' to one of the women, another is a sister and another a cousin, and all are on welfare payments like parenting payment single. The picture that has been painted for me by people in these migrant communities is that it is a multiple-wife scenario and certainly a maximum taxpayer rip-off scenario. This is absolutely the sort of case where, in the pursuit of fraud, we must do more. Firstly, as I always do, I encourage those that suspect these crimes to report them to the Centrelink fraud tip-off line on 131524. From a policy perspective, I say that we should DNA test these 'extended' families. If they are not related, then this scenario is a multiple marriage and fraud rip-off situation. I am informed that this is, unfortunately, widespread throughout the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next matter I want to speak of is the disturbing Farah 4 Kidz rip-off. This was a report on <span style="font-style:italic;">Today Tonight</span> from Adelaide that has caused concern among many of my constituents, who have contacted me. Farah 4 Kidz is a family day care business where child swapping and made-up names are used to rip taxpayers off. That is a well-known rip-off that I have raised with the minister. When I raised it with him back in March, he told me that action was being taken. I am, therefore, pleased that, since that time, Farah 4 Kidz has been suspended as an operator and that there will be a regulation that will ensure this child-swapping rip-off is brought to an end. It is a sad indictment that the systems that are put in place to assist those in most need are being ripped off by some people. I know that the ripping off and stealing from the taxpayers is not confined to any one group, but I find it particularly disappointing that those that come from nations with no welfare system at all and seek to come here for the opportunities choose instead, in some cases, to rip off the system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a great and generous country. I have never been anywhere in the world that I think is better. It is right that we have the safety net of a welfare system, but it is also the duty of every user of the system to do the right thing. It is very sad that some people see this generosity as something to be taken advantage of. I would welcome more prosecutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken on two themes todayâ€”about the mistakes the system makes and the criminality of others. To ensure the best future for migrants, we must end the isolation and encourage contribution. If we do not do so, they will not have the success that they rightly should.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3C" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  I rise today in this grievance debate to talk about how aggrieved Australia feels that George Brandis is the Attorney-General and Minister for the Arts. Has there ever been a minister more incompetent and detested by his own stakeholders than Minister Brandis? He is the Attorney-General who believes people should have the right to be bigots but does not believe journalists should be free from internet and smartphone surveillance to report in the public interest, free from the fear of endangering their sensitive sources. He is the arts minister who says he believes in freedom of speech but not the ability of Australian artists do their work and speak truth to power, free from the fear that they will have their funding pulled if they offend the personal arts fiefdom that the minister is erecting for himself. He is the arts minister who does not believe in the freedom of persecuted refugees to seek asylum on our shores but thinks big business should be free to bring in overseas workers in film and television to undermine our own cultural capital and employment opportunities for local creatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For this arts minister and this Attorney-General, war is peace, freedom is bigotry and ignorance is strength. Minister Brandis likes to talk about freedom, but for him freedom means defending people like Andrew Bolt while attacking this country's best journalists, who break stories in the national interest. For him, freedom means his freedom to pick and choose his personal pet arts projects while threatening the rest of our artistic community with funding cuts if they step out of line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's get into specifics. Under Arts Minister George Brandis, Australian art has endured acute and political attacks. In their first budget last year, Arts Minister Brandis and the coalition government cut $28.2 million out of the Australia Council.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, in their second budget, the coalition government has cut even more funding from the council. This time around they are suffering total cuts of $110 million. Arts Minister Brandis has taken this money out of the council and redirected it straight into the coffers of his own department. The repossession of Australian Council's Creative Partnerships Australia, Visions of Australia, Festivals Australia, Major Festivals Initiative, and the creation of the National Centre for Excellence in the Arts, will mean that grants from this new fund will seemingly be decided at the discretion of the Arts Minister of the day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the Arts Minister who has previously argued that art will always provoke debate. He said: 'That's why we have an arms-length and peer-reviewed structure for the allocation for the funding'. But this move does the exact opposite. In this one budget measure he has undermined the past 42 years of success in artist-centred, peer-reviewed funding, operating at arm's length from the government of the day. This begs the question: what art will now be funded?â€”given that George Brandis now has the final tick off of where our arts funding goes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to this, he has cut $3.6 million from the already underfunded Screen Australia, the Commonwealth's main film support body. This is on top of the $25.1 million cut out of Screen Australia last year. Together, these moves have led to Screen Australia, Screen Producers Australia and the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance to all say that the screen industry will be will be seriously affected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He has also cut $4 million from galleries and museums, including the National Gallery of Australia, the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, the National Museum and the National Portrait Gallery; and a further $7.3 million in 'efficiency dividends' by reducing funding to programs like ArtStart and Artists-in-residence programs. These are core programs that directly contribute to the development of future arts leaders and provide crucial opportunities for arts practitioners to gain real industry skills. These are an investment in the ongoing vibrancy and vitality of the arts sector, helping to shape arts leaders such as Fiona Menzies from Creative Partnerships Australia, Sandra Willis of Opera Australia, Beverly Growden of Canberra Glassworks, and Lou Oppenhiem of Circus Oz.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of Brandis' cuts to Australian arts have led to prominent and respected Australians, like Robert Manne, Lisa Dempster, Christos Tsiolkas, Van Badham and Benjamin Law, writing an open letter to the Arts Minister, calling for him to reverse these changes. The letter is signed by more than 100 Australians involved in the arts, and many more who share their passion for the arts and their concerns about the future of the arts under this Arts Minister and this government. The letter concludes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Minister Brandis seems to be under the impression that Australian culture is monolithic â€“ that there is only one way to be a proper Australian artist. The vibrancy and diversity of Australian arts indicate that nothing could be further from the truth. The many small arts organisations across the country â€“ galleries, libraries, theatre groups, performers and publications that are most at risk from funding cuts â€“ are the primary cultivators of Australian culture, fostering the early work of those artists we now celebrate, such as Christos Tsiolkas and Margaret Olley. But small arts organisations are also a merit in and of themselves. They allow millions of diverse individuals to imagine, collaborate and participate in culture-making. Democracy is founded upon reflection, civic participation, and hope. Art provides space for all of this and more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This Budget is an enormous blow to the arts community in Australia. It will impoverish Australian culture and society. It will mean loss of livelihood for many arts workers. It will mean many important artworks â€“ works that would inform national debate, expanding the possibilities of this country and its citizens â€“ will simply never be made. In 2011, the arts sector directly employed 531,000 people, and indirectly created another 3.7 million jobs. In 2008â€“9, the arts contributed $86 billion (7%) to the Australian GDP. Artists are workers and taxpayers, and a vital part of the economy. They are also consumers and lovers of art and culture. They should not be penalised for contributing so passionately to Australia's cultural ecosystem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We call on the Federal Government and Minister for the Arts George Brandis to reverse all proposed cuts to the arts sector â€¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We ask that you oppose defunding the art sector, particularly smaller organisations and practitioners â€“ that is, a whole generation of artists, writers, publishers, editors, theatre makers, actors, dancers and thinkers across Australia. We ask that you help us to continue building a world where culture and art is possible for everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the end of their letters. As someone passionate about the arts and their power to make us feel, learn and better understand ourselves and the world, as a proud Melburnian, as the representative of one of Australia's cultural and artistic centres and as the Greens spokesperson for the arts, I stand proudly with these Australians and call on George Brandis, as the arts minister, to reverse his cuts and invest in and value the arts for what they deserve. Not only has he cut millions of dollars out of the arts; George Brandis has also made moves to deregulate labour standards for the importation of overseas workers in film and television. The government is seeking to undermine the 420 subclass entertainment visa which protects roles for Australian workers on taxpayer-subsided film and TV productions. This move would undercut our cultural capital and the precious few employment opportunities in the industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is not just in his role of arts minister that George Brandis has disappointed. As Attorney-General, he has had some equally shocking moments and has led even farther-reaching attacks. If you thought that the Attorney-General's attacks on working women were limited to the director of the Human Rights Commission, Gillian Triggs, then you were wrong. The Attorney-General does not want any women to get more superannuation. As in many areas, there is a gender gap when it comes to Australians' super. On average, women end up with $44,000 in their super accounts while men, on average, have nearly double this at $82,000.  The Greens have taken steps to make it easier for employers to pay their women employees more super, but the Attorney-General has written to me and said that the government will not support us in our moves to make it easier to even up the balance between men and women when it comes to super.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, it is not just women that the Attorney-General has failed. He has sold out all Australians with his mass surveillance and data retention laws. Under George Brandis, every Australian has been turned into a suspect. There used to be a basic presumption that, unless you were suspected of having done something wrong, the government had no right to know who you were talking to or where you were at any particular time. In one fell swoop, this Attorney-General has put an end to that. Under the new laws, internet and smartphone data will be kept for two years, even if you are not suspected of having done anything wrong, and if you are a journalist trying to protect your sources then you are in trouble.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Australian citizen has been turned into a suspect by this Attorney-General â€“ all of this by an Attorney-General who could not even describe what metadata was. Many of us remember watching that excruciating interview. Watching our Attorney-General try and explain metadata was like watching my dog try to play chess. It was one of the most awkward several moments to sit through. This was the man who wanted to pass laws that would mean Australians would go to jail if they broke them and he could not even explain what those laws were. Why should Australians trust this man with all of their data? Why should the government spend hundreds of millions of dollars to store the personal information of every single one of its citizens? Let me say here that we, the Greens, will continue to be the real opposition to George Brandis and his anti-freedom agenda.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AN1" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOHN COBB</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:17</span>):  I rise at this opportunity to talk about a meeting I had last week with my forestry operations. I have to say at the outset that I think forestry is a magnificent productive sector of our country. It is totally sustainable. It employs local contractors and labour and it is part of the life cycle of man, the use of timber. Currently we use around $4 billion worth of timber in various forms, be that paper, building, furniture or whatever. Of that we actually import around 50 per cent, around $2 billion worth. I cannot speak for other states but certainly in New South Wales the majority is grown and harvested in state forests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My industry, which covers areas like Oberon, Lithgow, Bathurst, Mount Canobolas at Orange and Mullion Creek out in Cabonne, is a very healthy industry. It is run by good people and is well accepted in our part of the world, as indeed it should be everywhere. Forestry want more product. They want more trees. When you consider that we employ 50 per cent of what we use in any year and export very little. We are importing $2 billion worth at the moment. It is obvious why they want more product, even though at the moment they are being swamped, because the building trade in the rest of the world probably has not recovered quite as well as ours has.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So they are under a lot of pressure at the moment, but these guys are looking to the medium- to long-term and they are good operators. I actually have something like four millsâ€”Allied, who are also in Queensland, Borg, which was started 25 years ago by two brothers in their father's back yard, which are now two of the biggest producers of building material in Australia. Boral and Carter Holt Harvey are all good operations that are well run and well respected. I can tell you that Calare electorate does not want to see them go. In fact, we want them to increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that state forestry really do not have an option since Bob Carr took half the forestry land and put it into parks, they have lost country rather than gained it. So we cannot see this expansion coming from state forests. I think the state forestry guys would agree with that. In fact, the only real opportunity for expansion is not the big boys buying country for themselves and growing timber on it. No, because the economics do not go for buying. It is like Coles, Woolies and Westpac, which do not own their own real estate. By and large they lease it purpose-built for them. I think in this case the forest industry would really like to do deals with groups of farmers. It does not have to be the best land on the flats with the heavy soil. The good thing about timber is that it needs rain and a cool climate, but it does not have to be the best low lying land in the region. It can be the less productive land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who are worried about it taking over from agriculture need not be, for a couple of reasons. First, a farmer is not stupid. He will make economic choices about his business and about what he doesâ€”whether or not he is able to take a contract with a mill, or simply grow it himself on spec, with neighbours, but it does need to be close together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The international carbon accounting group now accepts that furniture and the like stores carbon. With this we are not talking multi-millions here, but given that it is at least 15 years before there is any return and before they thin itâ€”and they are lucky to break even doing thatâ€”at $13-odd, as I think the latest sale was for carbon, maybe they would get $100 per hectare in a year. Certainly they would not get that in the first five years, but perhaps by year 15 they would be getting it. They would get somewhat more until they do the second cut. At around 20 years they have much more serious timber and at 30-odd years, when they are getting the good wood, there would be more again, plus the value of the timber, of course.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the commercial timber industry gets a few bob, and I am talking about a few bob, it may be enough to go some of the way to paying for looking after it. With carbon accounting, given that the rules look likely to change, that would just be a good thing to make a farmer think about the land that maybe is not his best land but does have a good enough rainfall. At this point I have to say that the current ruling saying that 600 millimetres per year should be the cut-off point above which you cannot grow trees and have any carbon accounting at all, is a bit of nonsense put in by the previous leader of the Greens. I think her then deputy may not be the deputy anymoreâ€”he certainly is not the leader of the Greens. His ex-leader slapped that through at one stage. All that does is hurt the expansion and longevity of a really good industry. It is an excellent industry and, because it is so sustainable, it reinvents itself. It is not going to do harm to agriculture. To those who are worried about this sort of thing, it is nothing like an MIS. This is simply a few bob extra for carbon accounting which, a bit like rent, might help them get through the up to 20 years when they are first making some serious cutsâ€”and I am talking about pine here, obviously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am trying to get it across that this is not about a carbon sink. I think a carbon sink on any decent agricultural land is the most nonsensical thing I have ever heard of. Holding country up for 100 years, simply so that somebody can get a few carbon credits of one sort or another, is something I am not into and never will be. I am talking about the commercial industry that will be regenerated every 20 or 30 years. It will be an adjunct to what a farmer does. It will be an extra string to his bow; it will not take the place of agriculture. To those who are worried, as some might be in the sugarcane country, there is no way this industry could economically buy that sort of country. The price of carbon would have to be at around $100 to even think of it, and I do not think my Western Australian colleagues and I are ever going to see that happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mention this now because there are some who are worried about where the timber industry will go if it gets a few extra bob out of carbon accounting. It will not make it take over anything; it will make it more feasible; it will perhaps make some inroads into the 50 per cent of timber we use in Australia. The industry is currently worth $4 billion with $2 billion being importedâ€”and, at the moment, that is growing. This is a wonderful industry. We need to grow up about this, do the right thing and help it expand, in the same way as the rest of agriculture. To me, a farmer makes decisions based on his choice and needs, and he will do it when it comes to this as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="243609" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  May I say how pleased I am, Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon, to be receiving the call from you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister might call himself the 'infrastructure Prime Minister', but he is not fooling anyone, especially not those Australians, 80 per cent of us, who live in our increasingly congested cities. His infrastructure record to date is lamentable and his vision for the future bereft. In this contribution, I want to focus on critical infrastructure issues facing those living and working in the electorate of Scullin and the northern suburbs of Melbourne. These examples are, of course, important in themselvesâ€”they shape people's lives in a fundamental wayâ€”but they also illustrate a wider problem that affects four in five Australians, all of those who live in our cities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During last year's grievance debate, I spoke on a similar theme, and I cannot help but be disheartened and, indeed, angered by the lack of progress this government has made in delivering urban infrastructure. State governments, it is true, are acting, in Victoria by supporting the Melbourne Metro Rail Project and removing level crossings. In the Scullin electorate, Labor is proposing to extend the rail line to Mernda after four years of neglect by the Baillieu and Napthine governmentsâ€”responding to and anticipating the pressures of growth and recognising where the jobs are in Melbourne today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, these challenges are beyond the scope of any state government. This was highlighted last week with the release by Infrastructure Australia of its <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Infrastructure Audit</span>. Despite the Prime Minister and the assistant minister's attempts to put a positive gloss on the audit's release, the fact is that this is a document which damns this government's inaction and sets out the scale of its consequences. They are grave. The audit found that demand on many key urban road and rail corridors is projected to significantly exceed current capacity by 2031. The importance of managing urban transport is underlined by the fact that, in 2011, the cost of delays on road in the six largest capital cities was $13.7 billion. This figure is projected to grow by around 290 per cent to $53.3 billion in 2031 in the absence of appropriate strategies including integrating land use and transport planning, new road construction, additional public transport investment and the introduction of demand-management measures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Melbourne's north is very much on the frontline of these challenges. There is a lack of infrastructure here, but no lack of people. Indeed, recent Australian Bureau of Statistics figures put South Morang, which is in my electorate, as the fastest growing suburb in Australia, growing by 4,200 new residents in the year June 2013 to June 2014. I think of all the additional people trying to get parking at South Morang Railway Station in the morning; it is already virtually impossible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the Infrastructure Australia audit found that demand for public transport in the capital cities, as measured by passenger kilometres travelled, is set to rise by 121 per cent in Melbourne, and that, unless peak period passenger loads are managed and capacity is increased, commuters in all capital cities will see more services experiencing crush-loadings, where peak demand exceeds peak capacity. You would have to think that there would be urban infrastructure investment by any responsible government to match this population growth. Yet, as I mentioned in my previous debate contribution, the Abbott government has refused to contribute money to address this problem. They seem trapped by the Prime Minister's ideological aversion to public transport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is even worse than this. It is not just rail that the Abbott government refuses to fund. For years now, in my electorate, there has been a grass-roots-led campaign fighting for funding for the O'Herns Road interchange in Epping, led by the Aurora Community Association but supported by many thousands of local residents. There is currently only one street for residents in the Aurora community to leave their neighbourhood. Traffic slows to a crawl during peak times and will get even worse once the Epping food market is in full swing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Infrastructure Australia audit predicts that, in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane and Canberra, without investment in new transport capacity and/or the means of managing demand, car travel times are expected to increase by at least 20 per cent in the most congested corridors. In some cases, the report says, travel times could more than double between 2011 and 2031.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let us pause and think about what this means for people's livesâ€”their working lives and the time they get to spend for leisure and with their families. Victorian Labor supports, and has pledged to co-fund with the Commonwealth government, this O'Herns Road interchange upgrade. I note that various representations, including by me and my state colleagues, have been made to the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, but to no avail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems that the people of Melbourne's north will have to wait for a federal Labor government if they want to see increased funding of transport infrastructure where they live and where they work. But of course funding for projects like these should not be reliant on the political pendulum swinging towards Labor. In government, federal Labor sought to take the politics out of infrastructure funding by giving Infrastructure Australia the independence to weigh up which projects most deserved federal funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note in passing that Victorian Labor plans to establish a comparable organisation in Infrastructure Victoria. The Infrastructure Australia audit of last week stated that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Establishing a robust, accessible evidence base to support decisions on infrastructure reforms and investments is also critical. Without this evidence base, it is difficult for our governments, the private sector, and the wider Australian community to have a clear understanding of where the major challenges lie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the Abbott government has no regard for evidence based decision making. This is true across the board but particularly true in terms of urban Australia, where of course one of the first acts of this government was to abolish the Major Cities Unit. I note that one of the principal pieces of work which should inform our decision making in this regard is the <span style="font-style:italic;">State of Australian cities</span> report, supposedly an annual report, that was scheduled to be released for last year on 15 December 2014. We continue to await this report and the important evidence it would bring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But whether the evidence would change decision making is of course a moot point. In this regard, one only needs to observe the Abbott government's obsessiveâ€”indeed, irrationalâ€”support for the east-west tollway as an example. It is the other side of the Prime Minister's <span style="font-style:italic;">Battlelines</span> coin, matching the Prime Minister's personal distaste for public transport with the refusal to accept the verdict of the Victorian people last November. And, despite the evidence showing that this project will return, at best, 80 cents in the dollar and, at worst, 40 cents in the dollar, this most recent budget has committed $1.5 billion, in what is said to be a 'locked box', towards the East West Link rejected by the Victorian people. And of course in the lead-up to last year's Victorian election, the Prime Minister described the election as a referendum on the East West Link. Well, the people of Victoria have spoken, but the Abbott government refuses to listen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alan Kohler in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Business Spectator</span> last week said something very interesting, something the Prime Minister and all members of the government should reflect upon. He looked at the detail of the budget papers and he found that details show a real decline in spending in the infrastructure and regional development portfolio of 11.2 per cent between the present financial year and 2018-19. This is the real truth that pulls apart the fiction the government pedals of being an infrastructure government led by this self-described infrastructure Prime Minister. It demonstrates a profound failure at two levels; of prioritising, of course, with prejudice overcoming evidence in terms of decision making. But it is worse than this. It is also the case that levels of investment, of productive investment, just are not fit for purpose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Boosting our productivity of course requires a national approach to urban policy, including appropriate infrastructure investment in road and rail projects. But it is about much more than this. It is about sustainability and it is about livability. It is about enabling people to have more work and leisure choices to be able to spend more time with their families and their friends, and not to be stuck in traffic with all the pressures that that entails. Some of the challenges that social and physical isolation can have on communities are evident in Scullin. I am sure that they would be evident too in some of the communities in Holt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Long commutes cost time and money. They put people under pressure. All of us know all too often how this pressure can manifest itself in grotesque forms, putting real pressure on communities and families. The stakes for properly connecting outer suburban communities are very, very high. All of us in this place owe an obligation to the communities we represent to connect the people who live in them more effectively to jobs, to schools, to hospitals and to opportunities more generally. I am determined to keep making the case for better urban infrastructure for the people who live and work in Melbourne's north, and also for a better and fairer way to ensure that all Australians get the infrastructure they need to lead decent lives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="217266" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PRENTICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  I am truly fortunate to represent an electorate that contains some of the most brilliant medical researchers in our country. I have spoken before in this place about several exciting research projects that have been generated by experts at the University of Queensland. I have spoken about Professor Jurgen Gotz and his team and their breakthrough in non-invasive ultrasound technology, showing promise in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. I have spoken of Ian Frazer and his Gardasil vaccine that has revolutionised the prevention of cervical cancer. I have spoken on several occasions about the nano patch, a new needle-free vaccine delivery mechanism that will be a game-changer in disease prevention, particularly in the developing world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We often hear in the media from fundraising groups and from researchers themselves about potential breakthroughs in the prevention, treatment or cure of many common diseases. Indeed, with the significant enhancements in research methods such as computerised modelling and advances in genomics, there is no shortage of new and exciting research being published. In the area of basic research, Australia punches above its weight. With just 0.3 per cent of the world's population, we manage to produce three per cent of the world's research. But in reality only a small fraction of promising research ever ends up completing the process of becoming a commercially available drug.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of great ideas simply fall by the wayside. Some do not progress for perfectly valid reasons such as failed clinical trials. But for many more, development slows to a halt as victims of a phase of development, some researchers have darkly termed the 'valley of death'. The more technical term for this phrase of drug development is translational medical research. Turning a good idea into a product is a multistage process. Research must proceed through many time-consuming stages before research reaches market, including several stages of clinical trials. It is not uncommon for the entire process to take a decade or more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a costly process. Researchers require funding to further their work. Once research passes from an idea to a potentially marketable commodity, funding is often no longer available from research institutes and universities. So researchers turn to pharmaceutical companies for backing. But these companies are risk-averse and, with limited research and development funding, they will only back the drugs that have the greatest chance of commercial success in relation to development cost, with an inherent bias towards drugs already approaching the end of the development cycle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, this problem is compounded by two additional challenges. The first is our demographic: Australia has a small population compared to the United States and Europe. This means a smaller pool of patients from which to draw participants in clinical trials, which can delay trials or result in them being conducted overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second challenge is an underdeveloped venture capital market in Australia, which suffers in comparison particularly with the United States. Again, this is partly due to a smaller population meaning a smaller funding market. But it is also fair to say that there is a general lack of appetite among institutional investors to invest in high-riskâ€”but high-rewardâ€”ventures such as medical advances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I had the pleasure of visiting the Institute of Molecular Bioscience at the University of Queensland in my electorate of Ryan. While I was there I met some very talented Australian researchers making truly awe-inspiring discoveries that could eventually be of life-changing benefit to people worldwide. There I was told that there can be no innovation without discovery of new knowledge. However, the trick is to get the balance right between generating knowledge and generating innovative outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, at present we do not appear to have the balance right. At the institute, promising research into new treatments for chronic pain, stroke, inflammation, cancer, obesity, diabetes, asthma, Parkinson's, liver fibrosis and many other diseases and illnesses is at risk of never getting out of the laboratory due to a lack of funding sources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear is that there is a funding gap between laboratory research and the market. In Australia this gap means that we are losing some of our best and brightest researchers, along with their intellectual property and lifesaving advances, to other countries. Australia is missing out on new home-grown, job-creating, knowledge-based industries. And in some cases, the world is missing out on what would otherwise be the next great medical advances because researchers simply give up on some projects altogether due to a lack of funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, there may be good news ahead. Just last month, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Business Review Weekly</span> magazine reported that Brandon Capital Partners has raised the largest ever venture capital commitment in Australian's history. A total of $200 million has been raised from four Australian pension funds to invest in a range of small life science companies. These companies are researching new treatments for everything from heart failure to golden staph and even a new vaccine for peanut allergy. The fund aims to find the new cochlear ear, CSL or ResMedâ€”and here's hoping they do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More investment is one thing, but we also need to get better at removing other barriers to translational medical research. Part of this process is engineering a cultural shift within the research field itself. Chief Scientist, Ian Chubb, is on record, lamenting the breakdown in linkages between basic research and clinical research. He says that while in the past medical research was conducted by physician-scientists who also treated patients, these days the majority of biomedical research is done by highly-specialised PhD scientists who have never seen a patient.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a sense we are becoming victims of our own success. The explosion in medical knowledge in recent decades has naturally led to increasing complexity and therefore increasing specialisation among researchers. The challenge now is encourage collaboration among researchers, to allow them to think beyond their narrow fields of research. Modern medical challenges are complex and span multiple fields of research. They require researchers to share research and to work together in an industry in which there is a financial incentive to protect intellectual property.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a market in which financial incentives are working against the common interest in bringing research into production, there is a role for government to break down the silos and create an environment in which translational medical research can flourish. But the industry isâ€”to borrow a phraseâ€”looking for a 'hand up' and not a 'hand out'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Health and Medical Research Council is increasingly moving beyond its traditional support for pure research and is now also focusing on translational research. A research translation faculty has been established to assist the council to address the key challenges of translation in the Australian market. Funding is also available for partnership projects to encourage collaboration between decision makers, policy makers, managers, clinicians and researchers. The $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund will also eventually have a transformational effect on Australian medical research and has the potential to assist in improving the translation of research from benchtop to patient.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a state level translational research is also becoming an increased focus. In Queensland the Translational Research Institute opened in 2012 on the Princess Alexandra Hospital campus in Brisbane. It is the largest medical research institute in the Southern Hemisphere. It houses four institutes and is funded by the state and federal governments, philanthropic contribution and universities, including the University of Queensland. It is a great example of collaborationâ€”indeed, one that sets the standard for others to follow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some great work is also being done in New South Wales, with the release last year of a dedicated health and medical research hub strategy that charts a new course of promoting collaboration and research translation. The state funded Cancer Institute of New South Wales also has a grant funding scheme dedicated to translational research, with more than $14 million provided to cancer researchers in 2014. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a nation that prides itself on the quality of our researchers and our pure research we can do a lot better in supporting our researchers to bring their ideas to market. While governments of all persuasions at state and federal level have begun to recognise this shortfall and are taking steps to remedy it, the nature of the industry means that achieving results will require sustained commitment from government over many years. Supporting translational medical research will be an ongoing challenge; however, as elected representatives we owe it to our researchers, such as Professor Brandon Wainwright's team at the IMB at the University of Queensland, and indeed to the people of Australia to see this challenge through.</span>
