                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen today is the total and complete capitulation by Malcolm Turnbull to the hard right of his party and to his big coal donors—a total, complete and utter capitulation by a cowardly and spineless Prime Minister, who doesn't have the ticker to stand up to the pro-coal lobbying side of his own party and stand up to the likes of the Nationals, who are more interested in doing the bidding of Gina Rinehart and the mining lobby than they are in standing up for their rural constituents. We've got the Nationals over there who are basically in this place doing a three-year long job interview so they can nick off and do the bidding of the coal and gas industry. Let's see who is part of the coal and gas industry in this country? It's a who's who of the National Party and the Liberal Party: Mark Vaile, John Anderson and Ian Macfarlane. Of course, Labor's not immune. They've got Martin Ferguson on the other side.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know what today is, Mr President? It is payday for those fossil fuel companies who have given millions of dollars in donations to all sides of politics for one reason: to get an energy policy in this country that serves no-one other than the big fossil fuel companies. This plan that the government has announced today will result in the death of the Great Barrier Reef. It will kill the Murray-Darling Basin. It will kill the jobs that rely on them. It will drive up pollution and it will drive up power prices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence is very clear. The energy regulator made it abundantly clear what would happen if the government had the courage to take on those big network companies: we would actually make some progress in bringing down power prices. The experts have made that abundantly clear. Yesterday, the ACCC said that power prices are so high because of market concentration. What we have got is a handful of energy generators who are milking Australian consumers dry and we have a government who says: 'We want you to have more of it. We want you to keep shafting consumers in the way that we've just shafted the Chief Scientist Alan Finkel.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine what Alan Finkel would be thinking right now? There he was bending over backwards to write a plan, with riding instructions from this government so that all he could come up with was a plan so narrow that it would have meant more coal in the system by 2050 than business as usual—but at least there was some incentive for clean energy. But Malcolm Turnbull has turned around to the Chief Scientist and said, 'Well, stuff you. We don't want a bar of what you are presenting us. We don't believe in science. We don't believe in what is absolutely crystal clear and what the business community is telling us and what the general community wants. What we want to do is keep propping up the business model for our coal and gas mates'. That's what this plan is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a plan written by the coal and gas industry that shafts the people that the Nationals over here say they stand for—people living in regional areas, farmers, regional communities. So, instead, what do the Nationals want to do? They want to open up more farmland for coal seam gas. They want to see more of their constituents having to fight those big gas companies who want to frack land, contaminate their water and, ultimately, turn Australian farmland into an industrial-scale wasteland. Why do they do it? It's because they're in the pocket of the coal and gas industry., and they get those big cheques coming in.

                  </a>  That's why we see the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, flying around the countryside with the likes of Gina Rinehart—because he's more interested in doing the bidding of the mining and gas industry than he is in looking after farmers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bottom line is that we have thousands of jobs that are being sacrificed right now because of this government's commitment to the coal and gas industry. We're losing that great innovation here—it's going overseas—because we're locking ourselves into the sinking ship of fossil fuels. That's what it is. And it's a huge tragedy, because this could be a good news opportunity for Australia. We could be talking about bringing in jobs and investment and making sure that we've got a pathway for those people in regional communities. Instead, this government has locked us in into rising power prices, job losses and skyrocketing emissions. This is a disgrace, and the Prime Minister should hang his head in shame.</span>

Well, Senator Di Natale, I'll tell you what working Australians want. They want affordable energy electricity prices and they want reliable supply. That's what they want. And there is only one political party represented in this parliament that will give it to them—and that is the government parties of the Liberal Party and the National Party.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Di Natale, you spoke about an announcement. There has been no announcement.  So your entire speech is based on press speculation that you have, no doubt, tried to trick up into a speech. However, I can tell you, Senator Di Natale, having come from the government party room a short while ago where this matter was discussed, that I am expecting the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment and Energy, Mr Frydenberg, to be making some announcements in the coming hour or so. When those announcements are made, contrary, Senator Di Natale, to what you have just so foolishly asserted, you will learn that the announcements the government is making—which, out of courtesy to the Prime Minister, I will not be anticipating in these remarks—are informed by science, are informed by engineering and, more particularly, are informed by the most experienced experts in the field. But, as I say, out of courtesy to the Prime Minister and Mr Frydenberg, I won't be anticipating in this speech anything that they may shortly be about to say. What I can also tell you, Senator Di Natale, is that when the announcement is made—</span>

                  </a>  I have a point of order, and it relates to addressing senators by their correct name. I have heard Senator Brandis consistently refer to me as Senator 'Di Na-ta-lay'. I know Senator Brandis prides himself on his diction, but my name is 'Di Na-ta-li', not 'Di Na-ta-lay'. So if he would like to refer to me by my proper name I would be most appreciative.</span>

                  </a>  I have. And I mean no offence, Senator Di Natale, but that is just the way I pronounce the English language. I am sorry if my pronunciation is imperfect. In any event, Senator Di Natale, I can assure you that when the announcement is made you will discover that what has fallen from your lips in the last few minutes is completely wrong. And you will be ashamed, Senator Di Natale, when you learn on whose advice and guidance the policy measures about to be announced have been based.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Di Natale, if I may address you and the Greens, we know the political game you have been playing—and if I may say so you've been playing it pretty well. You have got the Australian Labor Party on the run, because you are in a competition with them for the inner-city green hipster vote, and you are winning. You are taking the Labor Party to more and more extreme positions every day. It probably does the Greens a lot of good, but it is devastating for the Australian Labor Party. Unfortunately, it is also a recipe for bad policy. The ultimate victims of your political strategy, driven by ideology—and, as the Prime Minister unkindly said the other day, driven by idiocy—are the Australian people themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be announcing a suite of measures the effect of which will be to reduce electricity prices and guarantee reliability of supply. I know, Senator Di Natale, you have a problem with that, but the Australian people don't have a problem with that, because that is what they want. They want their electricity prices reduced and the reliability of their supply guaranteed, and that is precisely what the effect of the measures the Prime Minister is shortly to announce will be. They are informed by science, informed by engineering and informed by economics, but avoiding like the plague the ideology that drives you. We are not interested in Green ideology, Senator Di Natale; we are interested in outcomes. That is what the Australian people are interested in too. So when the next election comes around in about 18 months or so, there will be a stark choice: the Green-Labor Party alliance, with higher electricity prices and insecure supply, or the government's policies, with lower prices and secure supply. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="ING" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLAGHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  After those very unkind remarks by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, I feel like changing Labor's position on this suspension. However, I think for good reasons the Labor Party will not be supporting the suspension of standing orders today. I point out that it seems like at the beginning of every Tuesday of every sitting week we have a suspension motion by the Greens party on the issue of the day, to chew up time without much notice—probably 10 minutes notice to other parties that they are moving a suspension.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From Labor's point of view, it is premature to have a debate on a motion that condemns the government's latest energy announcement when that announcement hasn't actually been made. Don't get me wrong—we can debate for hours the failure of the Turnbull government on energy policy, and we would look forward to debating that. We would look forward to debating the dumping of the work of the Chief Scientist at the behest of the former Prime Minister. For four years this government has trashed energy policy and turned itself inside out, fighting amongst themselves on climate change and energy policy. It hasn't been able to govern in the national interest, putting the interests of Australians first. I think it is fair to say we will all suffer from that, not just those of us in this place but generations to come. Looking at the different positions the government has had on energy policy, I remember the time when the Prime Minister supported a price on carbon, an EIS and a CET, and now all of a sudden he is walking away from all of that because the former Prime Minister and his supporters in the coalition party room not only hold the government to ransom; they hold the whole country to ransom and they are still stuck in a vortex where they're discussing whether the science of climate change is actually settled yet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will need to see the detail of the next iteration of the government's energy policy prior to debating it in this place. As I said, the Prime Minister has had a number of positions. We don't hold much faith that this new policy will last any longer than those that have come before it. We want to see a responsible energy policy put in place. We want to reach agreement. We have offered to talk with the government on the clean energy target through our own preferred mechanism, through an EIS. We did that very early after the Finkel report came out. That was us prepared to compromise, but, unfortunately, the government have refused to talk with us because they haven't actually settled the issue between themselves. We want to see households given relief from the rising cost of bills. We want certainty in the policy so that the investment strike ends and, importantly, so that Australians can get their fair share of the jobs that are being developed in the rapidly expanding global renewable energy industry. All of that is for debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the Greens have all of Thursday morning as time for private senators' bills and business. We could spend the whole morning debating the policy once the actual policy has been released and we have the detail of that policy. We are not at all scared about debating the policy. We welcome debate on the policy. There are a range of mechanisms within the Senate through which we can pursue that this week—MPIs, urgency motions, questions, senators' statements, the adjournment debate and, indeed, all of the time on Thursday morning. There is more than enough time. However, our job here is also to progress legislation on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>, whether we agree or disagree with that legislation. That is the job we have been asked to perform by the Australian people. This wastes that time. It wastes time for debate on other important bills. It is premature in terms of being able to debate seriously and honestly the policy that this government may or may not have finally resolved for themselves—for the time being, until it is nobbled by Tony Abbott again. But the form being used and the mechanism being used by the Greens to suspend the program today to have this debate, prior to a package being released, is not appropriate, and we won't be supporting it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FIFIELD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  I agree with the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate that this is becoming a pattern for the leader of the Greens—at kick-off on a Tuesday afternoon to seek leave to move a motion and, when it is denied, to then follow through with a suspension of standing orders, the outcome of which I think we can all predict. This has become a pattern which has disrupted the working of this place, disrupted government business time. There are many forms in this place to address issues that colleagues wish to put a focus on. Obviously there is question time. There is matters of public importance. There is matters of public interest. There is general business time. There are a range of forms in this place for colleagues to avail themselves of. That's the first point—that this is not the time, this is not the opportunity, to seek to ventilate these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I wish to make is that the leader of the Greens is seeking to debate matters which are yet to be put into the public domain. It is a matter of record that the government have agreed to 49 of the 50 Finkel recommendations and that we are going through our internal processes to look at other matters that Mr Finkel touched upon. And, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate alluded to, it is highly likely that we will have more to say in the coming hours. This would be an odd time to have a debate, when the chamber is not in possession of what the government has to say later today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think it's worth just pausing for a moment to reflect on what the government has done on the issue of energy. We're absolutely seized of the importance of reliability, the importance of affordability and the importance of meeting our international commitments. Since we've been in government, we have abolished the carbon tax, which is the single most significant thing to address affordability, and I don't hear calls from the community for that to be reintroduced. We have, obviously, made our commitments in Paris, which we intend to honour. We have put in serious work with the energy retailers. As a result, consumers have been written to advising them that there are better deals available and that they should take advantage of those, and many Australians have done just that. We have also taken steps in relation to the domestic gas supply to ensure that that is met and that there is downward pressure there. We instituted the Finkle review, and, as I mentioned, we've adopted 49 of the 50 recommendations. The Finkle review recommendations went to COAG. They then went to the energy ministers, and the energy ministers collectively adopted 49 of the 50. We now have an internal process underway which we'll have more to say about shortly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber, we don't take a theological or an ideological approach to energy policy. We look at the engineering. We look at the economics. We already have a plan which is before the Australian people, and we'll have a little bit more to say very soon about the next iteration of that. The Greens have not made a compelling case for the suspension of standing orders this morning. There are forms in this place to address issues, and we will all have the benefit of what the government has to say a little later today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  We have heard clearly from the former Prime Minister himself, Tony Abbott, on progress at today's party room: the clean energy target has definitely been 'dropped'. You can see who's in charge here. Tony Abbott, former Prime Minister, is back running the show over there on the other side. And, of course, what have we had announced? The National Energy Guarantee, the NEG. I'll tell you who's been negged and who's negging. It's Tony Abbott, former Prime Minister, negging Malcolm Turnbull. Do you know what a neg is? It's a trick. It's designed to undermine somebody's confidence. This is exactly what is going on inside the coalition party room right now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former Prime Minister spent 10 years trying to destroy climate policy in this nation. Ten years on, he delivers another wrecking ball right through the renewable energy industry and right through households who have done the right thing by putting solar on their roof and embracing clean energy to bring down their power bills. This is an attack on Australians right across the country. Malcolm Turnbull has capitulated. He's been negged by Tony Abbott, and it's going to be Australians, householders and businesses that suffer. This is a terrible day for climate change, for the planet and for householders who want lower bills. Nothing announced today is going to reduce people's power prices. That is the only guarantee we've got.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you what a stunt is. A stunt is the Prime Minister's weak attempt to pretend to this country that he is doing something about climate change and that he is doing something about power prices. He isn't. He's just pulling a stunt to try to appease Mr Abbott, who thinks climate change is good for this planet and who is a laughing stock around the world. Mr Abbott is the guy who wants to throw goats in the volcano. He's not the one who is trying to undermine how the globe responds to climate change. Mr Turnbull is fully owned by Mr Abbott and big business, who want nothing but to make a few short-term profits at the risk of future generations. That's what this debate is about.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All the coalition can say in response to this motion is, 'This is a stunt,' because they don't want to own up that they have completely capitulated and they don't want to own the fact that we will never meet our Paris targets now. We will not. They have handed climate change policy totally to Mr Abbott. The flat-earthers of this country should hang their heads in shame rather than come in here and try to justify their appalling policy. They are setting us back decades and are condemning this planet.</span>

Tackling climate change is the most significant thing we need to be doing in the world today, and it is absolutely critical that this parliament realises the urgency and the importance of dealing with climate change. The announcement that is being made today is setting us so far back in that it's propping up support for coal, gas and oil and destroying our country's ability to move forward to an energy supply that is clean and green.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel like I am living in an alternative universe. I studied climate science 37 years ago; it was 1980 when I first learned about the then newly emerging science of global warming. In those 37 years, that science has become clearer, more stark and absolutely more disturbing in terms of the impact climate change will have on the planet and on the peoples of this planet. We know that we can move forward. There is an absolutely positive future for Australia as part of the global community dealing with the challenges of global warming. It is a future in which we won't be looking down the barrel of increasing heatwaves that are going to kill thousands of Australians over the coming decades and we won't be looking down the barrel of more extensive fires. It won't be a future in which we're unable to grow food in our community. Today's announcement trashes that positive future that we could be looking forward to.</span>

Senator Gallagher outlined our general objection to this repetitive procedural technique to drag the Senate off the order of business that has been established and the discourtesy that that approach represents. But on the substance of the matter the Greens bring forward today I will make this observation: we would not need to be having this debate today if you had brought yourself to vote for the CPRS when it was brought into this chamber so many years ago. There have been many opportunities in the last decade for you to support a serious emissions trading scheme proposed by a Labor government committed to tackling climate change, but you squibbed it. You squibbed it for a range of reasons, but my deepest suspicion is that you did so because it was electorally convenient for you to maintain a point of differentiation with Labor. And, if that meant throwing away the one opportunity that you had to establish a coherent, global approach to tackling emissions reduction in the country, that was a sacrifice you were willing to make. It was a sacrifice you were willing to make for absolutely base political reasons, and you ought to be reminded of it every time this chamber comes back to climate change.</span>

I am horrified at the debate this nation has gone through over the last 12 months and I am genuinely surprised to see a coalition government unable to commit to even basic principles of policy design around the National Electricity Market. It has been hopeless; it has been embarrassing. But I will say this: the Greens have not helped. You have spent a decade trying to politicise this for your own purposes, and that has been at the expense of serious policy debate in this country.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RUSTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  In summing up in relation to the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017, can I just put on the record that this bill delivers on an election commitment by the government to establish a regional investment corporation. We're establishing this corporation because we know that a high-performing agricultural sector is good for farmers, good for regional communities and good for national prosperity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation, we want to make sure that we have strong and resilient farms and farm businesses that can seize the opportunities that are before us. In such a competitive and challenging environment, we need to make sure that we give the tools to those farm businesses that they need to take advantage of these opportunities. We also need the right water infrastructure in place for agriculture to expand and increase its productivity. Establishing the corporation will support both of these goals. The corporation will deliver the Commonwealth's farm business loans program nationally and this will be a significant step forward. Because we believe that we need to be more responsive in providing these loans to meet the needs of farm businesses, loans decisions will also be made consistently across the country under this new instrument. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The farm business loans program offered by the corporation will be improved and expanded. Its loans will help farm businesses take advantage of opportunities to diversify in the markets they supply and the loans will boost farm productivity and cash flow, and provide positive economic and social flow-on effects to the entire Australian community. The corporation will not be a lender of last resort. The focus will be on giving a hand-up to those farmers who are viable but in need of temporary short-term assistance. The corporation will administer the National Water Loan Facility, providing independent, expert advice to government on water infrastructure projects; it will then administer loans on behalf of the Commonwealth with the right expertise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provisions of the bill were examined in an inquiry by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. The committee recommended that the bill be passed and considered that its enactment would streamline the delivery of concessional loans for farm businesses and for water infrastructure. Obviously, the government welcomes that finding. Despite the committee's overall recommendation, I note that Labor senators provided a dissenting report, which raised a number of issues with the bill and the proposed establishment of the corporation. The policy rationale for establishing the corporation is quite clear. As for the governance and the oversight arrangements, they are appropriate for a corporate Commonwealth entity and align with what the parliament has agreed for similar entities, such as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. I note that in addition to the requirements in the bill, the corporation will be subject to the requirements of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013, which forms an important part of the overall governance structure. In addition, the corporation will be subject to the usual Senate scrutiny process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, establishing the corporation will make a significant contribution to stronger and more prosperous rural and regional communities across the whole of the country. Its loans will help farm businesses build and maintain diversity in the markets they supply. It will also help support the construction of priority water infrastructure to stimulate investment, economic growth and increase agricultural productivity in rural and regional Australia. Establishing the corporation demonstrates this government's commitment to the Australian farm sector. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  I rise in the committee stage to make a few comments on the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017 and to perhaps make a broader point about the management of the government's business program. If we use this bill as an example, we have seen over the last two days this bill move up the program and down the program a bit yesterday, and then start listed in third place for bills today and be moved up to first position at the last minute before the program was printed. We saw the ridiculous position of bringing a bill on for debate and then having government members filibustering on that bill for at least four hours on a Monday, which is the day, one would presume, the government would like to progress through their legislative program promptly—that is, if they actually wanted bills passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point I'd like to make is that I think it's disrespectful to the crossbench managing the program this way—putting bills on and off, moving them up the program, making these changes, filibustering and bringing it back on for debate this morning. We hear that there are government amendments that may be moved. We haven't seen any of those. We don't know if there are actually any government amendments; we hear rumours circulating that there are, but we haven't seen them. The expectation by the government is, presumably, that we should just be able to process these amendments, form positions on them, debate them, ask questions on them and deal with them without any notice at all. I guess, in general, the government cannot manage its program, and that has been exemplified by the management of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If, come Wednesday night or Thursday, there are a whole range of bills that the government do want progressed, I would draw their attention to the fact that they have used up the majority of their government business time on Monday actually filibustering their own bill. The opposition will not be disposed positively towards any extension or any motion by the government seeking to extend hours to deal with bills because they have failed miserably to manage this bill in an orderly way that respects other people in this chamber. For the crossbench and for the opposition, it means we have to ensure that people are ready with speeches at a time when the bill might be on, even though it might not be on, it might be pulled halfway or it might come back on without notice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we get the fact that the government needs to change its program from time to time. We are sympathetic to the reality of running a program, but this is becoming standard practice. It's not something that happens rarely, happens only in exceptional circumstances or happens when there are legitimate reasons; it is happening every business day and it is happening every sitting week. I see that the government amendments now have been circulated, but we're at the point in time when senators are expected to debate these amendments and, presumably, vote on them without any opportunity to discuss them more thoroughly and form a position on them. So, that's the point I'd make.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that the manager of government business is listening because I am making this point not just on this bill but on the management of the government program as a whole. I think you can just look at the amount of time that the Senate is having to sit extended hours to deal with the mismanagement of the government and how it approaches its discussions around getting legislation through this Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  I support the comments made by Senator Gallagher. What we've seen in the last couple of days is nothing short of a complete shambles and a complete disrespect for this chamber. We have just received the government's amendments. I haven't had a chance to go through these amendment or the implications of the amendments proposed by the government. But I would like to say that I was very disappointed in the fact that we've come to the in committee stage and that a vote to oppose this bill outright defeated. I would also like to put the party's position on record. We do believe that the bill should have been chucked out. We believe that this is, again, the Deputy Prime Minister's pork barrel for a political advantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017 has been developed with no cost-benefit analysis as to whether the corporation will actually deliver any of the claims put forward by the government. There has been no transparent or fair process undertaken by the government to determine where the location of the RIC will be. In fact, a government senator, in their contribution, also questioned the location of the RIC. As I've said, the RIC is just another effort by Mr Joyce to serve a political purpose only.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another point that the Labor Party made in our contribution to this bill was about the cost of establishing the RIC. We believe that the true cost is $81 million over the forwards, with the potential to be higher if there's a low intake of loans. The existing current loans that are administered by states and the Northern Territory will remain the responsibility of the states and the Territory. Establishing a new body to administer new loans is a waste of taxpayers' money, is inefficient and is costly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a Senate inquiry into this bill. I would like to take a few moments to go through what the dissenting report from Labor senators reported. It was noted in that report that the government:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">• Has failed to provide any coherent policy rationale for the establishment of the Regional Investment Corporation (RIC);</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">• Has offered mixed messages when enunciating the policy objectives for the establishment of the RIC;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, as I've said, and as the Senate dissenting report on this bill also noted, the government:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">• Has failed to undertake a cost-benefit analysis to give confidence that the $28m cost of establishing and operating the RIC delivers good value for the Australian taxpayer;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is not unusual when something comes from Mr Barnaby Joyce that there's a failure to undertake a cost-benefit analysis. Given that there hasn't been a cost-benefit analysis, it doesn't give confidence that the $28 million cost—the government's own figure, I might add—of establishing and operating the RIC delivers good value for the Australian taxpayer. I will return to the dissenting report on this bill later in the committee stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party have proposed and circulated a number of amendments, and we will be requesting that those amendments be moved separately. We are hoping that the minister at the table will seek to explain the intention of the government amendments that have just been put before us.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RUSTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  Firstly, in response to the comments of Senator Brown in relation to the costs, there were some wildly exaggerated figures thrown around in the House of Representatives when this particular bill, the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017, was debated. There was some sort of bizarre suggestion that this was going to cost taxpayers $81.4 million over the forwards. That is manifestly false. The government provided $28.5 million in the budget of May 2017 for the current program to establish the RIC over the next four years. Those funds will be offset against charges and are expected to be cost neutral over the life of the project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the policy intent of the organisation that we're seeking to establish under the bill, as I said in my summing up notes following the finalisation of the second reading speech, it is for a number of purposes, not least of which is to get a more responsive and streamlined approach to get money to our farmers as quickly as possible when they're most in need. Creating a purpose designed organisation to enable us to be very quick and responsive in times of need for our farmers is a very sound and valid policy reason for the establishment of this particular corporation. It's about giving farmers the quickest and easiest opportunity to respond to unforeseen circumstances and, most importantly, take advantage of market opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In offering to administer the national water infrastructure loans and grants program through this organisation, we provide a far greater level of transparency than is currently necessary. So it seems somewhat bizarre that those opposite would not accept the offer extended by the government in good faith to provide a greater level of transparency and accountability in relation to the administration of a considerable amount of taxpayers' funds for the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brown, in her opening remarks, asked me to explain the reasoning behind the small amendments that we have tabled for consideration today. Explicitly included in this bill is a statement to make it absolutely clear that the responsible ministers under this instrumentality, should it become enacted, must exercise their powers consistently with the Water Act. That was implicit in the existing bill, but we put it forward to make sure that it is explicitly stated in this bill that the ministers must act consistently with the Water Act. We are proposing to put forward an added level of transparency. We have charged the Murray-Darling Basin Authority with the responsibility of ensuring that any actions that are taken by the RIC meet the requirements of the Water Act, and we would have a second body that would validate that the Water Act has been complied with, and that validation would be made public. That is the intent of the amendments that have been tabled by the government in relation to this bill, Senator Brown.</span>

The Water Act obviously covers more than the Murray-Darling Basin, so it is in essence a broad-reaching requirement that the RIC must be compliant with the Water Act in relation to all federal water policy.</span>

To be clear, the review is currently being undertaken by the states. The states will then report to the ministers by the end of 2017 to enable any changes and actions to have taken place by the time the intergovernmental agreement expires in June 2018. I am sorry for perhaps misleading you in my first answer.</span>

The agreement aims to: assist farm families and primary producers adapt to and prepare for the impacts of increased climate variability; encourage farm families and primary producers to adopt self-reliant approaches to manage their business risks; ensure farm families in hardship have access to a household support payment that recognises the special positions of farms; ensure social support services are accessible to farm families; and provide a framework for a jurisdiction's response to needs during periods of drought. My question to the minster is: can the government provide detail to the chamber as to how the farm concessional loans will be administered and will any of those functions be outsourced?</span>

At the moment, the administration of this particular suite of loans package is being administered under the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. Obviously we are seeking to have the Regional Investment Corporation undertake the administration of these loans in the future, so I am not quite sure what the question is you are asking. The terms and conditions, the requirements and the objectives we are seeking to achieve by this particular suite of loans package remains the same. We are just seeking for it to be administered by the corporation because we believe it will be delivered in a more streamlined and effective way.</span>

There have been, to my knowledge, no discussions specifically about outsourcing particular aspects of these loan instruments. Is there anything that you have specifically got an issue about? To the best of my knowledge, I can't think of anything that has been discussed to date.</span>

It is not transparent in the bill as to the actual need for, in my view, the Regional Investment Corporation.

Well, there are a number of things and factors here that have gone towards why the government believes that the Regional Investment Corporation is the appropriate mechanism by which to deliver loans into the rural and regional farm community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, it is to come up with a nationally consistent approach to the delivery of these loans. Very often, when we find that we have a particular situation, it affects a number of states and territories. To have a consistent approach so that we don't have one farmer on one side of the fence and a farmer on the other side of the fence actually being treated differently is certainly seen to be a great advantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, because the corporation is going to be designed with the specific purpose of delivering this type of instrument then, obviously, the charter of the organisation, the mandate of the organisation and the authorities of the organisation will be particularly targeting the efficient and effective delivery of the activities that it is empowered to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, obviously, lastly: as I mentioned to you earlier, an independently-established standalone organisation, like the proposal for the Regional Investment Corporation, delivers a level of transparency. Throughout the whole process of determination of the loan assets and the delivery of the programs transparency will be much greater under this particular organisation than is currently the case.</span>

That has really homed in on one of the great concerns the opposition has with this legislation. It goes to the transparency and the governance in the bill. This is notwithstanding the two government amendments that you have just put forward—no doubt to garner the support of some on the crossbench. Otherwise, we wouldn't see these two amendments that enable some sort of transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what the dissenting report said about the bill: the Labor senators believe that the enabling legislation has been structured deliberately to minimise parliamentary scrutiny and/or veto of ministerial directions. The report also indicated that the bill has failed to provide sufficient oversight for the activities of the corporation. Now, I do note, as I said, the two amendments. But they don't go anywhere near allaying concerns that this legislation addresses the lack of governance arrangements and the lack of transparency. And, of course, as we have said before, we believe there has been a lack of proper consultation on this bill, and nothing that you have said to me here this afternoon has allayed those fears. So if you can add to the consultation and address my concerns about lack of transparency and the lack of good governance arrangements, I'd appreciate that.</span>

I draw to the chamber's attention that the corporation will be accountable to the parliament through a series of measures that have been outlined in the bill, such as the requirement to table the operating mandate, requirements of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act—the PGPA Act—and it is also subject to the same Senate scrutiny processes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's probably also worth mentioning that the approach proposed to be taken in this bill and that is written into this bill is very similar to other entities, including the Clean Energy Finance Corporation that was set up under previous arrangements. In a sense, what we have attempted to do in the drafting of this particular bill is to make sure it is consistent and replicates the kinds of requirements in relation to public governance and accountability, reporting and scrutiny, that have been applied to other similar types of organisations and government instruments. </span>

It's certainly no surprise to the opposition that that is the case with anything that comes from the Deputy Prime Minister. It's like some sort of protection racket when it comes to legislation that he puts forward. There always appears to be a lack of detailed scrutiny and a lack of work carried out in terms of the initiatives that Mr Joyce puts forward. So it is no surprise that we again see the lack of parliamentary scrutiny with regard to this bill and, certainly, the lack of transparency. The minister hasn't allayed those concerns for the opposition in her answer at all. What I would like to ask the minister is: what work has the government done to establish the RIC in Orange? </span>

Firstly, I don't think for a minute that you are suggesting that the government, of which you were a member when you established the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, were running a protection racket when you put in the provisions in terms of the public governance, accountability and reporting of that particular organisation. On the basis that this particular bill is proposing to establish this organisation in an almost mirror image of how that organisation was established along its governance, accountability and reporting requirements, I'm not quite sure why you would suggest that we are running, as you put it, 'a protection racket'. I'd be interested to hear from you the difference between your establishment of something not being a protection racket, but you seem to think you can throw that at us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the specifics of the requirements in relation to governance, accountability and reporting, as I said, the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 requires this particular organisation to be subject to the provisions of that particular act, as is every other entity of a similar type. You'll also note that, because of the way it's been established, this organisation will be subject to the same sort of Senate scrutiny as others through the estimates process, in which you, obviously, actively take part.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is, we believe, an appropriate level of parliamentary oversight over the directions of the responsible ministers through exactly the same method and means and in exactly the same way as you have accepted over many years with the reporting of other organisations. This will be no different. The level of oversight, reporting, accountability and transparency will be absolutely no different to other organisations of similar establishment. So I'm struggling to work out what particular aspect of the proposed establishment of this organisation you see as different to the mechanisms and requirements of the establishment of other organisations—as I said, particularly the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, set up under your government.</span>

It was remiss of me—I failed to respond to the final part of your previous question. The Australian government, as this chamber would be well aware, has a very strong commitment to rural and regional Australia, and the decision made by the government to locate the Regional Investment Corporation outside our capital cities is clearly consistent with that policy. I don't know whether you've spent much time in Orange, but Orange is a really important agricultural hub in this country. It's well serviced by transport links to the major capital cities, particularly Sydney. We are seeing an extraordinary increase in growth in this community and the relocation of a number of New South Wales government departments to Orange, creating a very strong rural and regional agricultural hub in that community. The decision to locate this organisation in Orange is extraordinarily consistent with the government policy to establish strong regional centres across the whole of Australia.</span>

But, for the reasons that I stated in my previous answer, the decision was made that Orange was a very suitable place for this organisation to be located. Obviously, should we be successful in enacting the establishment of this organisation, it will be up to the board to undertake the preparatory work about the location of the agency in Orange.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:59</span>):  My question is to Senator Brandis, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Can the minister confirm that on various occasions Prime Minister Turnbull has supported each of the following propositions: an emissions trading scheme, a carbon tax, an emissions intensity scheme, a clean energy target and, last but not least, a stronger renewable energy target? Did Mr Turnbull believe in each of these positions as much as he does in today's? </span>

But what I can confirm is that about half an hour ago the Prime Minister and the minister for energy, Mr Frydenberg, announced the Australian government's energy policy, the National Energy Guarantee. This is a game-changing policy. It is implicit in your question, Senator Kitching, that there has been unsettlement and uncertainty in Australian energy policy for a good decade or more. But now, as a result of the announcement that the Turnbull government has made in the last half hour, there no longer is. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The choice could not be more stark than it is. The Australian government has adopted the recommendations of the Energy Security Board—a board of specialists who are better informed about the operation of the Australian energy market than any other group of people in Australia—to adopt a suite of policies which collectively are known as the National Energy Guarantee. As a result of this announcement, the uncertainty that has bedevilled this area of public policy for a decade or more now is a thing of the past. As a result of this policy, we will begin to see electricity prices go down. We will guarantee the reliability of supply, something that the Australian Labor Party, particularly in South Australia, has been unable to do. In the meantime we will stick to our Paris targets as well. This is a win-win-win. </span>

The proposition you've asserted is completely wrong. What the government has adopted is a series of recommendations of the Energy Security Board: Kerry Schott, the chair of that board; Clare Savage, the deputy chair; John Pierce, the Chair of the Australian Energy Market Commission; Audrey Zibelman, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Energy Market Operator; and Paula Conboy, Chair of the Australian Energy Regulator. Senator Kitching, you would know of some of these men and women. They are the best-informed specialists, the people in Australia with the most intimate knowledge of the Australian energy market, whose appointment, not by this government but by COAG three months ago, was welcomed by your own shadow spokesman, Mr Butler, as excellent. </span>

As I said to Senator Kitching, based on the advice of the Energy Security Board, it is expected that the National Energy Guarantee will lead to a reduction in the typical household bill of between $110 and $115 per year over the 2020-2030 period. The guarantee is made up of two parts that will require energy retailers across the National Electricity Market to deliver reliable and lower emissions generations each year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A reliability guarantee will be set to deliver the right level of dispatchable energy from ready-to-use sources such as coal, gas, pumped hydro and batteries needed in each state. It will be set by the Australian Energy Market Commission and the Australian Energy Market Operator. An emissions guarantee will be set to contribute to Australia's international commitments. The level of the guarantee will be determined by the Commonwealth and enforced by the Australian Energy Regulator. The National Energy Guarantee will lower electricity prices, make the system more reliable, encourage investment and reduce emissions without subsidies, taxes or trading schemes. The age of subsidies is over.</span>

It's obvious to all of us why it is important that Australia have a reliable, secure and affordable energy supply. It is a fundamental obligation of any government to keep the lights on and to provide its people with power at prices they can afford. And, as a result of the announcements made today by the Prime Minister, that is precisely what we mean to do.</span>

That's the difference: the Labor Party, driven by ideology, can't even keep the lights on and the Turnbull government has a plan for affordable and reliable supply.</span>

                  </a>  through you, Mr President—in fact, what we saw with the election of the coalition government in 2013 was the sharpest reduction of electricity prices on record, as a direct result of the repeal of the carbon tax. Do you remember the carbon tax, Senator Dastyari? It was the tax that Ms Julia Gillard promised never to introduce, then—on the footing of a false promise made at the 2010 election—did introduce, that caused power prices to undergo their sharpest increase on record, so that, over the six-year period of the Labor government, power prices—the cost to households of electricity—doubled. It was an increase of 101 per cent, in fact, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Since the election of the coalition government, the power price has stabilised. First it fell—it fell by the sharpest decline in electricity costs in 2014 when we repealed the carbon tax—and then it crept up a little. But, over the four years of the coalition government, the average price has stabilised. As a result of the measures announced today by the Prime Minister and by Mr Frydenberg, based on the advice of the Energy Security Board, we can now expect prices to fall by between $110 and $115 per annum, as a result of those measures alone. That is in addition to, I might say, Senator Dastyari, the other measures, like, for example, the abolition of limited merits review, which the ACCC also predicted would lead to downward pressure on electricity prices.</span>

It is the case that Dr Finkel recommended a clean energy target, and the government, as I've told you time beyond number in this chamber, Senator Dastyari, has spent several months now considering that recommendation. We've engaged all of the relevant specialists in the field, but, in particular, we've engaged and sought the advice of the people who actually operate the Australian energy market: the Australian Energy Market Operator and the Energy Security Board. On the basis of their advice, the government has adopted a better policy, a policy that will lead to greater reductions in the price of electricity to households—that is, the National Energy Guarantee. It is not our view; it is the view of the Energy Security Board.</span>

For goodness sake! We have, as I have assured you through many question times since the middle of the year, embarked on a careful, methodical consideration of the policy options and, as I said a moment ago, we have sought the advice of the people with the most direct specialist knowledge of the operation of the Australian energy market: the Energy Security Board, the Australian Energy Market Operator and the Australian Energy Market Commission. And it is their advice that we will actually achieve best results in terms of reducing the cost of electricity to households through the National Energy Guarantee, the policy announced by the Prime Minister in the last hour, than we would through a clean energy target. So, Senator Dastyari, that's the way the coalition makes policy: we consult the relevant experts and we make evidence based decisions upon their advice.</span>

When he lost the leadership he said:</span>

We admired your thespian ambitions yesterday, but I'm afraid they have hit the wall. In fact, every premise in your question is wrong—every single one. As a result of the recommendations of the Energy Security Board—that group of specialists with the most immediate and intimate knowledge of the operation of the energy market, whose advice this government has chosen to follow and to adopt—the share of renewable energy in the energy mix will increase by 2030 to the range of 28 to 36 per cent. It will increase, Senator Di Natale, and the share of carbon-based energy sources, coal and gas, will reduce. So, Senator Di Natale, that premise of your question is wrong.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And you questioned the Prime Minister's motives. This is what grown-up governments do: they listen to the advice of those best in position to advise them and they consider the options. They consider the options. Through the COAG process, we commissioned Dr Alan Finkel to prepare a report. He made 50 recommendations, 49 of which the government has accepted. One recommendation in relation to a clean energy target we did consider, but we adopted a different proposal from the Energy Security Board—a group of men and women with even more immediate knowledge of the operation of the Australian energy market than that of Dr Finkel—because their proposal, announced by the Prime Minister in the last hour, will result in even more reductions of price of electricity to Australian households than Dr Finkel's clean energy target.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, we have consulted the experts. We have considered the options. We have gone about this methodically and carefully and come up with the best choice for the Australian people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

No, I don't accept that for one moment. In fact, on any view of the Australian energy market, coal will be a very important component of the Australian energy mix for decades to come, and the presence of coal as an important continuing part of the Australian energy mix is one of the things that will make Australian electricity more affordable to Australian households when the government's National Energy Guarantee policy is put into operation.</span>

Every one of the three questions you've asked me has not been about the policy; it's been about cheap stunts from the team of undergraduates behind you or it's been about personal attacks on the character and motives of the Prime Minister. If you want to have an argument about policy, we're up for it, because we have adopted a sensible policy on the recommendation of the specialists who operate the Australian energy market. But you, Senator Di Natale, who pretend to be interested, can't rise above stunts.</span>

English is our national language. The livelihood and prosperity of all Australians depends on how proficient we are at the language. According to 2016 census data, there's a decline in the number of households proficient in English, with a four per cent reduction in the percentage of people speaking the language at home. The other 2016 NAPLAN data, which tested reading, writing, spelling and grammar, shows South Australian schools performed below the national average. What is the government doing to arrest this trend and increase English proficiency?</span>

The Turnbull government takes very seriously the challenge of improving literacy skills in English for all Australians but particularly for those who may come from backgrounds with a language other than English. Australia is, of course, a linguistically diverse country, with participation in so many aspects of our life—economically, socially and culturally as well—being reliant upon effective communication in standard Australian English.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To support in particular migrants who arrive in Australia and need to improve their English skills, the government is investing more than $1.2 billion over the next four years into the longstanding Australian Migrant English Program, which provides up to 510 hours of tuition to help support students. But, more importantly, we've also delivered reforms to that longstanding program that focus on proficiency in English skills, not just the time that's served. We've implemented the AMEP Extend program, a new capped subprogram that offers up to 490 additional hours of tuition to eligible clients to help further improve their language proficiency skills and get them up to the standard that's required. Further, just last week I announced changes to the ELICOS standards related to English-language training around Australia to better ensure that people learning English prior to entry into tertiary education programs—higher education or vocation education—attain the standard necessary to succeed and participate fully in those programs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We note the NAPLAN results, which are, indeed, why the government has been taking steps in relation to earlier intervention, including our proposal, which we have been working on with the states and territories, for a year 1 skills check to help have earlier diagnosis and therefore earlier support for children who need additional assistance in their language skills. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We collaborate in a number of ways, in particular through the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority, ACARA, to work to improve English-language skills. I'm pleased that in 2015 all ministers agreed to curriculum changes around Australia, which strengthened areas of the teaching around literacy, and also agreed to move NAPLAN online at the time, which is an important change because it will provide the capacity for faster and more accurate diagnostic reporting to teachers, making that a much more useful tool in the future for schools and individual teachers. We've also obtained support and agreement from the states and territories for a range of teacher training reforms which will ensure minimum literacy standards for future teaching graduates, as well as primary school teachers undertaking specialisations. We expect we will see more specialist English and literacy teachers entering primary schools into the future.</span>

My department is tasked with focusing on developing English skills in the early years through preschools and early childhood education and we've supported a number of initiatives in that space. In schools, in relation to new migrants, as I canvassed, it is through the various migrant English programs that are supported. In relation to those who come to Australia to study, we want to ensure that there are high standards of support to develop their English skills before they commence those studies. So, in that sense, I would argue that we have a dedicated department focused very largely on English language skills as a core part of its functions, and that is certainly where we expect to drive— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Nobody has doubted for a moment that renewables will be an increasing share of the energy mix. That's not the point, because what you have put to me is a given, agreed to by almost everyone. The point is how to arrange the mix, how to manage this transition in a way that makes energy supply secure and makes housing most affordable. If you are theological about this, like the South Australian government was, and demand that 50 per cent of the energy mix be based upon renewables—in particular, intermittent power—then what you end up with is the kind of policy catastrophe that saw the entire state of South Australia blacked out because of poor policy and poor planning. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Analysis by Ernst &amp; Young has said that Labor's 50 per cent renewable target will create 28,000 new jobs and 34 per cent renewables by 2030 will create only 14,000 jobs. Why is Mr Turnbull turning his back on renewables and depriving Australia of over 14,000 jobs.</span>

It will grow the share of renewables in the mix. It will maintain Australia's commitment to our Paris targets. It will reduce the cost of electricity to households by between $110 and $115 a year, which is more than Dr Finkel's recommendations would have reduced it by.

Our National Energy Guarantee is expected to reduce wholesale electricity prices by about 20 to 25 per cent and household energy bills by about $100 to $115 a year.

More investment means more supply and lower prices. There won't be any cross-subsidies for any energy source, distorting the market and creating inefficiencies paid for by electricity consumers. It keeps coal going, which the Greens will be pleased to hear!—by far the most affordable energy source and, of course, our second-highest national export income earner. It reduces supply and price volatility, with fewer price spikes. It will help reduce prices overall. The National Energy Guarantee is a simpler and more commonsense system that is genuinely technology and resource neutral. All electricity generation options that support reliability and emissions reductions are on the table under our approach. This is not, of course, the case with the renewable energy target or clean energy target.</span>

The Labor Party used to be the party for the worker, but they don't care about the worker anymore; they now just care about feeding the extreme, left-wing, elitist agenda, which will lead to fewer jobs and lower wages, and they know it.

Senator Hinch has asked precisely how much has been repaid to date. I'll have to take that question on notice, Senator Hinch. I don't have those figures to hand, but I will happily provide an estimate to you in the chamber.</span>

Yes, we are asking those who have debts at present to pay them back a little bit faster, asking those on higher incomes to pay it back a little bit faster and asking people to start paying back a little bit faster, albeit at a slower or lower level or rate of repayments. We are equally introducing or proposing a performance contingent fund for universities to ensure that in the future there is greater linkage to the outcomes of students, including the employment outcomes of students, to make sure that future graduates align with the employment market and therefore good job prospects.</span>

Senator Williams, and all of us in the Nationals, are champions for regional Australia because we live in the regions, our families live in the regions and we know the value of regional Australia to our nation. Because we are connected to our communities, we recognise the concern in the communities about rising electricity prices. That's why the government is doing everything it can to make energy more affordable for households and businesses, from helping consumers to shop around for a better electricity deal to stopping electricity companies from gaming the system to fatten their margins.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that Australia is a nation of great resources. We know that the resources industry makes a great contribution to our nation. We know that our resources play a very important role in our energy plan. We, on this side, believe that we should be supporting a level playing field, an agnostic approach, that ensures coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar and batteries are all part of our energy mix.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission pointed out, a clean energy target provides no guarantee of turning around the increase in power prices. The new National Energy Guarantee is a key part of the government's response. It will deliver an affordable and reliable energy system as we transition to the energy system of the future. We will be providing certainty for investors in new and existing power plants to unlock more energy supply. We will be reducing the volatility in energy prices and ending subsidies for renewable energy, which are passed on to all energy consumers. Importantly, our plan will keep the lights on by putting in place a guarantee of reliable power so families and businesses will be ensured the readily available power is in the system at all times. Sadly, those opposite are not supporting an affordable and reliable energy system.</span>

The nearly eight million Australians and 540,000 businesses that operate in regional Australia can now have confidence we are delivering the energy security and affordability that they deserve. This integrated approach designed by experts that we announced today through the National Energy Guarantee will require retailers to invest directly in new generation capacity that is dispatchable and/or includes lower emissions, enter into contracts with generators specifying the emissions produced by that electricity, and contract with another retailer, as already occurs, that has overachieved its reliability and/or its emissions guarantee. This is an energy policy that backs our regional community and, indeed, communities everywhere. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The guarantee won't only put downward pressure on energy costs of around $100 to $115 per year to residential bills; it will ensure that we meet our emission targets as well. We know from the ACCC report released yesterday that the renewable subsidies those opposite are calling for will drive up the cost of energy, increase bills for households and put workers out of jobs. Unlike those opposite, we on this side do not believe that putting Australians out of a job is a sensible energy policy. We will always put regional families first and Australian workers first. We make no apology for protecting Australian workers and that is exactly what the coalition's National Energy Guarantee delivers.</span>

This morning, Minister Cash shared 'the good news about the impending closure of Holden', which has seen thousands of workers forced to find new jobs or retire. Isn't it clear that nothing has changed since former Treasurer Hockey goaded Holden to leave Australia? Why is the Liberal government celebrating the demise of automotive manufacturing in Australia?</span>

In fact, assistance since 2013 to help businesses transition into new industries is $255 million. Total assistance to assist those workers who have been affected since 2013 is $45 million. The number of workers that have been assisted to date is over 6,000. These workers have been provided with career training, advice and support. In addition to that, Holden advises that 75 per cent of Holden workers have found new jobs or retired. A further 10 per cent of those workers have put their hands up and they have actually said, 'I would like to look at something new,' and they are taking on new study.</span>

Senator Carr, these are the facts. In 2013, when Senator Carr was Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, automotive employment was down one-third from when Labor came into government in 2007. That happens to be a fact, Senator Carr. Motor vehicle production in 2013, when Senator Carr was the relevant minister, was down nearly 40 per cent.

The electricity guarantee that the Turnbull government has announced today, comprising a reliability guarantee and an emissions guarantee, will deliver the type of reliable, affordable energy Australia needs for the future. We know that households and businesses need to know that, when they flick the switch, the power will come through, the lights will go on and the doors of the business can be opened. The advice to government on the problem is clear. The independent security board has made it very clear that 'there is currently insufficient incentive to drive investment in new, flexible, dispatchable resources and maintain existing such resources'. They've defined the problem.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have also identified the solution in recommending the development of an obligation on retailers to meet a percentage of their load requirements with flexible and dispatchable resources. They've said that is resources that can be scheduled by the market operator, depending on the real-time operating needs of the system. That's the key phrase here: the real-time operating needs of the system. What does the energy market need at a given point in time to ensure that, when any household or business goes to turn on its electricity, the power is coming through, and coming through at the most affordable rate? The reliability guarantee will ensure that across Australia that certainty is delivered to Australian households and businesses in the future.</span>

It achieves both of these objectives, and it does so at least cost because it does so in a coordinated way, meeting these requirements simultaneously. It means that coal, gas, hydro and biomass will be rewarded or recognised for their dispatchability—that they can be put into the market when required—but lower emissions technologies including wind, solar and hydro will equally be recognised for their role in meeting the emissions reduction guarantee. The truth is that under these reforms reliability won't be traded away to meet emissions targets. Emissions targets won't be sacrificed to meet reliability. But what we will see is indeed that we will get both: we'll get the reliability and we'll meet the emissions targets. Most importantly to Australian users, the evidence is clear that we will do so at the lowest cost by using the existing electricity market systems.</span>

Now he's backing a National Energy Guarantee. It makes you wonder what he's going to be supporting and backing in tomorrow. Each of these positions, basically, is being pushed by the previous Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, who, it appears, has much more say on that side of the parliament than Mr Turnbull does.

                  </a>  It's been released, says Senator Brandis. Where would we find that, Senator Brandis? It's interesting—I haven't been able to find it. What Prime Minister Turnbull has done is turn his back on his own Chief Scientist. They have turned their back completely on the report that Dr Finkel put out. They have turned their back on renewable energy. Renewable energy is one of the things on the horizon that will create jobs and provide lots of opportunities in regional Australia. We heard Senator Scullion a moment ago talk about how they know regional Australia and how wonderful they are, but he read word for word off a piece of paper. How well does he know regional Australia when he has to read the answer to a dorothy dixer question from his own side? He can't even talk about regional Australia. Well, I tell you, I can—I talk to people on the west coast of Tasmania, who are waiting and have been waiting since Mr Abbott was the Prime Minister and absolutely wrecked the clean energy target, absolutely wrecked the wind industry and absolutely wrecked any renewable opportunities for industries to grow and grow in places where we absolutely need jobs.</span>

That's what this demonstrates. It's like they said: 'We've got a thought bubble today, so we'll run with that. It sounds like a great idea. We won't take any notice of what the Chief Scientist says—oh, no, he wouldn't know. He doesn't have the expertise. So we'll just come up with what we think will placate our backbench and other people and go along with Mr Tony Abbott.' It is a thought bubble to dump the Chief Scientist's recommendation.

Clearly, the announcement made this morning is the capitulation by the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, to Tony Abbott's hard right-wing agenda for Australia, which is now utterly complete. He's almost got there—the only thing that he's not doing is getting the salary of the Prime Minister.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was reported in newspapers this morning that renewable energy growth will be restricted over the coming three decades to just 4½ per cent—4½ per cent growth in the renewable energy industry over 30 years. That places at risk thousands and thousands of jobs in the renewable energy industry and makes it utterly clear that Australia is completely unable to satisfy and discharge its commitments around carbon pollution reduction that were made at the Paris conference in 2015. This government should be ashamed of itself for moving the goalposts. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:09</span>):  It's great to be following Senator Urquhart in taking note of the answers that were provided during question time, but I struggle to understand the point of view that Senator Urquhart is conveying in this chamber. She commenced her contribution by talking about rumours and media reports about what was announced today, rather than actually focusing on the facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking about ignoring experts was one of the points that Senator Urquhart made. As the Attorney-General pointed out in his answer to questions asked by the opposition today, it was, in fact, experts that were relied upon for the creation of this policy—people on the Energy Security Board, many of whom were appointed by the former Labor government. These are people that the shadow spokesperson for energy has termed as excellent appointments as well. Obviously, what they do is good, so why are these experts now not producing work that's acceptable to those on that side of the chamber?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not once in question time today did we hear the opposition talk about the issues of reliability and affordability—not at all. It was all about a particular obsession with one thing, and that's renewables—this talk of renewable jobs. I heard Senator Urquhart say that there will be thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs at risk because the renewables sector will only be growing at 4½ per cent. I thought I heard in there the word 'growing', which means that there should be more jobs being created. But it's like they're looking at that issue in isolation, not thinking about those who have to pay power bills—those factories that need affordable, reliable energy to be able to function and to produce the goods that they are there to produce and to support the workers who work in their factories, like dairy operations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of times during question time today there were references to obsessions with coal as well. Well, Senator Urquhart is a senator for Tasmania, as is Senator Singh, who asked one of the questions, the answers to which we are taking note of today. We also have a coalmine in our state, the Cornwall Coal Mine down on the east coast in the Fingal Valley, which employs a great many people in the regional community. Those opposite aren't concerned about those jobs. What about the people who work at the Cement Australia cement factory in Railton and the hundreds of people there? Does Senator Urquhart want to come with me to a factory located close to both of our electorate offices? Would she like to come out with me, meet the workers there and see how they feel about this notion of abandoning all support for industries that rely on that source of energy—a cheap source of energy? Probably not. I doubt she would accept my invitation to come out with me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The notion of doing away with subsidies is at the heart of this great policy, which draws a line in the sand and provides certainty moving forward. It creates a situation where we will have reliable and affordable energy. It is something people have been calling out for—business groups, individuals down the street and people on the other side of the chamber. It's something they've wanted for so long. But here we are providing it, and all we get are complaints and criticism. No real analysis, just typical opposition tactics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the subsidies proposed by the opposition in their policy are $66 billion worth of subsidies to prop up the jobs that Senator Urquhart was talking about. That's what they cost. Who pays for that? The taxpayer. They're paid for through people's power bills! It's okay for people who live down in the capital city and who don't have to earn their money—</span>

                  </a>  Indeed, this does honour our international commitments, taking Senator McKim's interjections. It does deal with that as well. But we seem to be hearing complaints from those opposite that it's all about one part of this debate. People need to turn their power on at home; they need power to live. Businesses need power to function. It's a simple thing that many on the other side seem to have missed. So I do urge senators opposite to go and familiarise themselves with the detail in the policy that was announced today and understand what it's all about. Grab a copy of the document and go and find out what it means to be committed to ensuring we have a reliable and affordable source of energy for our communities—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  In this question time we asked the question, and it's a logical question to ask: given the Prime Minister's many commitments to various approaches to climate policy, and given how many times he has adopted a position and abandoned it at the first headwind, how can we trust him on this latest announcement?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This latest announcement—a three-letter acronym, the NEG—is the new thing we're all supposed to believe in. But why is this any different from the litany of programs adopted by the Prime Minister and abandoned the moment Mr Abbott raised his voice? I can run through them again. He was a supporter of the ETS, he was a supporter of the carbon tax, he was a supporter of an EIS, he was a supporter of a CET and he was a supporter of a RET. Now he's the supporter of a NEG. It doesn't inspire a lot of confidence, does it? We're now into the fifth year of this government—the fifth year in a period where there has been an investment strike. The day this crowd came into the parliament and assumed government they decided to abolish any coherent policy approach to dealing with climate change; and the investment community, quite reasonably, just didn't know what to do. Without clear policy settings about how we intend to address climate change as a nation, it is impossible to make rational assessments about how to direct your investment. And indeed that is what we have been told over and over again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was interested to hear Senator Duniam implore us to 'listen to the experts'. Well, I'll remind him of this: the experts have been talking to us for some time. The experts from industry, the expert academic economists and the expert market economists have been talking to us. And what they've been saying to us is, 'You need to put some certainty around the investment environment.' We have waited for four years and we're into our fifth year ,and now we're expected to believe that the NEG is the thing that is going to create that certainty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw Senator Duniam waving around a glossy brochure, and I look forward to receiving my copy of that glossy brochure. I have spent the last hour and a half trawling the internet trying to find written down details of this policy that has been announced by a press release and, I understand, perhaps on a social media video from the Prime Minister. I think we deserve a little bit more than that. I think we need to understand the analysis and the modelling that lies behind the set of propositions that are being wheeled out now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I will tell you what I've been able to find out in the short time that's been able to me. This thing, this policy, involves an emissions guarantee. What is that? How will it work? We don't really know. We had some explanation read out rather laboriously by Senator Scullion. As far as I can tell, the actual target that will form the basis of this emissions guarantee is yet to be set. As far as I can tell from the reports being made in the media, this guarantee is something that is going to be 'worked through' in the lead-up to COAG. So, in fact, we've got absolutely no idea what it is that this guarantee represents. What part of the emissions reduction task that we are committed to in our Paris agreement will this emissions guarantee play? We don't know, because the level hasn't been set, and quite obviously the modelling associated with it has not been done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same with the reliability guarantee. What is the standard that is to be set? That hasn't been announced publicly and again, as I understand it, this is something to be 'worked through' as we approach COAG. This isn't a policy; this is a set of aspirations and a kind of plea that hopefully they can get together with state and territory governments and work something out as they approach the next COAG. Mr Frydenberg was asked today: 'How can you make these commitments about the cost to households, how can you make these commitments that costs will go down, if you have made none of the decisions about the actual targets to be established in this guarantee?' He responded in this way: 'The Commonwealth will be asking the AEMC to do detailed analysis and modelling of the specific proposal in the lead-up to discussions at COAG. We will provide, if you like, firmer estimates of those price effects. The price numbers you are referring to are based on, if you like, analysis and modelling of the market and the alternative schemes we have looked at in the past. It's an average over the 10 years.' Nothing there. Completely hopeless. All hot air. </span>

At the end of the parliamentary fortnight of this parliament four weeks ago the government successfully passed its media law reform package. In addition to that we've had success just this morning, today.

They scoff at that. Let me remind you that under the carbon tax in my home state of Western Australia residential consumers would have been $134 a year worse off under Labor's carbon tax policy.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those of you who watch question time, you might recall that over the last few weeks and the last few months Labor has been quick to criticise the government for not accepting each and every one of the Finkel review recommendations. Today, the Prime Minister has announced, after very careful consideration, a plan that builds on a very specific recommendation of the Finkel review. To make it easier for people who might be listening at home or listening and watching in the gallery, all you need to do is go to page 26 of the Finkel review, recommendation 7.2 under the title of 'Stronger governance'. It makes it very clear. The Finkel review says:</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  The worst-kept secret has been revealed today. Who would have thought that we would be in some way shocked to hear that the coalition government has decided to baulk on the Finkel review's clean energy target. The worst-kept secret that Australians have been waiting to hear has come to fruition. And not only has the Prime Minister turned his back on his own chief scientist, but, in doing so, he has embraced the former Prime Minister Tony Abbott's vision of Australian energy, which brings Australia's energy policy back to the 1950s.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what is really, really unclear is what this new energy policy of the government is really all about, because we are hearing conflicting views when it comes to detail—as usual—from this Turnbull government. The AEMC CEO, Mr John Pierce, today told Sky News that there are indeed different modelling scenarios when it comes to the National Energy Guarantee. This is where Australians are again completely bewildered as to what this government's policy is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Prime Minister and the energy minister have been spruiking an average annual power bill reduction of $115 under these new energy reforms. But now we hear from the AEMC's John Pierce that there are different modelling scenarios, and it may indeed be as low as $25 a year according to some confidential modelling. So what is the reality here? How can this government try and hoodwink the Australian people into believing there will be a saving of $115 a year when a very pre-eminent individual by the name of John Pierce, from the AEMC, who the government has been relying on, has made it very clear there are different scenarios and one scenario is as low as $25? That just completely blows this policy out of the water. And all of the rhetoric that Malcolm Turnbull, Minister Josh Frydenberg and the Leader of Government in the Senate, Senator Brandis, have been spruiking is why Labor today asked pertinent questions as to the detail of what this is all about.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Brandis:</span>
                  </a>  You were the only one who asked a question.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator SINGH:</span>
                  </a>  Indeed I did ask questions, Senator Brandis, around investment in renewables and around investment in jobs—because we rely very much on analysis such as that done by Ernst &amp; Young, which said Labor's 50 per cent renewable target will create 28,000 jobs, whereas Prime Minister Turnbull has turned his back on renewables and therefore turned his back on thousands of new renewable energy jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />So not only are we losing out on jobs, we're also losing out on the savings that this government continues to rely on because of what I have just alluded to in the Senate and made clear in the Senate—that the Australian Energy Market Commission's chair, John Pierce, has made it very clear that there are different modelling scenarios and, under one scenario, the savings for families will be just $25 a year in 2020. What a great policy this is that this government is trying to hoodwink the Australian people with! Well, the only one who is buying this policy, the only one who's probably cracking open the champagne right now, is former Prime Minister Tony Abbott—because, let's face it, he is the one who's still really running this country. He is the one that Malcolm Turnbull continues to capitulate to. He is the one, along with the other hard-right members in the coalition, who this government has completely sold out to. Senator Brandis, you should be ashamed and embarrassed because I know you're not one of those hard-right members of the coalition. But, in doing nothing and in going along with them, you certainly have sold yourself out, as has the Prime Minister. But you didn't only sell out what's important for Australia—to be a leader in energy and renewable energy, to have the right energy mix for the country; you also hoodwinked Australians in the process. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This policy that we have seen from the government today is perilously close to a clinically insane policy. We know that Australians want more renewable energy. Poll after poll shows that Australians want more renewable energy, yet this announcement, on the face of it, sounds the death knell for the renewable energy target and sells out every single Australian who wants to see strong climate action and wants to see more renewable energy in the mix. It sells out those Australians. It sells the Great Barrier Reef down the drain. It sells the Murray-Darling Basin and its ecology, on which so many regional jobs depend, straight down the drain—flushed after the Great Barrier Reef. It's worth pointing out that as we stand here today the Great Barrier Reef is dying, there are horrendous wildfires burning in Portugal and—hello!—there's a tropical cyclone bearing down on Ireland. Yet this is the day, of all days, that the Prime Minister announces he is selling renewables down the drain and is going to hop straight into bed with his mates in the coal sector. Make no mistake, this government has not only sold out future generations; it has sold out our climate for a few months respite from the climate criminals like Tony Abbott on its backbench.</span>

You have to ask yourself: how do those in this government sleep at night when they're selling the Great Barrier Reef down the drain and selling renewables down the drain with it? I've got an answer. I know how they sleep at night: on mattresses stuffed with hundred dollar bills donated by their mates in the coal industry. That's what this policy has delivered on today. It's delivered on the wishes of the coal industry in this country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's payday today for the coal industry in Australia. The fossil fuel industry donates millions of dollars to the Labor and Liberal parties in every election cycle, and for that money they get policy outcomes from the Liberal-National party such as those we've seen today. The LNP don't care about future generations, because they want the economy to work for the big polluters and no-one else. They don't care, because young people actually don't matter to them. We see that in housing policy settings and private health insurance policy settings and we've had it confirmed again today—as if we needed it—in the government's energy policy announcement. They don't care about young people today and they don't care about young people into the future. If they did they would be announcing policies that drove a more rapid uptake of renewable energy, a more rapid transition out of coal-fired power in this country. But they don't do that, because they only care about their massive donors in the fossil fuel industry in this country and their post-parliamentary careers in the fossil fuel sector.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is growing increasingly delusional. Those opposite are attacking Australia's biggest polluter, AGL, for not being pro coal enough. They are attacking Australia's biggest miners because they are moving away from coal. They're attacking the big banks because they don't want to risk their shareholders' money by investing in coal. This government has completely lost the plot. I am sorry to say that in this country energy policy is one of the major casualties of that losing of the plot. It is chopped and changed day to day. New thought bubbles are announced from week to week. Last week we had Tony Abbott sacrificing goats to volcanos, and this week we have Malcolm Turnbull asking, 'How high?' when Mr Abbott has told him to jump. Energy policy in this country is a disgrace and I apologise to future generations for the misery that announcements like today's are heaping on them.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you. The coalition strongly opposed Labor's repeal of the voluntary student unionism laws passed under the Howard government. For many Liberals and conservatives, guaranteeing students the basic right to freely associate and not be forced to join or contribute funds to a student union has been a lifelong principle. The government will support part (a).</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, part (b) does not reflect the key principle of ensuring freedom of association for all students at all times. It creates an illusion of voluntary student unionism through the use of campus- or institution-wide ballots. Compelling all students to join and fund an organisation by a ballot of their peers is just as illegitimate on campus as if it happened in a workplace or anywhere else in our community. As such, I ask that the question on part (a) be put separately from the question on part (b).</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Coal is dying. It's an industry in structural decline and almost every other leader in the world understands this except for Malcolm Turnbull and Donald Trump. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The world is rapidly moving away from dirty old coal – a legacy technology – and making the transition towards clean, green renewable energy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2017, coal makes no sense. It doesn't stack up economically or environmentally and it is literally killing people. Not only are the emissions from coal-fired generation making global warming worse, but chemicals like mercury and sulphur dioxide are also being spewed into our atmosphere from burning coal. In Australia, we emit mercury at double the global average and inhaling it and other toxic chemicals carries serious health risks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Coal doesn't even work when you need it to. During heatwaves in NSW, Liddell was unable to perform as two of its generator units were unable to switch on due to unforeseen boiler tube leaks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There's a reason that no-one in the private sector is building new coal-fired power stations. It doesn't stack up economically. No-one is interested in investing billions of dollars into a giant coal-fired power station that no-one is going to want to switch on in a few years. No-one is interested in sinking capital investment into an ageing technology when the cost of renewables is plummeting and getting cheaper by the day. Investing in coal is about as sensible as investing in a company that builds fax machines and type-writers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The cost of renewables is plummeting and we live in one of the sunniest, windiest places in the world. If this government had any vision, they'd be positioning Australia to take advantage of the energy revolution. We would be leading the world in renewable energy technology, we'd have some of the lowest prices in the world and we'd be reducing pollution across the economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Instead, we're being left behind. While Minister Frydenberg waxes lyrical about the falling cost of renewables, China is getting on with it and introducing an Emissions Trading Scheme. While the Treasurer and Minister Joyce throw chunks of coal around in Parliament, Germany has been getting up to 85 percent of its electricity from renewable sources on sunny, windy days this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure we transition to a nation that is powered by renewables, we need to do two things at once: rapidly introduce clean, cheap, reliable renewable energy into the system, and conduct an orderly retirement of coal-fired power stations. Renewables in, coal out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But that hasn't stopped this government from peddling their dangerous obsession with coal. So now, we have to stop them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The conservatives in this place only live and die by the market when it suits them. Right now – markets around the world are forcing out coal and the falling cost of renewables and storage is only going to make them more competitive. So now they're openly talking about frantically pulling on the only lever that's available to them – using public money that should be going to schools and hospitals to fund coal. This is a truly desperate and despicable step by a Prime Minister that's doing anything he can to hang onto power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Now, the government is trying to build a public case to keep the decrepit old clunker Liddell open, a joint that's held together by spit and sticky-tape. Liddell is falling apart and the current owners, AGL, don't want to spend the money keeping it open, so some in the government are talking about dipping into the public purse to help this old station stay open.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It should be illegal to use public money in this way. Public money that should be going to schools and hospitals. Public money that should be spent on science and research. Public money that should be spent on reducing inequality in this country and ensuring that everyone has access to a high quality education. Public money that should be spent securing our renewable energy future. Public money should be used in the public interest. If the government is wanting to use public money to burn our planet and make climate change worse, that should be illegal. We have to stop them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The private Senator's bill I introduce today, the Coal-Fired Power Funding Prohibition Bill 2017 prohibits: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the Commonwealth providing financial support to refurbish or build a coal-fired power station; and </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Commonwealth purchasing, or assisting with the purchase or transfer or ownership, of a coal-fired power station.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, this bill does ensure that the government can provide public money to transition-affected workers into new industry or use public money to manage the closure of a coal-fired power station.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Let's be very clear about this: Coal. Kills. Whether it's through the toxic pollutants it spews into the atmosphere that affect the air we breathe, or the global warming that it accelerates that will destroy our way of life – we need to stop burning coal. Already, industry and investment are moving away from coal. No major financial institution in Australia wants to finance Adani and no-one is interested in building new coal-fired power stations. This government and the Trumps in the backbench who control it are resisting and opposing what the markets they claim to worship are telling them, what the science is telling them, what the private sector is telling them, what public opinion is telling them and, most importantly, what the world is telling them. In their blind, dangerous resistance they are turning to the only option they have left: a culture war.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They're using their leverage over Prime Minister Turnbull to condemn our future generations and the Greens are the only ones willing to stand in the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Why? Because you can't count on Labor to do it. Labor and Liberals are wedded to each other and wedded to coal. The Labor party tries to talk the talk on renewables and a Clean Energy Target, but then, when the Greens introduce a motion into this place to rule out any attempts to extend the life of Liddell and to develop a plan for an orderly transition away from coal, where do they vote? They vote with the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Because when push comes to shove, the Labor party are still beholden to the fossil fuel companies. Labor are still in the pocket of coal. Worse still, the revolving door between big interests isn't just for the Coalition, but the Labor party as well. According to an article published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Conversation </span>on the 22 of June last year, Martin Ferguson, Craig Emerson and Greg Combet all either took up management jobs with mining and energy companies and associations or worked as consultants for them. Earlier this year, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian </span>revealed that Cameron Milner, who has worked for the premier of QLD and in the Leader of the Opposition's office, is volunteering with the ALP while keeping his day job as director and registered lobbyist at Next Level Strategic Services (NLSS), which counts among its clients Indian miner Adani.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But, the Greens have a plan. We've got a plan to extend the Renewable Energy Target which – despite what Senator Abetz and Mr Abbott say – is working, a plan to legislate a national storage target to run Australia on 100% renewable energy, a plan to transition workers from coal communities into the jobs of the future and a plan to re-regulate electricity prices to bring costs down and provide much needed relief for families around this country. We've laid out this plan and we're confident that if it was implemented, we could stabilise the grid, restore investment confidence and end the investment strike on renewables, bring down pollution, bring down prices and meet our paltry Paris obligations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is ideology and weakness, from the Coalition and from Labor, that are standing in the way of the energy revolution. Instead, what we are served up from our government is fear-mongering that falsely blames blackouts on renewables. It is juvenile name-calling in the chamber and it is a government that instead of taking real action to bring down prices, forces energy retailers to write letters to customers telling them how much they've been ripped off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Enough is enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I urge the Labor party and the crossbench to find the courage to support this bill so we can take one important step forward, when the government insists on going backwards. Our precious, scarce public money should not be used propping up old, clunky and dirty coal-fired power stations. If the government doesn't understand that, then we need to make sure that they can't waste our money on this ever again.</span>

                  </a>  The coalition government believes in a welfare system that tackles poverty by helping people achieve independence and breaks cycles of welfare dependency. The best way to make a child's life better is to ensure parents are not dependent on welfare. That's why the primary focus of the coalition government is moving people from welfare to work, and that's shown by the over 800,000 jobs this government has created. This government is protecting children from poverty by guaranteeing homelessness funding that Labor left without a single dollar in their last budget. Our commitment to protecting children is evident in our No Jab, No Pay policy that keeps children safe from horrible diseases. The coalition government will continue to deliver policies across government to provide security and opportunity for the children of this country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it that almost a third of our youth are either unemployed or underemployed? I'm talking about kids between the ages of 15 and 24. And that stat isn't anything new. These figures have been around since the global financial crisis. I do note that our labour participation rate this year, which is around 62 per cent, is the highest it's been for around five years, and I hope it continues to grow, but I am surprised to learn that last year over 343,000 international student visas were granted. The department of immigration and citizenship does know this figure. How many of these students work, where do they work and do they get paid in cash or report it to the ATO? Apparently, around 100,000 young people on student visas work up to 20 hours a week. That's great. What happens to the other 200,000 people? We don't know. How is this possible? Meanwhile, we've got 273,000 local kids between the ages of 15 and 24 who are struggling, not working, and could be contributing to our local economy. I think it's important that we discover just how many jobs out there could have been taken up by young Australian people but instead were taken up by individuals on international student visas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RHIANNON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  This motion, while it suggests that there's a concern from One Nation about levels of unemployment, is again a dog-whistling attempt to divide Australians, pit people against each other and turn Australians and people who live in this country against international students. We need to be concerned about underemployment, unemployment and the pressure that they're putting on people. The economy is not working for so many people, but attacking international students is not the way to go. International students actually are a source of cheap labour in this country. I congratulate the unions, who have taken a very fine lead here. They're working with many people from overseas, many of them students, who end up being so exploited. Often they're being paid between $10 and $14 an hour. Many of us would be served by these people when we go to cafes and restaurants, when we buy petrol and in convenience stores. It is a very serious problem, but not in the way it's defined by this motion. This motion is, in fact, very divisive and a real setback. As I just said, I congratulate the unions, who have been working to assist international students who are being exploited. Sometimes these companies are pretty ruthless. They often go belly up because they just want to reinvent themselves as phoenix companies, and the former workers are left with no money—and this can happen overnight. They even lose the meagre weekly income that they have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the Fair Entitlements Guarantee scheme. That scheme was set up to step in when workers are left with nothing. What we find, though, is that they only provide support for people who cannot recover their entitlements and are Australian residents. Again, this is where these international students are so hard done by. They are paid appalling wages, and working conditions are absolutely shocking. Often there's a bit of racism on the side. Often they end up out of work, and there's nobody there to defend them. But, again, some unions have stepped in to fight for their conditions, even though they're often not members of the union. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their situation with regard to unemployment and underemployment is very serious in this country. And this is what we should be concentrating on: ensuring that there are well paid jobs that are unionised and have good working conditions for everybody. The Unemployed Workers' Union is doing some fine work in this area. From their analysis of the figures, there are more than 725,000 people unemployed and 1,059,000 underemployed. And this is very characteristic of Australia, as it has been for about the last 10 years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">International students are an easy target for One Nation, and that is another disgraceful example of their tactics. There are more than half a million international students in this country—at our universities, at our TAFEs, at the private vocational schools—and many of them need to work. They're legally allowed to work for 20 hours a week. And they have to work, in many cases, because the cost of living is considerable in this country, and it is going up all the time. We know how tough it is to find rental accommodation at any reasonable price—many either have to, because of some of the private colleges they're at, or feel they should pay up-front fees. And so they do get caught up in illegal work. You've got the legal aspects of the work that many of the international students get involved in, and there's the illegal employment market as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We depend on these international students. Remember the huge revenue that they bring into our country. And there has been some shocking racism. There was a tragic situation with some Indian students. How we were treating these students here became a very big issue in India in terms of racism when they were studying and how they were treated at work. For the federal parliament to be debating a motion with this type of wording is destructive. It's more than unhelpful. It sends a very bad message not just to the international students themselves but to their communities and to the countries that they come from about what sort of country we are and what sort of people we are. It says that we're not really welcoming here. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly many of these people need to find work. And I want to emphasise that that work should be paid according to award wages. They should have decent working conditions, they should be able to join the union and they should be respected at work. They should not become just a cheap source of labour that allows so many of these companies to profit and to really boost their profits in such a shocking way. They take advantage of the fact that these students, many times, are very concerned that they'll get caught out and so they don't complain. This motion is a destructive, divisive motion and clearly should be defeated. </span>

This motion propagates some of those misconceptions; indeed, there are others, including some that Senator Rhiannon just spoke of. There are a number of misconceptions. Importantly, it is critical in the first instance to highlight that international students studying in Australia make an enormous net positive contribution to Australia in a number of ways. They make an enormous net positive contribution to the Australian economy, to education in Australia, and, indeed, to employment in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The growth of international education provision in our universities, in non-university higher education institutions, in our vocational education and training institutes, including TAFEs, across our schools and across English language providers, has been a remarkable success story of modern Australia. It is perhaps the most significant example of the way in which our economy has transitioned to create jobs and export income through a knowledge based services economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The numbers are quite stark now. International education is the third-largest export earner for Australia. It generates an estimated $28 billion in activity in Australia. That's students, and their families and friends who visit while they're here, spending on accommodation in Australia, on restaurants and services in Australia, on travelling and touring in Australia and, yes, on their education while in Australia. All of those different activities stimulate, of course, jobs and other opportunities for Australians. Deloitte Access Economics estimates that international education underpins now and supports some 130,000 Australian jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, contrary to the notion put in this motion, it is very, very clear that international education is stimulating jobs and opportunities elsewhere across Australia. As an area of earning export income into Australia, it's now our third-largest international earner—the third-largest export earner for Australia—such is the role it's played in the transformation of our economy, and, of course, it is the largest such earner in the services sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to appreciate that there are strong protections and frameworks within which international education operates. Only providers who are registered can offer international education services to foreign students. Those providers then have strong safeguards put around their operations. There are protections for those international students, but there are also protections for Australians in terms of what those international students can do whilst they're in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are limits on the number of hours the international students can work whilst they're in Australia. Indeed, they are limited to working 40 hours a fortnight. But, notably, most don't do that. In fact, estimates predict that only around 36 per cent of international higher education students, or around 40 per cent of overall international students, seek any kind of work whilst they're in Australia. The significant majority are here to study and to live and learn the Australian experience, and that's precisely what they get on and do. And they do that while spending their money, often their parents' money or their country's money, here in Australia, creating jobs and opportunities for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are proudly now the world's third most popular destination, after the United States and the United Kingdom, for students to come and study in. Even with limits on their work rights whilst here, and even with limits on their work rights post graduation, we still now stand, for the vast majority of students who come here, as their first-preference destination. They choose to come here, knowing that we limit their work rights, because of the quality of education and experience that we offer to those students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In doing so, it's not just our economy that they enhance. They also enhance our educational institutions and, within that, the experience of domestic Australian students as well. They enhance our educational institutions because, yes, they are a significant additional revenue source for those educational institutions, which can enhance other activities, such as research undertakings by Australian institutions and, indeed, other investments that they put into universities and those other educational institutions. But, as I said, they also enhance the opportunity for domestic students whom they're studying alongside, because in the end they create a richer study experience—exposure to foreign cultures and different business approaches, language approaches or otherwise—which, importantly, ensures that Australian graduates get a more rounded education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, those safeguards apply. Just last week the Turnbull government took steps to enhance those safeguards by ensuring that, in terms of the English language skills the international students have when they're completing an English language program prior to commencing a tertiary level of study in Australia, there are clear, required assessment processes in place to guarantee that they are able to fully participate. We do that to make sure that it's fair to those international students so that they get a quality education; to the domestic students, whom they're studying alongside, to make sure that everybody in their classes can fully and equally participate; and, of course, to the teachers in institutions at which they're studying, to make sure that they are able to give the best-quality educational experience possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Rhiannon spoke with some negativity about the experience international students have in Australia. That's another misconception I'd like to refute. Surveys indicate that more than 90 per cent of people who study in Australia report an overwhelmingly positive experience of their studies. Work has been undertaken by the Fair Work Ombudsman and others to make sure that there is not exploitation of international students, and I would urge international students, who we now work closely with through our international education strategy, to engage with appropriate authorities such as the Fair Work Ombudsman if they have any concerns about workplace practices. Australia overwhelmingly provides a positive study experience, a positive lifestyle experience and some work experience for those who choose to take it—but a very positive, high-quality experience overall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I note, there has been some more media commentary about the impact that international, and particularly Chinese, students may have on the operation of some Australian universities and providers. Our government has been very clear in the view that the academic integrities and freedoms—freedom of expression—at Australian universities are of paramount importance. They should be defended at all costs. Nobody should question the reality that freedom of expression exists at our universities, and everybody should fully expect to have their thoughts and ideas challenged. Equally, I'd say, in relation to misconceptions, that it's unhelpful sometimes when media outlets, in particular, decide to frame stories in a way that suggests there are profound problems, with little evidence in the stories to back up those suggestions. Just as we expect that students from China or elsewhere embrace the freedoms at Australian universities and campuses while they are here, we should acknowledge that whilst they are here they are free to gather to celebrate appropriately their national days or their national traditions as they choose and see fit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, Australia has an education system that is the envy of much of the world. That's why people vote with their feet and come here. It's a system whose contributions to our economy and to the experience of Australian students are enhanced by the international students who come here. Contrary to the impression that this motion gives, far from undermining Australian jobs, the international education industry with its $28 billion contribution creates some 130,000 Australian jobs, as I have said in estimates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the Turnbull government remain resolute in our commitment to work with international education providers to give the best-quality educational experience to all possible and to continue to grow these opportunities because of the positive contribution they make to all of Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="112096" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  I too rise today to oppose this urgency motion on international student visas put forward by One Nation. At the outset, I have to say it seems to me that this is another attempt by the One Nation party to grab a cheap headline at the expense of the truth, playing on elements of racism and a version of the 'other', of someone who is different to me, through a motion which expressly goes to the issue of international students. This motion is an absolute contradiction, because it's not that long ago in this place that One Nation, along with a few of the other crossbenchers, supported the government's ABCC legislation. That legislation prohibits unions from negotiating to limit the number and use of overseas workers with building companies who tender for government contracts. I don't know how they missed that, but they clearly did. The One Nation party, with the government, expressly put in place a limit on a union's ability to limit in an enterprise agreement the number of overseas workers in a company engaged in government tendering. What a contradiction. They also went to limit rostered days off, limit the ordinary hours of overtime and so on and so forth. But the standout feature is we have this so-called urgency motion today on international students and yet we have a party that absolutely voted with the government to say to trade unions: when you're negotiating with building companies who tender with the government, you will be restricted in outlawing overseas workers. That's exactly what One Nation did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other surprising feature for me about this urgency motion is that Senator Georgiou like myself and, indeed, like you, Acting Deputy President Reynolds, is a Western Australian. We know in Western Australia we have, I think, three One Nation upper house members in the state parliament. So I can only assume that Senator Georgiou didn't talk to them; otherwise, they would have been able to tell him that the McGowan government has, indeed, put forward a very bold plan in partnership with the universities in Western Australia to make Perth a destination for international students to bolster our economy because, as Senator Birmingham pointed out, international students add to our economy. So once again we have this contradiction between what the One Nation senators in this place think and perhaps what their colleagues in the Western Australian state parliament think.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that international students are not the problem with our job market. Twenty hours a week is what they work, as Senator Birmingham explained to the parliament. But we know that what's happening in our economy right at the moment is it's not the international students; it's the low wages growth. Low wages growth is now starting to have a real impact on our economy because, obviously, when families and individuals don't have decent wage growth—in the private sector it's been as low as 1.8 per cent; the lowest it's been in at least two decades—that impacts spending power, it impacts the way that households are able to meet their expenses and it also impacts on employment. So this furphy around international students is nothing but a cheap headline, another attempt by One Nation not backed up with any kind of facts or figures, trying to scapegoat international students, when, as I said at the outset, One Nation, by voting with the government, sought to restrict our unions' ability to limit the use of overseas workers in their enterprise agreements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And who could forget the words of the Reserve Bank Governor, Philip Lowe, a couple of months ago, when he called on workers to demand higher pay rises? He said workers need to demand higher pay rises amid a wage growth crisis. When you look at all of those who analyse our labour markets, no-one of any competence is talking about international students; they are talking about low wages. We've seen the disgraceful way the government has failed to acknowledge its own public service and give public servants a decent wage rise. From the day that Mr Abbott was elected Prime Minister, there has been a war on our public servants. Very few of our public servants have had wage rises, and that policy has continued under Mr Turnbull. So we've seen very low or no wage growth in the public sector. We've seen an absolute stalling of wages in the private sector to the tune that analysts and the Reserve Bank governor—hardly a friend of workers—have started saying it's time that workers demanded a wage rise. That's the issue in our economy. It has nothing to do with picking on and scapegoating international students, many of whom have come here from near neighbours who are also often scapegoated by the One Nation party. They had obviously not bothered to talk to their colleagues in the WA parliament, because they would have certainly told them that we are very, very clear and committed to making Perth a destination for international students. Perhaps Senator Georgiou doesn't know this because he's a fairly new senator, but, nevertheless, he's a Western Australian senator and he gets a lot of staff, so he could have done the background work on this. Perth was the No. 1 destination for international students. We've lost that status, and we want to get it back, because we do appreciate that international students make our economy stronger. They bring a lot of wealth. They pay rent, they buy services and they sometimes work—they're limited in their ability to work to 20 hours—and that's the sort of growth that we want to see in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government hasn't always done the right thing by international students. We've seen the appalling rip-off at 7-Eleven. I presided over a visa inquiry when I was the chair of the Senate Education and Employment References Committee and, quite frankly, I was shocked by the level of exploitation of those students that I saw. They were working for minimal wages and they were being forced to pay back wages. Instead of trying to, wrongly, demonise international students, One Nation and the government should be making sure that we never, ever again see the exploitation that we saw of these guests in our country. Most of them are here for a short time. They come in and take advantage of our good education facilities, and yet, at the same time, they get treated in a way that none of us would stand for as workers in this country. No-one is convinced we have seen the end of that rip-off at 7-Eleven. It's probably still going on. In fact, I think it's definitely still going on, as I speak. We know most of those workers in the 7-Eleven stores are international students who are often forced to work more than 20 hours, forced to work for free and forced to pay back wages. They don't get their proper entitlements and they have never seen a penalty rate and so on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want further proof, we also know that in the Western Australian state election this year One Nation gave its preferences to the Liberal Party that wants to reduce wages, that doesn't stand for penalty rates and that has presided over critically high unemployment in Western Australia. That's the party that One Nation chose to support in the recent state election: a party that doesn't support a minimum wage and that thinks workers can be ripped off on the weekends and not get penalty rates. I don't know where this concocted notion about international students comes from; it's completely wrong. One Nation should have taken a better look at the bills it supported in the past were it specifically outlawed overseas workers. This should be dismissed. It's nothing but a headline grabber.</span>

                  <a href="241710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  I'm delighted, this afternoon, to make my contribution to what I think is an important motion from Senator Georgiou—a One Nation senator from my home state of Western Australia—but I'm going to be a little bit more gracious. I think what Senator Georgiou is trying to do is highlight the important plight of young Australians that are looking for work. I don't think it's a bad idea that Senator Georgiou, who is a new senator here in the Senate from Western Australia, has spent some time thinking about what could be the various causes of that problem, or that he has invited us in this place to sit down and discuss whether or not we think this particular cause has merit or whether or not other causes have merit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I'd like to do, in the brief opportunity available to me this afternoon, is to talk about why I don't think it is right to look at international students but how I do think that there are other opportunities to provide jobs growth, particularly in our home state of Western Australia. Of course, Senator Georgiou won't be surprised to learn that I'm putting my effort and consideration into reform of the GST system and why I think that will be a great opportunity, not just in Western Australia. I think I might have heard Senator Polley scoff at my idea of goods and services tax distribution reform in our country. I'm pleased to say, Senator Polley, that none other than the Productivity Commission itself, in its draft report into horizontal fiscal equalisation, says that there is opportunity for reform in our country of the GST system. I'm pleased that the New South Wales Treasurer has even endorsed reform. I'm pleased that the new Labor government in Western Australia—as the previous Liberal government did—has also endorsed reform. I'm delighted that my parliamentary colleague the Treasurer, Mr Morrison, embraced an idea—led by me and endorsed by other Western Australian Liberals—that said that the GST system needs review. I will come back to that in a moment, and why I think that Senator Georgiou's sentiment is correct, even if I don't necessarily agree with the first proposition that he has put forward this afternoon. But that doesn't mean we should dismiss it, because we know that things change and our economic conditions change. Indeed, the contribution that international students make to our country will continue to change over time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'm one who believes that the existence and the participation of international students in our education system and in the broader Australian economy benefits our community and our cultural development as a nation and of course enhances our economic development. The economic benefits of international students in Australia are undeniable. Education is our third-largest import. It has contributed over $28 billion to the Australian economy in such a short time—in the period 2016 to 2017. Estimates by Deloitte Access Economics are that international education creates over 130,000 jobs across a range of sectors. As Senator Lines alluded to, it's certainly my ambition and my hope that the new Western Australian government—I had hoped it would have been an ambition of the previous government, but it wasn't to be so—will commit its time and its energy to doing more to attract international students to Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, once students are here in Australia, they are expected to focus primarily on their educational studies, which is why international students can only work 40 hours in every fortnight. A national student survey found that only 36 per cent of international higher education students reported working while studying, while 87 per cent of vocational education and training, or VET, students did. This equated to around 200,000 students: 90,000 higher education students and 110,000 VET students in 2016. We also know that less than 40 per cent of international students seek any kind of work in Australia and some of those are engaged in volunteering activities rather than in paid work. When they compete against Australians in the job market, research—specifically, from the Australian Council for Educational Research—demonstrates that it is usually the Australians who win, not the international students. Importantly, most international student employment is in jobs that employers find hard to fill, meaning that international students might have an interest, a capacity and a need to fill those jobs that Australian students—young Australians—might not be interested in filling in the first instance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think it is worth just examining the evidence in a little bit more detail, before I do move on to what I think might be a better way to address the issue of employment and educational opportunities for young people. We also know that the ABS has recently reported that international education income has reached $28 billion in 2016-2017. Significantly, it is up 16 per cent from the year before. Of course, as one of our largest service exports, Australian international education is leading the transition of our economy, the Australian economy, from one that's centred on mining to a broader knowledge and services based economy. This is very important and leads me to my substantive point about the importance of GST distribution reform. I think the argument has been well made in this Senate by Western Australian colleagues of mine. We don't hear Labor Senate colleagues from Western Australia talking too much about GST distribution reform. In arguing for an independent, economically focused review of Australia's horizontal fiscal equalisation arrangements, which the Treasurer commissioned and which is the subject of the draft report that was released only in the last few weeks, what Western Australian Liberals have been arguing for is that GST distribution reform, while important to Western Australia, is not just limited to benefiting Western Australia and that, in fact, if we're going to have the macroeconomic reform that is needed in this country to propel it to the next stage of growth, the next stage of productivity, it is important that every element of the economy come under close examination—forensic examination, in fact. I would argue that the GST system has gone unchallenged for too long. What's been very, very valuable about the draft Productivity Commission report is that it has at least opened up the issue of horizontal fiscal equalisation and opened up the issue of GST distribution reform to make sure that that system is doing everything that it possibly can to support growth and to support productivity in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of months ago, with the support of the Parliamentary Library—and I am very, very grateful for the work that they were able to do on my behalf—it was revealed that, in the period 2000-01 to 2015-16, WA had contributed $186 billion to the rest of Australia. That is a big figure, and I'll be the first one to say that, when you go out into the community and talk about $186 billion, people don't know what it means. How do you digest what $186 billion means to your local economy? So I'm grateful for the help of the Parliamentary Library. They were able to turn that into an infrastructure loss figure but also an employment loss figure. As a result of that, we know that Western Australia lost $73.1 billion in possible infrastructure spending as a result of a flawed GST distribution system. And, more particularly relevant to Senator Georgiou's motion this afternoon, Western Australia lost, on average, 94,000 jobs over that period. It lost 94,000 jobs over that period.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this afternoon I agree with the sentiment of Senator Georgiou that we should be doing more to make jobs available to young Australians, but I would argue that Senator Georgiou should join with me and other Western Australian Liberal senators in arguing for GST distribution reform, because it will deliver important infrastructure spending, and it will deliver important jobs growth. You're right, Senator Hanson—I saw you nodding your head. To your credit, Senator Georgiou is on the bandwagon and is on the campaign supporting GST distribution reform in Western Australia. It was great to wake up to headlines like this in Western Australia, because we know that reform of anything in our country takes time and takes energy, but the most important thing is that it's a demonstration that, unfortunately, the squeaky wheel gets the oil. I am pleased that Western Australian Liberal senators and members have been squeaking those wheels, and we are on the path to— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  I rise to speak on this matter as well. When I first saw this, this morning, I thought, 'Maybe One Nation are going to express some concern for foreign workers that have been exploited.' We've seen various examples of that over recent years. But, no, I think what we've got with One Nation is just another dog whistle. We know that Senator Hanson has attacked foreign students in this country as early as in February this year, where she said: 'I was told—and I was just gobsmacked at this—that we had 400,000 foreign students in Australia, going to our universities. No wonder our kids can't find jobs. I think it needs to be addressed.' So what we see today is just a continuing attack on foreign students in this country and the importance of them to the economy of Australia and particularly regional economies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you'd spent any time in regional Queensland, you would understand the importance of foreign students to those universities and the fact that they add diversity to them, let alone the role that that plays in the broader Asia-Pacific and within the world. There are some Queensland issues that I want to come back to that I think just show you how out of touch Senator Hanson and her team are with what is happening in Queensland and indeed throughout Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know many other senators here have raised the importance of this to the national economy, but it's broader than that. You only have to spend any time in Brisbane to understand the economic boom that Brisbane has gone through as a result of foreign students wanting to come and study at our universities. We have seen high-rise buildings get built and we have seen students come and use that accommodation. We have seen that the resulting economic benefit has been substantial. This has been replicated throughout Queensland and throughout Australia. It shows the ignorance that we have seen from One Nation. They fail to understand the economic importance of this to our country. They say it's a bad thing that we have 400,000 international students studying right here in Australia. I see that as an opportunity. They get an education. Australia has so many universities ranked in the top 100, and our regional universities are doing particularly well. We're an attractive destination, and this is a great thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When they come, they also obviously want to work. They need some employment to keep it going. Quite often they are doing the jobs that some other people don't want to do, but we can't let them be exploited when they are doing that. There have been examples of that throughout regional Queensland, and I am sure there are examples throughout Australia as well. But One Nation don't want to put a focus on that. Every time they've had an opportunity to vote for antiworker or anti-union legislation, they've put their hand up as quick as a flash. If they actually wanted to protect international workers and vulnerable workers, they would vote to strengthen labour laws, not diminish them, and they would actually vote to strengthen the role of unions in the workplace who can protect these people. But we see from One Nation a consistent theme: the opposite. It just shows how dysfunctional they are. They come in here and pursue what is basically a dog whistle to parts of Australia to say, 'We don't want more foreigners coming in.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic devastation that would follow from this would be unprecedented. As we know, there are 400,000 international students studying right here in Australia. We know that they are spread throughout Australia and that they include regional universities as well. The international education sector in Australia is valued at $28 billion. Our education system is our nation's third-highest export. This is how important it is. You only have to talk to a vice chancellor or a regional vice chancellor for them to extol how important it is for their university and their ability to offer courses for Australian residents as well. It should be a source of pride and something we should be talking about in a positive light—about the benefits that this brings and the expansion that it has enabled our universities—but One Nation want to put a negative light on it. It is really disappointing that they want to talk down regional universities and Australian universities, all to have a dog whistle for their supporters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This urgency motion once again shows that One Nation simply don't understand how the economy works and the broader benefits that this brings, as I said, around construction and the spending power that these people bring to regional economies, particularly when we look at the state of Queensland. I look at examples like we have in Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton and the Sunshine Coast, which are home to universities like James Cook University, Central Queensland University and the University of the Sunshine Coast. If their foreign students numbers were to be cut, it would have a devastating impact on those local economies. James Cook University, in particular, has almost 2,000 international students studying on campuses in Townsville and Cairns. At the University of the Sunshine Coast there are 1,600 foreign students enrolled. It is estimated that the international student enrolments at the University of the Sunshine Coast inject $60 million into the local Sunshine Coast economy. These are significant numbers that have a real benefit for regional communities, particularly when you look at Townsville and Cairns. We understand that from time to time those economies do it tough. Townsville, in particular, has high unemployment at the moment. So the benefits of having those international students would be significant to boosting those local economies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also understand that there is an important role that our regional universities—particularly those in Queensland—play with our neighbouring nations such as Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. They rely on regional Queensland universities to educate their next generation of leaders. So this is providing a really vital leadership role in the Asia-Pacific region for students from other countries to come here and study, further their leadership abilities and then take that to their local communities to benefit their people as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to those links, there's the indirect benefit which our international students provide to our communities. For example, Townsville is now the beneficiary of direct international flights to Port Moresby, partially as a result of the number of Papua New Guineans studying at James Cook University. Due to James Cook University's strong links to Singapore, there is even talk that Townsville could benefit from stronger social and economic ties to Singapore. We potentially see that with the deal that the Singapore Army have done to do further training. That obviously has a direct link to Townsville, as part of that will take place there. I think this just goes to show you that, in the longer term, international education can also improve our links and relations with our regional neighbours, such as Singapore, Papua New Guinea and other important partners to Australia. These links are enhanced by international students coming to study in our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of the contribution that international education injects into our economy, the education system employs over 900,000 people, and 128,000 of those jobs are supported by the investment that is made by international students. If One Nation really cared about protecting jobs, imagine what such a stunt would do to existing employment levels at universities. If, all of a sudden, foreign students were taken out of the system, what an impact that would have! But, again, we don't see One Nation focusing in on the issues that we have seen around exploitation. We don't see any concern for the way that those workers have been treated. Instead what we see is just a scare campaign and a dog whistle. If they really cared about Australian jobs, they wouldn't be so hell bent on getting rid of an industry that provides a $28 million windfall for the economy. They would be happy to close the doors of the universities to foreign students, and that would have a devastating impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to One Nation that they really need to get an understanding of the importance of universities to Australia. Maybe they could spend some time at a regional university in Queensland so that they could learn the important role that foreign students play and the economic benefits that are brought to those regions because of this. You only have to talk to a mayor from any of those regional towns, from Cairns, Townsville or Mackay, for them to talk about the benefits of having international students, the cultural diversity it brings, the importance of the financial contribution it adds to those economies and also the growing trade links that can happen as a result. I've mentioned the benefits in Townsville. I've seen the benefits in Cairns. There are so many students who want to come and study in Cairns because it is such an attractive lifestyle there and because of its vicinity to the Great Barrier Reef as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I think what we've seen from the efforts of One Nation in this debate really is nothing more than a dog whistle from them. They will stop at nothing to target xenophobia in Australia, and the damage that it does to the economy and to regional economies is absolutely a second thought that they have no regard for.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:53</span>):  Well, I'm gobsmacked again. I cannot believe the response to this urgency motion to question jobs in Australia that international students may be taking from Australians. I won't deny international students bring a lot of income—actually the third-highest income into Australia, by all means. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection granted 343,035 international student visas in 2016-17, and these visa types are growing at a rate of 10 per cent a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say, in relation to a lot of these universities in Melbourne and Sydney, that I was at a meeting just recently and a student from down in Melbourne got up and was talking to me and she was actually crying. She said, 'I feel like a foreigner in my own university.' That's what she said, with no prompting—nothing. She wasn't the only one; another one said that to me. So this is actually how they're feeling in their own universities; they're feeling like foreigners in their own universities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The vast majority of these international student visas have a work right of up to 40 hours a fortnight during the term and unlimited work rights at other times. Let me repeat that: unlimited work rights at other times. When they get the visas to come into the country they should prove that they are self-funding—that they really don't need to work. And it's true: we estimate that about 30 to 50 per cent of the international students with a work right do work. But it's ridiculous that no-one in government knows which students work, how much they work, where they work or whether they report their earnings to the ATO. So are we getting tax from them? Who knows? We don't know that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are saying is that at the point in time they are granted visas to Australia, those foreign students should be applying and getting a TFN so that when they go to work we know what income they're making and that they pay taxes in this country. The whole fact is that if we have changed to having backpackers pay tax from the first dollar they earn, and at 15 per cent, why shouldn't international students do exactly the same thing instead of just being out there taking the jobs? This is the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These questions could be answered if the government routinely linked administrative data and cross-matched it with census data. We know from a study published this year, based on the 2011 census, that international students are employed predominantly in 10 occupations: hospitality; cleaners and laundry workers; sales assistants; food preparation assistants; food trade workers; personal carers; checkout operators; tertiary education teachers; automobile, bus and rail drivers; and packers and product assemblers. They don't need education; there are a lot of people out there who can do those jobs. These occupations are predominantly lower-skill jobs which could be done by Australians—in particular, by young unemployed Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Listen to the Labor Party, who is supposed to be for the worker. Yes, they parade their unions around and say that the unions are fighting for the rights of the workers and all the rest of it, but what about the rights of the youth and unemployed? What about them? Why aren't they addressing that? It is One Nation with an apprenticeship policy: in the first year the government pays 75 per cent of the wage, in the second year it pays 50 per cent of the wage and in the third year it pays 25 per cent of the wage. Let's get apprenticeship schemes going in this country.</span>

                  </a>  What have you done about it? Absolutely nothing! Let me tell you about some of the youth unemployment rates in these areas. Youth unemployment was a big problem in the year ending August 2017. In the 15 to 24 age group, 35 per cent are unemployed in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Chisholm talked about James Cook University in North Queensland. In Townsville there is a 46.4 per cent unemployment rate for those aged between 15 and 24. Let's go to the Sunshine Coast: 37.1 per cent. In Brisbane, we're looking at an average of 43 to 45 per cent. These are people who are looking for jobs. These are our kids, Australian kids. They can't get jobs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You're more concerned about international students. I'm not knocking them coming here; yes, it makes us a lot of money. But why don't you get out and look at what they're doing in this country by us giving them work visas? They should be supporting themselves. If we talk about housing: international students can buy established housing. But the fact is that their parents buy the houses for them, so the parents own them. They are supposed to sell that house before they leave the country. They don't; they actually then have a house in Australia. So therefore we've got another market out there. They're paying all the rent, are they? Well, a lot of them are actually in houses bought by their parents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole thing is that it needs to be looked at. Are they paying taxes in Australia? How many jobs do they actually have? A lot of it is under the counter; they're being paid cash in hand. We need to look at this with international students. My concern is for Australia and Australian kids. They are who I am concerned about. They are who should be getting these jobs. As I said, 343,035 international student visas were allocated in 2016-17. That is in one year. How many foreign students do we have in this country now? Can anyone tell me? Is it up to a million students? How many jobs are they taking? No wonder we've go so much unemployment, underemployment and casualisation of jobs in this country. Where are the unions speaking up about this?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen both sides of politics in here. This has been escalating the problems. Rural and regional areas are dying because kids are leaving the towns because they do not have jobs. And you are not doing anything about it! All I see in here are people who are hypocrites. Because we are doing something about this, all you can do is direct your fingers and say that raising this issue is about racism. Well, I can tell you that One Nation is a party that is standing up for the Australian people about jobs and about people paying their taxes. I am here to represent the Australian people, first and foremost, and to worry about everyone in this country, as are my colleagues. When you get your act together and know how to run this country, we might get ourselves out of $504 billion of debt that is heading towards $600 billion. I think both the coalition and the Labor Party, while you've both been in government, have done a very good job in raising the debt of this country. It is lucky that One Nation is here because we can keep you on your toes and start really addressing the true concerns of the Australian people. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="30484" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  At the risk of commencing with a groan from some of my colleagues, I stand here today as a proud citizen of the great state of Western Australia—yes, another one. I stand humbled by the honour bestowed upon me by the State Council of the Liberal Party and the parliament of WA to represent the people of our state in this magnificent Federation. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand here as the extremely proud father of three wonderful children: Jonathan, Eleanor and Felicity—Eleanor is the one who has been making a bit of noise. Whilst nothing I do in this role reflects upon you, everything I do is through the lens of future generations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stand here, it is a privilege to fill the casual Senate vacancy left by Chris Back. I thank Chris for his years of outstanding service to the nation. I got a departing gift from Chris. In his car stereo was a Dolly Parton CD. Chris, you can claim it back at any time, particularly as my children are now requesting it on high rotation! I follow in Chris's footsteps—not so much in his musical taste—as we do share a lot in common in our areas of policy interest. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Politics is the hope for a better future for the next generation. I am profoundly and fundamentally committed to Liberal values as the best way to deliver that future. Modern Western market democracies are cleaner, more peaceful, provide greater longevity, more opportunities and greater freedoms than any other society in the history of humanity, something that is easy to forget as we confront genuine problems and challenges. In a changing world, what will give most people the chance of a good life, I believe, is that combination of classical Liberal economic principles with a strong belief in protecting the institutions and values that have underpinned our successes. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming from a farming family, it is not surprising that Liberal values found fertile ground. Farmers work hard, seek to be economically self-sufficient and see their family as their top priority. Farmers seemingly also have way too much time to think and talk about politics. The Brockman family started farming in the new colony of Western Australia in 1830 and politics was not far behind. William Locke and Anne Francis Brockman arrived in the new colony with a prefabricated house and some livestock, including three rams and 46 merino ewes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">On his death in 1872, the obituary for William Locke read:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">He was termed the Father of the Swan, and was distinguished as being one of the most energetic, persevering, and active of settlers. He took a lead in agricultural and pastoral interests. While many of the early settlers were discussing and talking about the capabilities of the soil, and the products most likely to succeed, he was actively engaged in testing them; and was, we believe, the first person in the colony to sow wheat.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">William Locke also sat in the first parliament of Western Australia. One of William and Anne's 10 children went south to Pemberton, tall timber country, to carve out a farm for himself. This became Warren House on the banks of the Warren River, which remains in our family to this day.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Farming and politics get into the blood. I learned my politics around the kitchen table. My father and mother instilled in me values and principles that were inherently Liberal—individual responsibility, respect for others, self-reliance, family. People from the bush tend to be conservative but they are not frightened of change. On the Brockman farm in Pemberton, my family have raised horses for the British Army, cattle for meat and dairy, sheep for prime lamb and wool, cropping and horticulture. Farmers believe in keeping what works and moving on when it ceases to. This approach breeds self-reliance and an enduring commitment to the family as the central institution of life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The most profound influence on me was, without doubt, my father, also a William Locke. Dad was a political tragic. He saw politics as the venue where the contest of ideas could profoundly affect people's lives for good and bad. Dad's life bore witness to massive change in society. Dad rode a horse to school. His father, my grandfather, died when he was young. Dad took over the farm with the help of family at a young age. As a young man, Dad was mustering cattle on the large coastal leases that stretched from the farm to the ocean, living out of a saddlebag and camping rough with Aboriginal stockmen. Life was tough at times. With the end of the 99-year coastal leases in the 1960s, the original Brockman freehold looked very small by comparison; what was farmed had to change and did. Dad and Mum hung on to the farm through sheer hard work, sacrifice and willpower. Following Dad's serious illness in the 1970s, they moved to Perth to start their own businesses and to educate their four children, but the farm stayed in the family and was always home.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My enduring memory of my father is of him teaching me practical skills at the farm, telling stories and talking on the phone. Dad could easily talk for an hour or more then deny emphatically that he had been on the call for any more than 15 minutes. The first and last 10 minutes were business. But the bit in between was invariably politics and farming. Dad was not uncritical in his political assessments, but when he had finished castigating the Liberal Party for some error he would invariably go on to say why the other side was so much worse. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Dad ran for state parliament in the 1960s in what was then a safe Labor seat. A growing family and the demands of business meant he did not put his hand up again. I think it was one of his big regrets. But I often think of the last line of 'Clancy of the Overflow' when I think of Dad—'But I doubt he'd suit the office, Clancy of the Overflow.' I do wonder, if he'd made it to parliament, whether or not he would have got fed up with the whole process. Unfortunately, we never got to know. Mum was as engaged in politics though perhaps not quite the tragic Dad was.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My mum, Susan, who is with us today, was the other anchor in our lives. Mum was always very independent and in control. Whilst I would not dare to mention her age, of course, Mum continues to work today. Mum was always very strongly focused on the importance of education and particularly reading. My sisters Chris and Kate, my brother, Russell, and I all have a love of stories and the telling of tales, a gift from Mum and Dad. Growing up between the farm and our bush block in Perth, my siblings and I had a rich and varied upbringing. We were able to get dirty, ride motorbikes, shoot, fish but also get access to high-quality education and university, something not all country kids have. It was a wonderful family life we all shared. To Mum, Chris, Kate and Russ and, of course, Dad, I cannot thank you enough for all that you have done for me over the years. Without you, I could not and would not be here today.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My political philosophy has been directly shaped by my rural experiences. My family were fine wool producers in 1991 when the reserve price scheme collapsed, leaving a wool stockpile, depressed prices for years and driving producers out of the industry. Australia once rode on the sheep's back. The reserve price scheme was terrible policy that nearly killed off a wonderful industry. I was 21 at the time, living down on the farm off and on since graduating high school. I directly experienced the negative impact on our farm business.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, though, the temptation to interfere with markets, to try to control prices and to see agriculture as somehow different or special, has led what is a great industry down rabbit holes again and again. I was able to see this again firsthand when I became policy director at the Pastoralists and Graziers Association, fighting for deregulation of the wheat industry. The PGA grains committee was a lone voice who argued that Australia should no longer have a legislated export monopoly for wheat. The grains committee, under the remarkable leadership of the late Leon Bradley, brought an end to that monopoly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to dwell for a moment upon Leon. He was one out of the box: a profound thinker, a clever user of the media, a wonderful balance of pragmatic politics and philosophical consistency. Agriculture lost one of its great unsung heroes when he passed away earlier this year. Leon was a mentor and a good friend, and he is missed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Pastoralists and Graziers is full of highly professional, dedicated, successful people. With Leon Bradley, Gary McGill and Rick Wilson, I first encountered this place, walking the halls, occasionally getting lost, talking industry reform and meeting everyone from John Howard to Kevin Rudd. I grew to appreciate the science, art and occasional brutality of politics. We achieved what we set out to achieve: the deregulation of the wheat industry. The 'wheat for weapons' scandal allowed AWB's monopoly to be challenged and eventually ended. However, it also damaged the reputation of what was a profoundly good government and a great prime minister in John Howard. It also allowed a relatively unknown opposition MP from Queensland, who was apparently 'here to help', to rise to prominence. These are the slings and arrows of political fortune.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I join in the parliament my good friend in the deregulation trenches Rick Wilson, the member for O'Connor. I have been privileged to be part of Rick's long journey to parliament and he a part of mine. Working at the senior level in the O'Connor division for a decade also put me into contact with a number of people who have become good friends: Tom and Victoria Brown, Dom and Evette Della Vedova, Alana Lacy, and Steve and Deb Martin and Kate Wilson. Steve and Alana—and Alana is here today—in particular have been instrumental in helping me to reach this point, and I am eternally grateful for your ongoing friendship and support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the PGA and the O'Connor division were my apprenticeship in politics, my masterclass came from my good friend Mathias Cormann. It is hard to believe today, but, back when I started with Mathias, he was a humble backbencher—or so he said, anyway! I was never entirely convinced by the 'humble' bit. I thought I would stay for a couple of years, but Mathias was soon shadow parliamentary secretary, then a shadow minister and then finance minister. And in the blink of an eye seven years passed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Mathias gave me the best piece of advice that anyone ever has, and I'm pretty sure it was on my first day working for him. He said: 'Make sure you talk to the Parliamentary Library a lot. They are very good.' I took that advice on board. One particularly stressful day in the office, internal mail arrived from the library with a briefing note—and a chocolate frog. Now, Mathias had a habit of glancing through the mail tray when coming back to the office. He walked in and dropped it on my desk with a smile and the words, 'Slade, is there anything I should know?' Well, Mathias was prescient, as the person who sent the frog was later to become my wife—but more on Rebecca later.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Mathias has had a very loyal and hardworking team around him. I wish to acknowledge Natasha Lobo and Sue Chown, who made my role in Mathias's office so much easier. I also worked with outstanding electorate staff Micheal Prosser, Cam Sinclair, Josh Dolgoy, Mat French and Stephanie Munro. In government I had the privilege of working with many remarkable people. I would like to acknowledge in particular Belinda Pola, Mathias's current chief of staff, Simon Atkinson and Philippa Campbell. I give my profound thanks for the opportunity Mathias gave me back in 2008 and for his ongoing support and friendship since.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming to Canberra on a regular basis from WA was made so much easier by the presence of Dad's two sisters, Julia and Ann, and his brother, David. And Julia and Ann are here today. It was an absolute pleasure being able to spend time with them and my cousins, who were sometimes in and about Canberra over those years, some of whom it is also lovely to see here today. As my travel to Canberra started soon after my father's death, it was also a wonderful opportunity to connect to those three people who had shared so much with Dad, good and bad, growing up together on the farm in Pemberton.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In Canberra for this new career I join a strong Senate team from WA, all of whom I know and respect. Michaelia Cash, Dean Smith and Linda Reynolds are remarkable individuals who bring different skills and life experiences to their roles. I thank you all for your ongoing kindness and friendship as I find my new feet. I also thank my lower house colleagues from WA, some of whom have ventured over to this place today. I have been warmly welcomed to this place by all senators, and I wish to particularly thank the other recent arrivals, who have made me feel very much at home.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In preparing for today, it is unsurprising that I return to the words of our party's founder. Robert Menzies was not one to mince words. In the famous 'Forgotten People' speech, he said:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The great vice of democracy … is that for a generation we have been busy getting ourselves on to the list of beneficiaries and removing ourselves from the list of contributors, as if somewhere there was … somebody else's effort on which we could thrive.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It remains democracy's great vice, and it has been going on for much more than a generation. However, it should never be forgotten that Menzies's vision of what it meant to thrive went far beyond the mere accumulation of wealth. He also said:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A man may be a tough, concentrated, successful money-maker and never contribute to his country anything more than a horrible example.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We advocate for small, less-intrusive government, free markets and free individuals not merely to facilitate the accumulation of wealth but because a free, open, prosperous society allows people to improve their lot in life, to enjoy the beauty that this world has to offer in so many ways and to craft a better world for their families and their children. Life for the vast majority of human beings that have lived on this planet was nasty, brutish and short. What was the income gap when one absolute monarch or dictator controlled everything in society? What was the measure of social mobility if you were a subsistence farmer toiling just to keep your family from starvation? If we neglect the source of our improvement in humanity's lot—economic growth, technological development, a belief in individuals and family, innovation and enterprise—then we will be doomed to live poorer, shorter, dirtier lives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I come to this place with a background that has encompassed business, industry associations and politics. But if I can say now what I would like to achieve in this place, it is to gaze beyond population centres and look to the regions. A policy area I would like to actively pursue is to look at new ways of driving private sector investment into the regions. Leveraging limited government funds to bring private equity will become even more essential as costs increase. We need the billions of dollars in Australian superannuation accounts to look beyond the cities and invest in rural and regional opportunities. Cutting-edge farming enterprises, like those of Brad Jones from Tammin, bring the best of technology to improving productivity and expanding opportunities. Brad is, amongst many other things, developing precision seeding technology that is being looked at by international industry giants. I met Brad as one of the board members of Australian Grains Champion. The regions are full of people like Brad doing remarkable things. Government must not crush this enterprise but remove barriers to innovation and provide fundamental infrastructure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We often hear about roads and dams. I think the area that holds most businesses back in the bush is telecommunications. Good mobile and internet access, in particular, is a necessity if rural and regional businesses are to maximise their potential. In a rapidly changing world, it is not enough that we employ the biggest and best equipment. Our farmers must have access to the agricultural revolution fuelled by biotechnology. GM technology has been demonised by some as dangerous and unproven. Yet GM crops have been demonstrated to be safe for human consumption and good for the environment. Australia can and should lead the world in this field. We have the expertise. We have the funding. We must bend our collective will to ensure the fear campaign is not allowed to overwhelm the possibilities inherent in this technology.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Parliamentarians should act upon evidence and be willing to change their minds in the face of good evidence. However, we must always remember that not all evidence is good. If a study cannot be repeated, it cannot be trusted. I would like to see a percentage of research dollars across all fields spent on reproducing existing studies, with a focus on areas where such studies are driving public expenditure. Scientists in all fields would welcome such an approach, because we should never do experiments merely to publish a paper. We must do experiments to get somewhere closer to the truth. Only if studies can be and are reproduced can they ever take us further along that road.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Good governments—good parliaments—tackle hard issues. GST-sharing arrangements are one such issue. The Productivity Commission's draft report into the GST found that the current system of horizontal fiscal equalisation is holding our economy back. We need to encourage all states to develop their natural resources and we must embrace competitive federalism rather than rewarding underperformance. In light of this report, everyone in this place and in all state governments must now look seriously at how we can make sensible changes that address the gross anomalies in the system. WA was the canary in the coalmine. It took our GST share dropping towards 30c to reveal the flaws in the system. But every Australian is suffering if we are not maximising the economic development of our nation. I congratulate my colleagues who advocated for the review, and I thank Treasurer Morrison for undertaking it. Clearly, there's much more to be done, and I commit to working with all my colleagues to help find a workable solution in the best interests of WA and the nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As a party that wants to win and hold government to advance Liberal values, there will always be disappointments. We cannot win every battle we fight. But at our core we know what good governments, like those of Menzies and Howard, can deliver for Australia. I am proud to be a small part of another good government under Prime Minister Turnbull, delivering for all Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We are all here thanks to the work of so many. I have already mentioned some throughout my speech, but I cannot leave here today without singling out a few others. This is not an exhaustive list, but as your patience is not limitless, I will apologise to the many friends and supporters whom I will not name but who are also very deserving of my heartfelt thanks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party is blessed with many tireless workers, but none more so than our senior vice president, Fay Duda, who has provided wise counsel to me over many years. I also acknowledge and thank my good friends on the state executive: Anthony Spagnolo, Chris Tan, Aiden Depiazzi, Liam Staltari, Victoria Jackson, Mihael McCoy and Phil Turtle. I thank the recently-appointed state director, Sam Calabrese, for his ongoing support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To my state colleagues, including Mike Nathan, Lisa Harvey, Peter Collier, Nick Goiran and all the team: I thank you for continuing to fight the good fight from opposition. I make special mention of Jim Chown, who got me involved on the O'Connor executive, and Peter Katsambanis, who was unfailing in his encouragement of me to seek a Senate position. To my staff Grace Tan, Sonya Shanahan, Maddi White, Jess Wright and Michael Heydon: thanks in advance. You will earn those thanks as we learn when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To Rebecca's family: thank you for the support you give to her and to our children. It is wonderful that Rolanda, Rebecca's mum, her sister-in-law, Jeanette, and Leah and Eli are here today. To John, Brett and Will, and Esther, Nathan and Elsie: we wish you were here and look forward to catching up soon.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To my friends outside of politics, Peta, Kylie, Seth, Tanya, Craig, Adrian, Emily, Matt, Lucy, Aaron, Nic, Dom and Peter: thank you for you friendship over many years. I was recently reminded that we lost one of our good high-school friends, Jeff Green, almost 30 years ago to the day. It is a sobering reminder of the preciousness of friendship and the fragility of life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I also acknowledge the service of Scott Ludlam, who was also a friend from high school. I thought I might one day have served in the Senate with Scott, albeit on different sides of the chamber. I wish you well, Scott, whatever your future holds.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the many wonderful staff in parliament, who are unfailingly courteous, competent and dedicated. My son Jonathan was visiting the roof one frosty Canberra day when he decided that throwing his beanie over the wall onto the skylight of the Senate was a fun game. Later that day I happened to be chatting to a guard about what had happened and his immediate response was, 'I'll see what I can do.' He later returned the beanie to me. He made one little boy very happy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As you can see, this building holds special memories for me. As hinted at earlier, it was in this building that I met my wife, a senior researcher at the Parliamentary Library. I think I can safely say that no politician or staffer has gained more intelligence or wisdom from the Parliamentary Library than I have! And, luckily, she was born in WA!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Rebecca, we both know that this is a job that does demand more than most from our family. The absences are long, I can occasionally be a little distracted and my phone seems to become an extension of my arm. But this is a road we travel together, you and I, with Jonathan, Eleanor and Felicity. The contribution you make to our children's lives will outstrip in importance anything I achieve in this place. I thank you for all that you have done, all that you will do. When I am away, I carry your heart with me. To Jonathan, Eleanor and Felicity, my wonderful children, I promise that the moon ants will keep having adventures in Canberra for as long as Dad does, or until you get sick of those stories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, it is an honour to serve the people of Australia in the Senate. The future of our nation is as bright as the faces of all those children up in the gallery today, full of opportunities and promise. The problems and challenges that we confront can and will be overcome. Australia is a truly special nation, and we must nurture those values—of enterprise, reward for effort, family and freedom—that make it great. Thank you.</span>

In this context the committee noted that the document is a report that was prepared for the purposes of advising the Parliament as to whether there was a reasonable basis to consider requesting the Governor-General to remove a now former Vice President of the Fair Work Commission from his position. Ms Carrigan's formal complaint about the Vice President's behaviour was considered in the report that was prepared for the purposes of transacting the business of the Senate. It was tabled in the Senate and therefore is part of the Senate's proceedings. In this instance the committee has agreed that Privilege Resolution 5 applies and </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Value of a justice reinvestment approach to criminal justice in Australia,</span> provides a valuable summary of the methodology and objectives of justice reinvestment, and its possible application in Australia, by highlighting opportunities and challenges. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Justice reinvestment is fundamentally about diverting funding from the corrections system into community-based crime prevention and community strengthening programs. It is an approach that saves government spending on corrections and related criminal justice measures and reinvests those savings into the community to improve public safety. The Commonwealth Government cannot effectively fund justice reinvestment projects because state and territory governments are solely responsible for managing corrections systems in Australia and are largely responsible for corrections budgets, with the exception of a small percentage of funding for federal offenders. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The elements that make up the criminal justice system, including prisons and in-prison rehabilitation services, are generally the responsibility of state and territory governments. Furthermore, the majority of offenders in the criminal justice system have committed offences under state and territory laws. As identified in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Minority report by Coalition Senators</span>, the success of justice reinvestment therefore ultimately rests with the states and territories. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The role of the Commonwealth Government is to support the states and territories to implement a justice reinvestment approach to funding programs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Government's role also includes funding prevention programs to improve community safety, recognising that improvements in this area support a reduction in crime and may result in fewer people in prison. Examples of such programs include those under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Proceeds of Crime Act 2002</span>, which allocates assets confiscated from criminals to crime prevention projects that will benefit the community, including security infrastructure and early intervention and diversion projects. The Commonwealth Government also provides funding for a range of activities to improve community safety for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians through the Indigenous Advancement Strategy (IAS). </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On 28 July 2016 the Commonwealth Government announced the Royal Commission into the Detention of Children in the Northern Territory.

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to free and fair trade. Protectionist policies will not solve the problem of slow-growing economies throughout the world. More globalised trade provides very real benefits for Australian businesses and consumers, such as greater access to materials for manufacturing and decreased prices for goods, to name just two.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, dumping and foreign government subsidisation of goods exported to Australia is not genuine competition and can distort markets and injure Australian manufacturers. Our anti-dumping system allows Australian manufacturing businesses to compete on a level playing field against imported goods, by imposing duties on those goods in proven cases of dumping or subsidisation. A robust and effective anti-dumping system is an essential part of the Government's commitment to free and fair trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since 2013, more than 93 new anti‑dumping or subsidy investigations have been initiated by the Anti-Dumping Commission, and there are currently more than 75 final measures in place on dumped or subsidised goods exported to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's anti-dumping system is composed of a number of interlinked processes, all of which need to operate effectively to ensure the system's ongoing effectiveness. The amendment that I am introducing today is designed to address an unintended consequence generated in one of these processes, known as 'reviews of measures'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">After anti-dumping duties have been in place for 12 months, affected parties can apply for a review of measures. The purpose of the review is to ensure that the rate of the duty is contemporaneous. The new duty rate is calculated by, amongst other things, examining the price the foreign exporter sells the goods for in their home market, and the price at which they export the goods to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Reviews allow anti-dumping duties to keep in step with changes in exporter's commercial behaviour. If the exporter continues to dump, the duty rate can stay the same or increase. If the exporter has stopped or reduced their rate of dumping, the duty rate can decrease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, there exists the possibility that foreign exporters subject to duties can subvert the reviews of measures process to undermine the remedial effect of Australia's anti-dumping system. Foreign exporters are able to deliberately limit exports of the dutiable goods for a period of time in order to obtain a more favourable rate of duty for future exports. This facilitates the opportunity for the exporter to resume dumping and continue to injure Australian industry.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">To address this behaviour, which is clearly against the intent of Australia's anti‑dumping system, the Government is introducing specific methods to determine export prices for foreign exporters in reviews of measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When an exporter has made no exports during a review period, or has made a small number of exports that are not representative of commercial trade, the Anti-Dumping Commission will be able to use three specified methods to set an export price. This export price then informs the level of dumping duty that is applied to future exports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This change will increase Australian manufacturing industry's confidence in the strength of the anti-dumping system by removing an unintended consequence of reviews of measures which could be exploited by foreign exporters. This will make sure that the system continues to operate as intended to provide relief from injurious dumping for Australian manufacturers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's anti-dumping system is held in high regard by many of our trading partners, and so the Government has worked hard to ensure that this change complies with our international trade obligations, and that it will not diminish the international perception of our system's integrity and transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's anti‑dumping system is a complex space that necessitates both long-term vision as well as the ability to act rapidly when significant issues arise. The Government continually monitors the efficiency and effectiveness of the system, and remains in close consultation with Australian industry stakeholders in evaluating the need for further reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to ensuring that Australian industry can compete on a level playing field. This amendment will ensure that Australian industries continue to have access to a strong anti-dumping system that delivers efficient and effective remedies for Australian businesses injured by dumping and subsidisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend the bill to the Chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="text-align:center;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">FAIR WORK (REGISTERED ORGANISATIONS) AMENDMENT (ENSURING INTEGRITY) BILL 2017</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I move that this Bill now be read a second time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unions and employer associations have a privileged position in the workplace relations system and the economy more broadly, and their members place a great deal of trust in them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is absolutely no place for those who breach this trust and act in their own interest at the expense of members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is also no place for those who show nothing but contempt for the laws that apply equally to all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is why we committed at the last election to implement the changes in this Bill to ensure that unions, employer associations and their officials act with integrity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The changes in the Bill strengthen the grounds for the Fair Work Commission and the Federal Court to deal effectively with the financial misconduct, disregard for the law and abandonment of members that has been all too common in recent times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption identified countless examples of officials breaching their duties, engaging in blackmail, extortion, coercion and secondary boycott conduct, abusing their rights of entry, acting in contempt of court or failing to stop their organisations from repeatedly breaking the law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will restore integrity to registered organisations through four improvements to the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">First, the Bill will create a public interest test to be applied by the Fair Work Commission when unions or employer associations seek to merge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When companies seek to merge, they must first satisfy a regulator – the ACCC - such a merger won't substantially lessen competition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This competition test is like a public interest test companies seeking to merge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By comparison, unions and employer associations face no similar test. Currently, the Fair Work Commission has very limited ability to do anything other than effectively rubber stamp a merger approved by just a bare majority of members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are no general public interest considerations and there is very limited scope for affected parties to raise any concerns about a proposed merger of registered organisations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Some unions and employer groups have greater assets than many companies. Some also have a capacity to disrupt major sections of the economy. And considering their privileged position, including tax exempt status, it is especially important that they are accountable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If large, powerful unions or employer groups seek to become more powerful, with more coverage across the economy, then a public interest test should apply. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So this Bill introduces a new public interest test, which will take account of the broader impact of a proposed merger and also the record of the organisations in complying with the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Second, the Bill will strengthen the Federal Court's power to disqualify an official from standing for or holding office where they deliberately flout the law, fail to act in their members' interests, breach their duties or are otherwise found to be not fit and proper to act as officials. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also make it an offence to act as an official while disqualified. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Again, this is a sensible change, consistent with community standards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If a company director breaks the law they can be disqualified by a court from running a corporation. If a driver repeatedly breaks the road rules, they can be disqualified by a court from holding a driver's licence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A similar standard should be applied to an official from a registered organisation who repeatedly breaks the law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As recommended by the Royal Commission, the Bill also includes automatic disqualification for serious criminal offences punishable by five or more years' imprisonment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">How can anyone seriously suggest that individuals convicted of serious offences such as blackmail, extortion and threatening to cause serious harm to public officials, should be allowed to hold office in a registered organisation? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Third, the Bill strengthens the powers for the Federal Court to cancel the registration of an organisation or take appropriate action against a part of the organisation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under present rules, it is virtually impossible to deregister a union or employer organisation – even if they persistently break the law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This needs to change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will allow the Court to cancel registration where the organisation or its senior officials have repeatedly broken the law, breached their duties or failed to put their members first. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Again, this applies a consistent standard. The new grounds for cancellation are modelled on similar power relating to the winding up of companies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Where a ground for cancellation has been made out because of the conduct of officers or members of a particular branch of an organisation, the Bill will also provide for the Court to make an order specific to that particular branch, division or other part of an organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Last, the Bill strengthens the provisions providing for an organisation to be placed into administration. The current provisions offer little guidance on the circumstances in which administration is available, and do not make clear what steps the Court can take to deal with those situations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed provisions will ensure that the Court can appoint an administrator to a registered organisation or part of it when financial misconduct has occurred in an organisation, its officials have repeatedly broken the law or breached their duties or it is otherwise dysfunctional.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These provisions will deal with the problems that arose in the context of the HSU being placed into administration. That case was ultimately resolved because the parties largely agreed about the facts in issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, there were numerous court applications, which resulted in a confusing process that could have been extremely lengthy had the facts been contested. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All of these changes will help ensure that unions and employer groups focus on doing the right thing by their members and the industries they represent and ensure that when the law is broken, the court can take action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment (Ensuring Integrity) Bill 2017 will help improve and in some cases, restore, a culture of integrity to registered organisations - for the benefit of members and also the wider community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Debate adjourned.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Competition and Consumer (Industry Code—Sugar) Regulations 2017, made under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, be disallowed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight we're considering the unbalanced code of conduct covering the sugar industry. This unbalanced code was hastily prepared in response to One Nation saying that they would go on strike if such a code wasn't introduced. This threat not to vote on legislation was made back in March, when the government was seeking to legislate to lower the company tax rate, an issue of great significance to Australia. The code is also a response to the Nationals wanting to demonstrate that they can respond in knee-jerk fashion to short-sighted complaints as quickly as One Nation can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because it was hastily prepared, there was none of the usual consultation covering all the stakeholders that would be subject to the code. Because the code is so fundamental to the functioning of the industry, this is an irresponsible omission. Because the code was a response to short-sighted complaints, it is not like the codes of conduct found in other industries, which take an even-handed approach and make clear that negotiations are to be in good faith. Instead, this code tilts the scales heavily in favour of the blinkered demands of those who complain the most, to the long-term detriment of the entire sugar industry. With the Greens and some other crossbenchers willing to jump into bed with One Nation and the Nationals on this, it looks like the long-term decline in Australia's share of global sugar production is set to continue. Once again we see that the antibusiness, foreigner-fearing Greens and One Nation are more alike than either wants to admit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This code is not a balanced code of conduct, because it allows arbitration pre contract and it is proscriptive about the arbitrator's role. The code refers to 'grower economic interest sugar', which is a concept set in Queensland legislation. The code forces the arbitrator to rule that the marketing entity for this sugar must be chosen by the canegrowers. Yet this is sugar made and owned by a miller. The decisions as to how that sugar will be sold will be taken out of the hands of the miller. Forcing a miller to negotiate with an input supplier over the sale of the miller's own products and to comply with the directives of an arbitrator should it fail to agree with those input suppliers is not a formula for business confidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a pretty safe bet that there won't be a rush of additional investment in sugar mills while this code remains. That's important because our international competitiveness is already marginal. If sugar milling becomes uncompetitive through lack of investment, canegrowers will suffer as much as anyone. What growers really need is competition for their cane. They ought to be doing everything possible to attract new entrants into milling, if not investing their own money. As it stands, the only people who say the canegrowers have a legitimate claim are those who are pandering to get their vote, plus a few who don't like foreign investment and don't understand the issues. Significantly, neither the Productivity Commission nor the Queensland Productivity Commission supported this sort of government intervention, noting that it would cost money and jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It really comes down to the idea that you shouldn't control what you don't own. Once canegrowers deliver their cane to a railway siding or delivery point near their farm, it belongs to the mill, which processes it into sugar. In the past, when many sugar mills were owned by grower cooperatives, canegrowers felt they had some—albeit remote—influence over how the mill marketed its sugar. Australia has a very minor influence on world sugar prices, but growers liked the thought that they had a say. Those days are gone. Most mills now have no grower shareholders at all. However, despite having sold the cane and with no equity in either the sugar or the mill, growers are still demanding a say over who markets the sugar. Some of the owners of mills have vast access to international markets and have put real money into sugar communities. But it seems the main point people make about these owners is the complaint that they are foreigners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This disallowance motion may well be defeated, but the real losers will be future generations of Queenslanders who will continue to see their share of the global sugar market fall to countries with a more business friendly approach. I commend the motion to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WILLIAMS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:46</span>):  Senator Leyonhjelm has it very wrong here. Leaving it to the market is fine when you have a fair, competitive market. But the fact is that, when canegrowers grow their cane, they must take it as quickly as possible to the nearest processing plant—the nearest mill. They can't say, 'Oh, the price today at this mill is such and such and down the road it's a better price.' You can't take it down the road.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Early in 2014 I met with sugarcane growers at Condong, near Murwillumbah. I spoke to my colleague Queensland Nationals Senator Barry O'Sullivan—welcome to the chamber—in June, and we instigated an inquiry through the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee in June 2014. We held hearings at Murwillumbah, Mackay and Townsville. They were attended at various times by Senator O'Sullivan, Senator Canavan, Senator Macdonald, former Senator Bullock and committee chair Senator Sterle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sugarcane production contributes $2.5 billion to the Australian economy each year and is largely concentrated along Australia's eastern coastline in Queensland and New South Wales. That's where the sugar's mainly grown. Queensland has the bulk of the sugar produced by the states, at 95 per cent, and only five per cent is in New South Wales. While it is vastly different, there are some issues which are of common concern to both states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wilmar, MSF Sugar and Tully Sugar had given notice to terminate their RSS agreements with Queensland Sugar Limited in 2017. This caused great concern in the industry. As the inquiry progressed, it became clear that grower choice in relation to grower economic interest in sugar was an issue of central importance to growers and their representative bodies. Canegrowers and the Australian Cane Farm Association suggest any real choice for canegrowers would be removed if the large milling companies were to take control of the sugar marketing sector. Growers were acutely aware that they were at a disadvantage when it came to the amount of power the milling companies held at the time. The committee was told that, in fact, both sectors of the industry had been experiencing considerable difficulties in their attempts to decide on terms and reach agreements on new contracts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Burdekin District Cane Growers Limited also argued that the tension between growers and millers such as Wilmar had more to do with the imbalance of bargaining power between growers and Wilmar Sugar than it does with Wilmar Sugar being a foreign-owned company. The committee was told there was no statutory or mandatory dispute resolution process which would assist sugar industry stakeholders, both canegrowers and millers, to resolve commercial disputes. The committee observed the strong interrelationship and interdependence which exists between sugarcane growers and sugar milling companies. It was clear that neither would be able to survive without the other remaining profitable and sustainable. There was a lack of trust on the part of the canegrowers in relation to the large milling companies, particularly Wilmar. It was agreed that Wilmar needed to come to the table prepared to engage in positive negotiations with canegrowers and their representatives and that the canegrowers needed to show they were prepared to negotiate in a positive way.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time as the Senate inquiry, a task force was involved in the development of a code of conduct for the industry and there was only one recommendation, which stated:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends the development and implementation of a mandatory sugar industry code of conduct acknowledging that provide appropriate stake holder consultation is undertaking the work of the sugar marketing code of conduct task force may provide a foundation on which a code of conduct may be established.</span>

The code addresses a power imbalance between millers and growers by requiring good faith, fair and honest negotiations without intimidation.. In the case of Wilmar sugar suppliers in 2017, the code of conduct forced the miller to complete a cane supplier agreement negotiations and prevented it from continuing to hold growers to ransom head of the start of the season.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Growers need to accept the new reality of multinational companies owning Queensland sugar mills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The manager of Proserpine CANEGROWERS, Mike Porter, said in the same article that his growers get about 60 per cent of the estimated value of the cane delivered to the mill, and for Senator Leyonhjelm to say that they get 90 per cent is stretching it. Senator Leyonhjelm says that spending $400 million on the regulation of the sugar industry was a waste, but this was shot down by Mr Porter, who said that rationalisation has created a lot of efficiencies and that the Australian industry is one of the most efficient in the world, and probably the envy of most countries that grow sugar.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was Minister Barnaby Joyce who said to the sugar industry, 'Come to an agreement, get your act in order, make a decision, or we will.' He said that for months before this was released. Sure, it was backed by Senator Hanson and One Nation. We launched an inquiry in 2014, Senator O'Sullivan and I. We carried out the inquiry, along with other senators here, and we saw how the market is simply unfair in the sugar industry and how the big end of town has a monopoly and can dictate the terms to the canegrowers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, the canegrower, the primary producer, is a price taker not a price maker. Not many of you in this Senate would understand what I'm talking about, but I have lived it for most of my life. Now we have the situation where we now have surety and security and everyone is happy. As I said, Minister Joyce said to them, 'If you don't come to an agreement with the growers and companies like Wilmar, we will put a mandatory code of conduct in.' And we did. Thank you for honouring your word again, Minister Joyce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we have someone, in the form of Senator Leyonhjelm, trying to disallow this—I believe he is backed by the Labor Party and probably the Greens as well. This is scary. Why have you got such a set on primary producers? If the market were fair I would totally support this, but the market is not fair. A canegrower must take their cane to the nearest mill within hours of cutting it. There's none of this: 'What's the price at this mill today?' 'It's such and such.' 'I'll get a quote down the road; I'll take it to the mill down the road.' You can't do that, you have to run it to the nearest mill. There is no competition as far as the mill goes, so the market is failing. It is unfair, and that's why it needs a code of conduct to deliver fairness to the canegrowers. I urge senators to vote against this disallowance motion.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator O'SULLIVAN:</span>
                    </a>  Just for a moment, Senator Bernardi—I'd appreciate that. This matter has now been lingering around this place for multiple weeks. Without directing my attention to Senator Bernardi, I think there's been adequate time for any senator to explore all sides of this equation in order to make their mind up about whether they should or shouldn't support this disallowance motion. Indeed, reference to the report that Senator Williams has spoken about would have articulated it clearly. That was a massive inquiry. Senator Macdonald, who is the father of the Senate, told me he'd never been at a Senate hearing with as many stakeholders present. In Townsville there were over 350 in a massive hall. They just attended to observe the conduct of the inquiry. All the millers were there and all the growers were there. So that would have aided it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But can I say, Senator Bernardi, that the reason this motion was brought on today is that this has been continuing to cause great angst back in this industry. It has had nearly three years where people weren't able to plan. Planning around sugar is a big deal; you've got to make a decision now about a five-year business plan. So, the investment that you make this season will have impacts on your business operations for five years. After three years of uncertainty, which was stabilised with the application of the code, there was a massive sigh of relief across the canegrowers in my home state of Queensland, which is largely where the production in this country is. I know that Senator Williams has cane production in the northern part of New South Wales, but Australia's cane production is largely in the state of Queensland. There was a huge sigh of relief—and I mean from people in their thousands. I've been here nearly four years now, and I've never had so much correspondence and traffic—phone calls and contact events—made over an issue as I did over sugar. There are, on average, 4,500 families and something like 67 small communities involved, and if the sugar industry is disrupted it will disrupt their economies and their social circumstances right across my home state. They are small communities, some of them with only a couple of hundred residents. You could probably argue that this instability ran from somewhere north of the Tweed and up through Childers with a break and then through to production areas around Serena and Mackay and all the way up the coast almost all the way to Cairns. There is not one of those small coastal communities on the eastern side of the Great Divide that would not be affected by this continued instability in the sugar industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't even need to return to our contemporary inquiry to understand why this became necessary. There was a royal commission in this country in 1932, I think it was, into the sugar industry because the sugar industry was not developing. That was because of the concern about the power imbalance of millers with respect to this particular commodity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to pick up and elaborate further on a couple of points made by Senator Williams. This commodity has to be harvested in a very short period of time. It's measured in weeks. It's not as if you can just throw the crop in and say, 'I'll come back from holidays in January, and I'll take the crop off, or, if that doesn't suit me, I'll wait until Easter,' or use any of the other rotations that can occur with other commodities. Once it's harvested, its life, its productivity, is measured in hours, not even days. What happens to it is that it goes onto a little, flimsy carriage on a little, flimsy rail line, and it can only go to one place. That's the mill. It can't be stored. It's not efficient to transport it by any other method to another mill—and, even if you could, you are likely, in my home state of Queensland, to arrive at another mill owned by the same miller you were trying to avoid 60 kilometres down the road.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had some colleagues who wanted to talk to me about the free market. Well, I'm a free marketeer to a certain extent. I'm not going to make out that I'm a total free marketeer; I don't mind protected markets. But the thing you need, to be able to make decisions around a free market, is a free market, and there is no free market with respect to this sugar.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the royal commission almost a hundred years ago, 70-something years ago, decided was the principle of economic interest—so the relationship between the miller and the grower. It didn't matter that the mills were sometimes cooperatively owned by the growers. This principle of economic interest was the safeguard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, when this mob came along, of course, they made undertakings when they came through the Foreign Investment Review Board that they weren't going to disturb these marketing conditions that had prevailed and operated successfully in this space for all of this period of time. One thing I can tell you about the corporation Wilmar is that they are very persistent, and they are very patient. This won't end here today. With this episode today with Senator Leyonhjelm, I've got to imagine that they have persuaded him or convinced him of the merits of his activities here today. There can be no other reason. Senator Leyonhjelm didn't wake up one day in his apartment in Sydney and say, 'Golly gee, by the end of the day I'd better fix this business around sugarcane marketing in a state that I rarely visit.' And, of course, he won't be able to visit it any longer. He won't be able to go to any beach community between Noosa and Cairns unless he's got a wig and a moustache on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wasn't even going to speak today, but I was persuaded. I listened to this in my office. He started to make allegations in here that were not accurate. One was that the National Party somehow had some knee-jerk reaction with the code of conduct. Well, I've got to tell you: it's a pretty slowly operating knee, because it started in 2014 and it didn't come into play until any number of years later. And, on the suggestion that somehow a government in which I'm involved has done some dirty deal with any crossbenchers, such as One Nation, I know that One Nation genuinely support agriculture, growers and small farmers in my home state. You couldn't put a Tally-Ho paper between One Nation and the National Party in their attitude to small communities, agriculture and supporting these industries and these particular economies. It wouldn't matter what the circumstances were. It was of no surprise that One Nation themselves turned their attention to this particular issue with the sugar industry and joined us, in effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm happy to say we were there because our circumstances allowed. We were there well before it. We had spent, in my case, hundreds and hundreds of hours travelling in these inquiries, poring over reports, making adjustments and changes. I must have attended 25 or 30 meetings. When Senator Leyonhjelm says there was no consultation, I've got to tell you that I couldn't even go into my bathroom; representatives of Wilmar and other mills were sitting on the bench there waiting for me in my suite. So any suggestion that we didn't talk to, listen to, debate and argue with every element within industry—and I'm not just talking about canegrowers and cane processors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I travelled that country up there as many do and my colleagues here do. I've travelled it dozens of times. And this was a topic of conversation with local government, with local business associations, with everybody. So every stakeholder was consulted, and we arrived, at the end of the day, with the decision around the mandatory code. The mandatory code was mandatory as opposed to voluntary because Wilmar indicated that they wouldn't comply with a voluntary code. So it had to be made mandatory for it to have any sort of effect. I like Senator Leyonhjelm and I've got on well with him while I have been here. But—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator O'SULLIVAN:</span>
                    </a>  My apologies. I have trouble with long names. I like Senator Leyonhjelm and I've had cooperation with him since I have been here. But I will not tolerate any senator coming in here and attacking the agricultural base of these great families, 4,500 of them, who have provided enormous input to the economy of my state and the economy of this nation. These are decent family men and women. You go there; these are real family communities. These are places where the kids often work on the farm, or not far away, and there are four or five generations involved in the development of sugar. And I'll say to any senator that wants to attack it front on: I won't sleep until I defend these farmers at every level; and if I have to default, if someone has to be favoured, it will be the farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The big boys, the Wilmars, one of the biggest processors in the world, can look after themselves. I don't want to attack Wilmar. They're a company and I'm always very cautious in this place not to do reputational damage to corporations. But one of the telling questions was that Wilmar wanted to enter the marketplace and have the right to sell the sugar of these growers—and they have been granted that right. The old single desk that was around, QSL, was expanded. So Wilmar can, if they choose, entice the growers to allow them to market their sugar, to pick up this other premium that they think is there to be had. But why don't the sugar growers use them? Because there's been a complete and absolute collapse of trust in Wilmar over the last three or four years as these dealings evolved. They don't trust them. They understand that, if they go off there for a fortnight, it's like having a new girlfriend and leaving the wife at home. If QSL is not there, at the end of the day we do have a single desk, a Wilmar desk, controlling the ports and the logistics—and that's when you know you've got trouble. That's when you've got 'farm gate'. That's when you have those little railway lines that go off to the mill and come back still full of cane.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we will be vigilant on this while ever we're in power. I really appreciate the support of One Nation. I have to correct my colleague, Senator Williams. I think he was a bit hasty in jumping on the Greens. I don't know what the Greens will do with this vote. But there was an indication earlier today when they supported bringing this on and restoring stability into the sugar industry for sugar growers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to close by saying this. My message to Wilmar is: look straight down the barrel. You're not the only one that's patient. You're not the only one that knows how to exercise power. It's a long way between now and when you cripple our sugar industry. It's a long way between now and when you get sole power over this important industry. The message to you is clear: it won't matter whether I'm here, whether Senator Hanson and her colleagues are here or whether Senator Williams is here, our side of politics will continue to protect the interests and integrity of industries that are so important to so many thousands of our families, so many hundreds of our communities, from now until the end of time. So, Wilmar, if you don't like those circumstances, pack your bags and go to Brazil or somewhere else.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  My grandmother would have described the situation with this sugar code as a butty mess. The whole drafting, implementation and now potential disallowance of this code has been mired in party politics. It's been the party politics of the Nationals versus One Nation versus doing deals to stop George Christensen crossing the floor in the other place. It has been a mess. But the people that have been hung out to dry during this mess are the farmers. They are the ones that have been used as political pawns in this political game playing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Greens, we have approached this by saying: 'Look, we don't want to get involved with the murky, messy politics of the Nationals and the Liberals and George Christensen and One Nation in Queensland. That's not what we want to be engaged with.' I understand the Labor Party have basically decided to support this disallowance because they knew that if this code was disallowed all that politics would flare up again and they would be poking the beehive and causing chaos, and that's what they wanted to do. But we decided, 'Look, let's just look at this from a very policy-focused point of view as to what is right.' We decided to go back to Greens principles. And this is a matter of fairness. It is about sugarcane growers versus the predatory behaviours of large, monopolistic corporations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, this code of conduct isn't perfect. Yes, it was developed, as I said, in that murky mire of politics. Yes, it was developed without a regulatory impact statement. It could have been done a lot better. But, ultimately, having this code with its flaws is much better than having no code at all. So the Greens will not be supporting Senator Leyonhjelm's disallowance of this code tonight, because we are standing up for farmers, against the predatory behaviours of those multinational corporations who, if this code was disallowed and no longer existed, would be able to keep on screwing down the screws and hanging cane growers out to dry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Basically, this code is making sure that farmers have access to some protection, protection that they need in order to deal with their local monopolist. It is clear that if this disallowance got up—if we did not have a code of conduct—sugar millers would be able to further abuse their market power. They would be able to do things like pushing Australian cane growers to accept their terms on supply agreements, on marketing choice and on a host of other contractual matters. The code addresses the serious, perverse incentives that otherwise apply for millers to be able to maximise their margins at the expense of growers, which is what monopolies are able to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is effectively a monopoly situation. If you're a cane grower, you don't have a choice as to who you are going to sell your sugar to. There is a massive market imbalance, and that's where you need governments to step in. You need governments to regulate, to level the playing field and give some power back to the growers who otherwise wouldn't have any. There is a very large market imbalance; without this code, sugar millers are able to continue negotiating right up to the day of harvest, knowing that unless a supply agreement is struck the cane growers are legally unable to sell their cane, because a supply agreement has to be in place for the sale to be legal. So there are very strong and necessary reasons that you have a code in place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this code is far from perfect, but it's what we've got. It was introduced without the usual regulatory processes being followed. It was introduced without a regulatory impact statement; there was no formal industry consultation, and it was introduced with a speed that was set not by good process and good governance but by political necessity. That is not good policy practice. But it's here and it's better than nothing. So the Greens want to see this code continue to be in place. There is a review process that's going to occur over the next 12 months. We look forward to that review process and to being able to improve the code. We look forward to the consultation process that will occur as part of that review process, so that we can make sure that all sections of the industry, particularly the canegrowers, are able to get a good outcome that is in the interests of Australia overall.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:15</span>):  Labor is not opposed to a mandatory code, but the current code of conduct is nothing more than a political fix. It was imposed on our sugar industry against their will. There was barely any consultation or assessment of the potential impacts on investment and jobs in the industry. We need to make sure that we get the balance right, bridge the disparity between canegrowers and millers and make sure that no single stakeholder has more power than the other. Any sugar code of conduct must ensure that canegrowers are confident that their livelihoods will be supported by the industry at large, that millers and other industry stakeholders have the capacity to better promote their products, and that there is greater competition in the industry. In particular, we need to ensure that millers are also working in the interest of hardworking canegrowers—the people who actually grow the product that they refine for sale to the rest of the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes that there is a case for a properly and responsibly developed code of conduct which addresses any of the market power imbalances between canegrowers and millers. The re-regulation of Queensland's sugar industry in December 2015 enables sugar canegrowers to direct how millers market sugar internationally. While canegrowers in Queensland were happy to see the changes go through, it looks like further issues have arisen since the re-regulation of the industry. Re-regulation of the sugar industry has restricted competition in the industry, reduced investment in milling capacity and reduced the incentive to promote further innovation in the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is part of a global economy, and our canegrowers are in the situation where they have to compete with other canegrowers from around the world, most notably from Brazil. We need to ensure that our canegrowers, millers and the industry as a whole are able to compete against countries like Brazil. In order for that to happen we need to make sure that the power imbalance between our canegrowers and millers is addressed. The current code of conduct does almost nothing to address this imbalance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports further consultation and consideration of the implications that regulation would have on the sugar industry. Until adequate consultation is had and the views of various stakeholders are heard, we believe that the current code is not good enough and should be ripped up.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="BK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  It's quite interesting to hear Labor's comments about the code of conduct—that it's not drafted very well and it's not good, so we'll allow the disallowance motion by Senator Leyonhjelm. The fact is that it was Labor's policy under Wayne Swan that allowed Wilmar, a multinational company, to buy in Australia and buy the mills in north Queensland. Because of that, at that time, a five-year agreement was drawn up where they had to deal with the canegrowers through Queensland Sugar Ltd as well. The canegrowers sell their cane to the mill—it's called a cane supply agreement—and then it is marketed. It was marketed by QSL, who had been doing it for many, many years. The canegrowers got a fair deal because it was set up by the canegrowers originally—a non-profit organisation. But, after the five years, Wilmar said, 'Hang on a minute, we want to take your cane, but we want to market it as well.' It did not give the canegrowers an option about who markets their sugar. There was no option where QSL could market it. Wilmar said, 'We're going to crush your sugar, and we want to mill it as well.' Wilmar, as I've been told, hasn't got a great reputation for selling their product to countries overseas because their quality is not up to standard. QSL has a very, very high reputation with overseas countries and buying Australian sugar.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hence, why haven't all these sugarcane growers signed up with Wilmar? They were put on the spot. Months and months and months went by. Nothing was done about it, because they didn't trust Wilmar, until they got to the very end. They were forced, and they only had a matter of weeks to go. They had to sign the contract. Why the code of conduct? Because they had to start cutting their cane within a matter of weeks. They needed the code of conduct so then they could determine who would market their sugar.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why did One Nation get involved? It is because they were hitting their heads up against a brick wall. The growers could not get anyone to listen to them about the situation they were in. And, because the deals were not done and they were not signed up to a cane supply agreement, the whole area lost. A matter of $150 million was taken out of that economy for those canegrowers. Why did One Nation take a stand on this? We abstained from voting on the floor of parliament until we actually got a code of conduct for the canegrowers, because they were on their knees. No-one was listening to them. Nothing was being done. And I'm pleased that we forced the issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to hear Senator Barry O'Sullivan. He has been involved in this in attending meetings. I attended meetings up in North Queensland myself. I spoke to the canegrowers. I don't recall ever seeing Senator Leyonhjelm, the senator for New South Wales, at any of those meetings. I have no understanding of—I am gobsmacked to understand—why Senator Leyonhjelm is actually supporting a multinational company over the canegrowers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really appreciate how the Greens are viewing this and their support on this matter, because it is all about the growers. It's all about the struggling families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I spoke to Senator Leyonhjelm about this, I said, 'Why are you doing this to the growers?' And his response was, 'Well, they can actually go and take it to another mill.' But they can't. They have to put it on the rail lines. The rail lines are owned by Wilmar. It has to go to the mill. 'Well, they can put it on trucks and ship it somewhere else.' No, you can't do that. You see, once the cane is cut, it's 12 hours; it has to get to the mill. So there's nowhere else they can take it. So the whole fact is: 'Well, tell them to get out of it. Go and do another business. Go and get out of the cane growing.' No wonder the farmers are fed up with this attitude. Some of them are saying to the kids now: 'Get off the farm. There's no future here. We don't know what's going to happen.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And here we have the Labor Party saying, 'Oh, well, it's drawn up in a hurry, so we need to really look at this before we do anything about it.' It's about time you started listening to the Australian people and what's happening to them. They are just about going under, losing their properties and everything because they can't get an agreement, didn't know whether they should cut their cane or what to do with it—and you're worried about whether a code of conduct is drawn up properly. Probably not. But—do you know what?—it's given them a grace period of approximately two, maybe three, years. It's not settled yet. And your Labor Party counterparts in Queensland haven't supported them either. I hope they realise that come the next election, when they won't get the votes from them. They won't be voting for the Labor Party. They haven't supported them at all. And I've got to say that the LNP in Queensland hasn't been much better either in supporting them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wilmar also have a 30 per cent ownership in the QSL, so I have no understanding of why they want to dictate and determine it. Talk about multinationals—and all I hear now is the Labor Party supporting multinationals. That's exactly what they're doing: supporting big business in Australia. Wilmar are a Singaporean that's come in to dictate terms. The Labor Party agreed to it, to allow them to take over a mill that controls the whole area. This is what multinationals, foreign ownership, can do in our country. We've seen it not once, not twice; we've seen it many, many times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobs—yes, we've got to protect jobs in Australia. If we see the canegrowers go under, in North Queensland or throughout the state, it will also affect the mills, and then you will have more people out of work. If you haven't got cane farming, you don't need the mills. All of North Queensland relies on the money brought in by the canegrowers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I call on the Labor Party: please consider this. Do not allow this disallowance motion to pass in this chamber today. It will affect the canegrowers again. It is under review; let's find something better; but, for the next two to three years, let's just support the system the way it is and find a better answer. Throwing these regulations out will not help the canegrowers at all. They're depending on us to make the right decisions for them in this chamber. It's all about their future. It's all about their kids. It's all about their farming, which is so important to us. I once again say thank you very much to the Greens for looking at this rationally and not supporting the disallowance motion, and I thank the Liberal and National parties also for their support of the canegrowers.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="266524" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I am against this disallowance. We acted. We listened. This action was initiated by the canegrowers. It was not initiated by a strike pulled by Senator Hanson. All we did was listen, and then all we did was take action. This issue at its core is about farmers, food production and not being heard; and it's about farmers, food producers, with little power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud of the fact that, over the last 170 years, since the Industrial Revolution—actually, over the last 250 years, thanks to the revolution in Britain and governance; actually, over the last 700 years, since the Magna Carta—we have lived in the sort of country that we live in today. Those events were due to freedom. They were due to largely free markets. At my core, I am a libertarian. I believe passionately in freedom of speech and freedom of markets. But, sadly, we do not have free markets globally. We do not have free markets in this country. I have worked and lived and studied in the United States. They do not have free markets. Increasingly, government is getting involved around the world, and it is causing problems. For those who live in cities, perhaps you can identify with another problem—the problem facing taxi drivers. We know it in Brisbane, we know it in Queensland and it's the same around the country. Taxi drivers are saddled now with expensive plates because Uber has come in with none of the burdens faced by taxi drivers. The core problem there is excessive government in the first place. While government was initially protecting some rich taxi drivers, that has turned and become government now impeding all taxi drivers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in the real world. I admire Senator Leyonhjelm's philosophy, his honesty and his integrity with his principles. However, we do not live in a free world. We live in a world that has been manipulated and distorted by governments for many, many decades. This building, in my honest opinion, has been very destructive in some of the policies and government interventions that have come out of here. At its core, I'll bet the roots of this issue go back to excessive government intervention in the first place. In the real world, this kind of world, we need to look after the basics—the basics like food production; the basics of making sure that farmers have free access and free support. Food is an issue for all city dwellers. We all eat, and food is an issue for all people who buy food. It is part of the process to produce, distribute, process, distribute and then eat food. In this process, the leach is the government, quite often.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the casualties are in the communities. When I went through Home Hill and Ayr not long ago, the number of businesses boarded up with blank windows and empty buildings was staggering. That means the community is suffering. I see initiatives in the regional towns—not far to the north, in Ingham—not being supported by the government and not being supported by the LNP in Queensland, the Labor Party in Queensland or their local members. Yet these are initiatives that regional people from Queensland are initiating which could contribute to fixing health problems around our whole country. Government is not doing its job. This industry's future depends on the process of farming, which, as Senator O'Sullivan said, can take many years to plan for and harvest to then get the rewards from the crop. It can take many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Lending to Primary Production Customers, it has become clear to me that in addition to some of the banks' behaviours, some of the receivers' behaviours and some of the other people in the chain, one other entity has been doing enormous damage, and that entity is government both state and federal. Think about this: a farmer goes and buys some land. He or she then has property rights. Those property rights are then stolen. That land is worth less as a result of government intervention—government stealing land. Today in Queensland we see farmers actually suffering a loss of property rights thanks to the current Labor government and past Labor governments. That property rights issue destroys land values, destroys farm productivity and raises costs for farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue that governments control is tax. Tax is crippling. We have taxes on payroll, of all things. We know that if we tax something we decrease its use. Why are we taxing payroll? We know that it's difficult in our country for farmers to get labour in towns with high unemployment, and that's why we need backpackers. Something is wrong. We saw in 2011 the live cattle trade completely shut down overnight. We saw cattle then being moved from the north of Western Australia all the way down into New South Wales to be sold, and the prices plummeted and communities were devastated. Farmers and families were devastated and people were suiciding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then we see government intervention in the form of water control. Some of the farmers—there are some here now—from the Burdekin have had an increase of around 300 per cent in the cost of their water in recent years. Overall, I'm told, that most farmers have faced a 50 per cent increase in their water costs. But that's not all. They say power prices have increased 110 per cent in recent years in a state where the state government wants to destroy a cheap, reliable and secure source of power and replace it with a renewable energy target of 50 per cent—and the LNP supports that by supporting the Labor budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These farmers, some of whom are here, are not wealthy. They work in delicatessens and they own delicatessens to make sure that they can get by. Some do earth moving on the side to keep them busy and to get by. They are stressed. It doesn't matter whether they're cotton farmers from Mondure, or cattle men or what: these days they face international markets and they have to be very much on top of the science, to be au fait with the economics and to be lawyers—because they're taken to court or they have a state government stealing property rights. So they need to be experts in everything, and that's not fair. We pay for it throughout the country. We have the best farmers in the world—from the dry south-west right through to the tropical Cape York. We have the best farmers in the world, but they're challenged by overseas subsidies paid by foreign governments. Their challenged by overseas companies coming in here. They're challenged by our own government policies and regulations destroying businesses, making it difficult even to live. There are tax, energy costs, property rights and—there it is again—government. Government needs to get out. But in this case we have an imbalance of power—a huge imbalance of power. We have a $7 million company versus a $40 billion corporation who has legal power, market power and staying power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about trust, as Senator Hanson so wisely said. This is about making sure Australians have a fair go, because under tax regimes in this country foreign companies quite often don't pay any company tax. That puts them at a 30 per cent advantage straight away. This is not a simple little issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are against this disallowance. Our responsibility in One Nation is to listen, to ask questions, to listen, to take action, to listen, to serve and to be accountable, and we are willing to be accountable to the canegrowers of Queensland. We're willing to check ourselves and we want to restore our Constitution. We congratulate the canefarmers and we congratulate Senator Hanson for taking her action. This is a matter of trust, and we will not be supporting this disallowance.</span>

The coalition government delivered a mandatory sugar code of conduct to support dealing with sugar mills in time for the June 2017 crush. The coalition government introduced a code following a listening tour of growers in North Queensland to assist growers, mills and marketers dealing with disputes. The code came into immediate effect in April following months of protracted negotiations between growers, mills and sugar marketers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The context of this motion is that in August this year two councils in the Melbourne area, the Yarra City Council and the Darebin City Council, voted to no longer refer to 26 January as Australia Day and to no longer hold citizenship ceremonies on that date. The councils also made comment about the inappropriateness of having 26 January as the day that we celebrate Australia Day because of the hurt that it causes to so many of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In taking these steps, the Darebin and Yarra councils have shown courage and leadership, and they've stood with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the many, many other Australians, including all of the Australian Greens senators in this place, who believe that it's not appropriate to celebrate Australia Day on 26 January. The Australian Greens strongly support the actions that both the Yarra and Darebin city councils took and their decision to no longer hold citizenship ceremonies on that date. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once they had made those decisions, they were come down on like a tonne of bricks by the government, and, after some completely overblown rhetoric from the relevant junior minister, Mr Hawke, with regard to this matter, we saw an instrument tabled in the Commonwealth parliament that sought to remove the authority of the Yarra City Council and the Darebin City Council from holding any citizenship ceremonies whatsoever. I mean, talk about trying to crack a walnut with a sledgehammer! We oughtn't be surprised that that was the response from Mr Hawke, acting, no doubt, on the instructions of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Mr Dutton. The first thing that we need to say very clearly here—</span>

                    </a>  Senator Seselja can mutter away all he likes like Bill the Steam Shovel over there, but he can have his say later if he wants to. What's important to acknowledge is that the conversation about changing the date of Australia Day is happening around the country and it's happening at a higher volume every year. I remember when I had the honour to be invited and attended the first walk in Hobart on Invasion Day many years ago. I reckon we would have been lucky to have 50 people there. When I went to the walk this year in Hobart, we had well over a thousand people walking through the streets of Hobart demanding that Australia Day not be celebrated on 26 January. We have a fundamental respect for the original peoples of this country and we don't believe it's appropriate to celebrate our national day on a day that was the start of so much hurt and so much dispossession for those people. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Good local governments reflect their communities, and good local governments want to be as welcoming and as inclusive as possible. So, to what we believe was a sensitive and sensible step taken by the Yarra City Council and Darebin City Council, the Liberals responded, as I said, with a typically heavy-handed approach. Make no mistake: the government's response to the decisions made by these two councils, decisions that were based on goodwill and bringing our community together, has been vindictive and mendacious. Firstly its response has been aimed deliberately at denying those two councils the capacity to act in the interests of their communities. Secondly, the response is trying to send a shot across the bows of every other local government in this country to make sure they don't go down the same road that Yarra City Council and Darebin City Council did.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a conversation that my home state of Tasmania is having right now, in Hobart City Council. Put simply, the government's response to this, this vindictive mendacious response, is nothing other than a denial of free speech. The aldermen who made these decisions have been democratically elected, and the aldermen and councillors are being robbed of their right to participate in a public conversation about the date on which we should celebrate our national day. This sort of overreach, this sort of vindictive and mendacious behaviour, is all too typical of this government. They will spend months fighting for their right to say the 'N' word by gutting the Racial Discrimination Act, then they come down with a furious and purportedly righteous anger against councils who are simply trying to be respectful to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That tells you everything you need to know about the kind of speech that this government prefers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All Australians ought to be able to participate in the celebration of our country, and the Liberals, quite frankly, should get out of the way of councils who are progressive and who are demonstrating the courage of their convictions. Councils should not be able to be bullied, and that's what the government is trying to do. Make no mistake; the government is trying to bully councils out of an important conversation, and councils ought not be bullied by a vindictive minister acting like a school prefect on a power trip. That's what we are here to deal with today. That is exactly the way that the assistant minister for immigration, Mr Hawke, is acting—like a schoolyard bully. When you look at the legislative instrument, it reads like it was written by a year 2 student telling everyone else who did not get an invitation to their birthday party. When it lists who in Victoria can conduct a citizenship ceremony, it says: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was really instructive for this Senate to have a look at a couple of things that Mr Hawke said at the time. He said this in his media release in response to the decision of Yarra City Council's decision: 'Politicising citizenship ceremonies will not be tolerated.' Well, guess what? Denying Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people their historical experience is a political decision. Celebrating a day of invasion in this country is a political decision, particularly when Mr Hawke knows full well—or ought to know—the hurt that it causes so many Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember: the senior minister in this shambles, Mr Dutton, infamously boycotted the apology to the stolen generation. That's who we're dealing with here. Make no mistake, it's Minister Dutton who is pulling Mr Hawke's strings in regard to this. How dare Mr Dutton pretend to care a single jot about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I've got news for Mr Hawke, who said that politicising citizenship ceremonies will not be tolerated: we actually live in a democracy, not a dictatorship, and who can conduct citizenship ceremonies is a matter for the parliament, not the minister. That's why he's had to bring in a disallowable instrument, to try to change and remove the authority of people on the two relevant councils.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what we're doing here today—and I thank in advance those other members of this chamber who've indicated that they'll be supporting this disallowance—is standing up. We're standing up for the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians who want to be able to celebrate Australia Day on a day that is not Invasion Day, on a day that doesn't remind them of the hurt and the dispossession and the racism that they've faced since Europeans arrived in this country; we're standing up for local governments to be able to make their own decisions for the benefit of their communities and reflect the hopes, aspirations and values of the people who elect them and pay their rates in those local governments; and we're standing up for freedom of speech, which we hear so much about in this place but which in fact, when it comes to the Liberals, the Nationals, Senator Bernardi and some of their fellow travellers, actually is not something that they truly believe in except in the very narrow frame of being able to allow themselves and their fellow travellers to engage in racist hate speech in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we're very proud today to stand up for all those things and to make sure that this government understands that, in a parliamentary democracy, they can make all the threats that they like and put out all the disparaging media releases that they want to but, at the end of the day, this is a disallowable instrument and the Senate is going to have its say on this. I truly believe, based on the advice that I've received, that this vindictive, pernicious, mendacious instrument that's been tabled in this place by the government is going to be disallowed at the end of this debate, and that'll be a great day. If there's any hope that I have, it is that this is a small step on a journey that one day sees our national celebration, Australia Day, occur on a date that is not so hurtful and harmful to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BERNARDI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:58</span>):  I want to thank Senator McKim for his illuminating speech, because it explains a lot. Who would have known that the anger and the hatred towards one's own countrymen manifests itself in being excluded from a three-year-old's birthday party? I have to tell you, Madam Deputy President, that Senator McKim might not have been welcome as a three-year-old. There are many birthday parties he wouldn't be welcome at today, because he carries on against the national interests of this country, and the simple fact that he's dressed this up as some racism debate and says that those who disagree with him are guilty of some racist hate speech tells you about the evil that lurks within—the trauma, the torment, that must be driving this pernicious behaviour that is just about destroying and tearing down the things that are meant to celebrate and unite us as a nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things I say as a conservative is that we have built institutions, and things have evolved over centuries—in this country, over many generations—and they've evolved for a particular reason: to bring people together to ensure there is the maximum civil society and the maximum freedom available. What I note is those on the progressive agenda like Senator McKim hate those institutions because they claim they oppress everyone else and they want to tear them down. What they're good at is ripping down things and destroying things, but they are not good at building them. They've got nothing to replace them with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens call themselves the 'global Green movement'. Their former leader—who, by the way, supported coal-fired power over the Franklin Dam—the person they idolise and adore and revere is the person who said there should be one world government, and yet here they are defending the rights and the roles of councils. They hate councils unless they're stacked full of leftists and Greens. And—what a coincidence—haven't we got a council or two that fulfil that description here?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's make this point: this disallowance motion incorporates two exceptions in the list of people who the Commonwealth authorises to receive a citizenship pledge or commitment. The two exceptions are the City of Yarra council and the City of Darebin council, both in the heart of Green territory in the Melbourne metropolitan area. Councils are allowed to provide citizenship ceremonies, as are others, at the behest of the minister for citizenship and immigration. That is their role and, yes, it is a disallowable instrument. But it is absolutely trite and pathetic for Senator McKim and the Greens to drive some sort of wedge into our national psyche on the basis that some extremists who have captured these two councils are pursuing their goal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at this. The City of Yarra council covers Richmond, Collingwood and Fitzroy in inner Melbourne. The City of Yarra councillors comprise—lo and behold—four Greens councillors, two ALP councillors, two independents and one from the Socialist Alliance. It is pretty hard to pick them all apart; they're all in the same boat. But I have to say that one of these councillors, Mi-Lin Chen Yi Mei, enthusiastically welcomed the passage of the motion abandoning Australia Day. There's someone who enthusiastically welcomed the passage of the motion abandoning Australia Day. This is left-wing nonsense propagated by the far extreme left that is so damaging to all the things that made this country what it is today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting to note the City of Yarra council also received a motion which it passed earlier this month asking for Australia to adopt the Rohingya asylum seekers, which, of course, is another Greens policy. It was introduced by the Greens mayor, Amanda Stone, backed by the Greens councillor Misha Coleman. Do you notice anything inconsistent with this? The people who loathe our country the most are the Greens and their associates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The City of Darebin council later considered a similar motion at the behest of its mayor, Greens councillor Kim Le Cerf. Darebin covers the suburbs of Northcote, Coburg and Reservoir. Its council is comprised of four Greens, three independents and two ALP councillors, absolutely representative of the Australian people—that's called sarcasm, Madam Deputy President Reynolds! But, to her credit, Labor Councillor Williams was a voice of common sense, publicly questioning the proposal and belling the cat by saying it's crazy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moreland City Council, in Melbourne's suburban north, in mid-September became the third council to abandon Australia Day. They abandoned the day on which we celebrate us becoming a country, effectively—the day that European settlement started the establishment of this country as we know it today. But Greens councillor and then deputy mayor Samantha Ratnam's motion prevailed, seven votes to four, for which the Greens promptly rewarded her this week by rushing her into the Victorian Legislative Council to further undermine the Australian Constitution, to replace resigning Greens leader Greg Barber. What I find extraordinary is that this person was installed into the council, and had no political experience outside of being a mayor, but, because of her diligent work, was made leader of the Greens in Victoria—no political experience necessary. It says all you need to know. It's the ideology—the ability to carry the Marxist Green agenda right through the institutions. The more you wreck, the more havoc you cause, the more you destroy, the more you are rewarded under the Greens' program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This trend was set in train by the Fremantle council in metropolitan Perth, which initially proposed doing what the Yarra and Darebin councils have done. But, when the government quite rightly warned them, 'We will take your citizenship rights away from you,' they relented and instead chose another day, 28 January—a separate, so-called 'One Day in Freo' event designed for Aboriginal Australians to stage an alternative ceremony. There are many Aboriginal Australians that I know who are happy with Australia Day where it is. It just seems there is an extreme element amongst them who are intent once again on ripping into whatever celebration there is and using it as a cause for division. That is what is being fuelled by the Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not only in Western Australia and Victoria. In my own state of South Australia we've got this headline-seeking, virtue-signalling council, the City of Marion council, where a councillor moved to abandon Australia Day too. Not one other councillor, I'm pleased to say, seconded that motion. We had one person who loathed our country so much and couldn't even find that support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More councils and councillors are sounding out their ratepayers about what to do on this issue, and this is the Greens' modus operandi: they make it untenable for people to have an alternative point of view. We saw that today with Senator McKim, wo is still lamenting not being able to blow out the candles at a three-year-old's birthday party. He wants to call everyone pejorative names such as 'hate speakers' for speaking up for Australia Day—a 'racist hate speech' for defending Australia Day. That's what we heard in the Senate. This is extremism writ large, and they dare to call others extremists and radicals. These people are getting hold of inner city councils. They're getting hold of institutional power, which they are using against the national interest. It should be of concern for all of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I give this history and these concerns because the genesis of this issue and this division lies firmly with the Australian Greens. It's cashing in, if you will, on the nonsense that is growing out of parts of America and, to a lesser degree, the United Kingdom, where the political left—the socialists, the communists, the cultural Marxists—want to rewrite history and erase their heritage and their past because suddenly they've determined that it causes offence. In America and Australia we're seeing people all of a sudden complain about statues that have been there for decades, demanding that they be covered up or the plaques be replaced. Lo and behold, who's behind that? It's the same cultural ideology that has infected the Greens party and is leaking out into other sections of society. It is about promoting this black armband view of Australia's history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's history is what it is. Like every country, there are imperfections in it. There are things that we all wish hadn't happened, but they go together—just like how in all our individual lives there are things we regret and wish we hadn't done, but there are also things we wish we had done and actions we wish we had taken when we didn't. But they go to making you the person that you are today, just like our history, like it or lump it, goes towards making us the country that we are today. We cannot erase that history. It's not about atoning for it; it is about getting on and making sure we can move forward together. You do not do that by ripping the country apart as the Greens are seeking to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a question here about what on earth can motivate people to pursue this path of division, rancour and abuse. I'd like to characterise it as the misuse of power. Some would be even more aggressive in the language that they use: that this is, effectively, treacherous behaviour towards your country. People are right to question the desires of people who are intent upon destroying the institutions that help to make us what we are today. And it comes back to the agenda of the Greens, belled by former leader and former Senator Bob Brown, who spoke to fellow Earthians. He said we haven't been visited by aliens because they didn't like what we were doing to the planet down here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He did begin a speech by saying 'fellow Earthians' on his approach to one world government, where everyone gets one vote. You know what? The 20-odd million people in Australia wouldn't get too much of a say in that one world government that the Greens so desire. They want governance by the elites. They believe that they know better than anyone else, that they can virtue-signal and that they can pursue things without being critically assessed for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make no bones about it: Australian Conservatives wholeheartedly and 100 per cent support Australia Day. And this is not to gloss over our history. This is not to recognise that our history doesn't have highs and lows. But we have evolved; we have moved together as a nation to become the country that we are today. It is the best country in the world as far as I'm concerned. Yes, we have some challenges, but the challenges are not 26 January; the challenges are the fact that too few people are prepared to make a contribution to this country in a financial sense, which is leading people in this place to make decisions that we are leaving to future generations to sort out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I regret that part of the problem is the fragmentation of this extreme leftist agenda, that says they know best and that they can govern better than individuals can manage their own affairs. That is the totalitarian nature of the Greens. That is the big problem confronting our country. Days like Australia Day, Christmas and Easter, our regular festivities and our traditions, are the things that bind and build our culture together. The Greens and their acolytes have no interest in perpetuating the culture that binds us together. They want to destroy, to tear down, the things that makes this country good so that they can reinvent it in their neo-Marxist image.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an absolute disgrace that Senator McKim uses his democratic right to trash our country in this place. He's meant to be better than that; he should be better than that. He's still carrying the internal grievance and the hatred that he has for other people because he wasn't included and invited to a birthday party as a three-year-old. This is a man with a serious psychological chip on his shoulder, and he shouldn't be carrying it in this place.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:12</span>):  I just take this opportunity to point out the Labor Party's position on this motion before the chamber. I indicate that Labor supports Australia Day—and let me be very, very clear about this: we have no plans to change it. We do understand the importance of a national day, and we know that many Australians take pride in Australia Day. But we also understand that for many, including Indigenous Australians, Australia Day is a day which represents a history of dispossession and suffering, and we cannot ignore that. So Labor will be supporting this motion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But let me be clear about these childish games being played by both the government and by the Greens: they will do nothing to progress the cause of reconciliation, nor will they create a better future for Indigenous Australians. Stripping local councils of their capacity to conduct citizenship ceremonies is a gross overreaction by government. It is a pathetic infringement of what is a scheduling decision by municipal councils. This government: does it really not have anything better to do? Why have they been so focused on these issues? Why aren't they focused on the real questions about jobs and health care and education? If the Prime Minister wants to be the mayor of Point Piper, he's free to do so. The Greens political party have been just as bad, politicising a legitimate discussion with Indigenous Australians about reconciliation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports a process of truth telling as part of the nation's healing, and that's why the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, has expressed support for the recommendations of the Referendum Council, which has called for a Makarrata Commission to oversee the process of truth telling and agreement making.</span>

We oppose this disallowance. I look across and I'm honoured and pleased to see two Indigenous senators in the chamber. That is all we need to know that the Indigenous are one with us and that we have similar issues that we need to face.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I remind senators that last month I went on an extensive tour of Cape York and visited every Aboriginal community, with the exception of Aurukun, which was closed because of Sorry Day business. Up there, we see people talking about other groups—whitefellas; blackfellas—and that is the second sign, because they are not talking in denigrating terms or derogatory terms about each other. They are talking with respect for the other people's culture. While I was in Cape York, not one person across the entirety of Cape York and all the communities raised with me the issue of wanting to change Australia Day. We need to go further, though. We need to stop funding all councils that interfere with Australian icons, heritage and statues, and any local government that wants to rewrite history—because what One Nation says is 'yes' to Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly—families. Families are fundamental to responsibility. There are two organisations that are essential for responsibility and in the organisation of human affairs: the family and the nation-state. The Greens, sadly, want to destroy both. We, instead, want to bring back and support families. We want to bring back one nation for all Australians because we cherish Australia and our institutions that are Australian.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:17</span>):  I rise to speak on the motion moved by Senator McKim and Senator Siewert for the disallowance of the legislative instruments made under the Australian Citizenship Act. The regulation revokes the authority of the Yarra and Darebin councils and their officials to hold citizenship ceremonies. It lists the mayor, the deputy mayor, the CEO, the general manager and even the administrator of those councils. It sends the message that any council in the future would be named in this regulation if, at the local level, they decide to have a different date for citizenship ceremonies. These instruments were created to bring down pressure from the federal government on local government communities that have taken decisions, after discussions with their communities, to consider holding citizenship ceremonies on a day other than 26 January. This is a very heavy-handed way to deal with a very, very sensitive issue of concern to many in our community. Fascism reigns when you do this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issues underlying this are well known and have been for many years. We live in a democracy and people should have the right to debate matters of concern in their communities and in this nation as a whole. Labor are not calling, as you've heard, for a change to the date of Australia Day, but we understand that, for many people, including many first-nations people, 26 January represents dispossession and sadness—a legacy we struggle with in this nation and in this place, constantly, to get social policy settings right. We cannot behave in an idiotic manner when serious discussion is required, and we cannot afford to ignore this matter. It is some three months since the Referendum Council placed its report and recommendations in the hands of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  Free speech is one of the great virtues that underpin our society. Failure to celebrate free speech, especially for one's political or ideological opponents, is to seriously undermine this foundational institution of our society. Universities as institutions of learning should not only defend but actively encourage free speech, allowing for robust discussion to enable logical assessments to be made by our fellow citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the self-evident benefits of free speech, we are witnessing a creeping, ugly totalitarianism that seeks to stifle if not completely stop the exercise of free speech in our society. You've guessed it: it's done in the name of tolerance, whilst at the same time the perpetrators engage in name-calling, calling opponents hateful or bigots—insert insult of choice—all in the cause of virtue-signalling their love, their inclusiveness and, of course, their tolerance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, Balliol College at the University of Oxford banned their Christian group from its open day, not because the group had done anything wrong but because of alleged misdeeds by Christianity in the past. The university administration did step in, but it was too late for that open day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, my local university, shamefully, initially refused to provide facilities for the holding of a forum to present the no case in the current postal survey. To its credit, the university reversed its decision. I congratulate the university for doing so. Regrettably, this is not the end of the story. There is now an ugly rearguard action being run by a group, including senior lecturers, seeking signatures to a petition to condemn the university for its commitment to free speech. Make no mistake: when senior lecturers email students seeking support, the pressure to sign is immense. The absence of a signature may well be noted. Students and other underlings of a senior lecturer will hardly feel free not to sign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, that's how I became aware of the letter. A person felt intimidated. The covering letter of the senior lecturer refers to her feeling 'disgusted and hurt'. The opening paragraph of the proposed letter to the university does not deal with the matters of principle, like the universal human right to free speech. No, the great intellectual argument was expressed as follows: 'We are writing to express our disappointment in relation to the university's decision to make the Burbury Lecture Theatre available to the Coalition for Marriage. It would be possible for each of us to respond by detailing the ways in which this action has profoundly affected us. We feel betrayed, let down, insulted, offended, frustrated, disillusioned and humiliated.' It's all about their subjective feelings: they feel betrayed, let down et cetera.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you operate on actual principle, you ask: how would you feel if the boot were on the other foot? Do unto others as you would have done unto you. Did the intellectuals, before deciding on their campaign, ask those to whom they would deny a facility to hold their forum how they would feel? Could they feel profoundly affected? Could they feel betrayed and let down that an institution of learning and free thought denied them the right to meet? Could they feel insulted, offended, frustrated, disillusioned and, indeed, humiliated—to use their language—by being told they are not worthy to express their views? Could their self-esteem and mental health have been impacted? An honest answer to these questions exposes not only the hypocrisy of the perpetrators but an ugly intolerance that puts personal subjective feelings above the universally recognised human right of free speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those that seek to shut down free speech because they don't like what is being said today would do well to remember that, if that becomes the standard, their freedom will be similarly shut down by others tomorrow. We all win and protect each other for our mutual individual and societal good and benefit if we allow freedom of speech to flourish. That is why everyone should support the university's decision, irrespective of their view on the survey. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week in Adelaide I met with members of Bangladeshi community and I was pleased to receive this petition from them. The federal opposition is deeply concerned at reports of human rights abuses in Myanmar and the resulting humanitarian crisis currently facing Bangladesh. The international community and people here in Australia have been shocked by horrific stories and images coming out of Myanmar and Bangladesh. Over the past few days I, or my office, have received briefings from a range of organisations—Medecins Sans Frontieres, Save the Children, CARE Australia, Oxfam, APHEDA and UNICEF—and today I met with Wai Wai Nu, a peace and women's rights activist from Myanmar. I would like to thank these groups and individuals for taking the time to send representation to Canberra and brief parliamentarians and their offices on the crisis in Myanmar and Bangladesh.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see a humanitarian crisis of catastrophic proportions. It is one of the fastest growing refugee crises in recent years. Over half a million Rohingya refugees have fled their homes in Myanmar since violence erupted in late August. Most of them are now living near the Bangladeshi city of Cox's Bazar, which borders Myanmar. The entire land area of the camps and informal settlements, which is about 10 square kilometres in size, is simply not equipped for the influx in population and is under severe strain in terms of resources, infrastructure and space. Reports of violent attacks against the Rohingya community in Rakhine State have been corroborated by international NGOs and medical evidence. Having arrived with very few possessions or savings, the Rohingya population in Cox's Bazar is dependent on humanitarian assistance for basic services. It is a population which is highly vulnerable, and the risk of an outbreak of disease is high.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">United Nations officials have described the crimes committed against the Rohingya as 'a textbook example of ethnic cleansing' and Human Rights Watch has called them 'crimes against humanity'. The opposition has made formal representations to the Prime Minister and the foreign minister, and we continue to urge the Australian government to do everything it can to respond to this escalating crisis and to speak out on human rights. In particular, we call on the government to pledge further funds to aid those affected by the violence in Rakhine State at the donor pledging conference in Geneva on 23 October. We call for the full implementation of the Kofi Annan report and the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State recommendations, which seek to prevent violence, maintain peace and foster reconciliation. We call on the government to work to establish an independent UN investigation into human rights abuses in Myanmar and to continue holding the government of Myanmar to account, especially the military, for its conduct and for its continued obligation to respect the human rights of all its people. We call for the government to support unimpeded humanitarian access to the camps in Bangladesh and to work closely with regional partners on a medium- and long-term response to the refugee crisis, seeking to ensure that the Rohingya population has a secure place to live in peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia and the Australian community have a deep affection for Myanmar. We have assisted Myanmar through economic reform, peace negotiations and its complex transition to democracy. We have watched its transitions and its democracy project with hope. In the face of this current escalating crisis we urge the government of Myanmar to recommit to pursue peace and national reconciliation. We offer our full support for efforts to achieve sustained peace and genuine reconciliation. The situation presents the State Counsellor and Nobel laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and the government more broadly, an opportunity to exercise moral authority to protect the human rights of its citizens and to mediate a peaceful resolution to the current crisis. We believe it is in Myanmar's own interests for this conflict to be responded to fairly and resolved peacefully.</span>

Recent events in the High Court—I'm not talking about the munificent 7 and their dual-citizenship imbroglio—make it look like somebody has been reading my mail. The High Court has found that for years the Supreme Court of Victoria has been handing down sentences that are far too lenient—no shit, Sherlock! In some cases, such as incest, jail terms—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator HINCH:</span>
                  </a>  In some serious cases, such as incest, jail terms for a heinous crime have been 'anomalously low for decades.' Some of us have been going on about this for decades. It's why we formed the Justice Party and why I got voted into this place in the first place. It's why I'm standing here tonight. It's why a lot of us keep urging the DPP to appeal light sentences on the grounds that they are manifestly inadequate by accepted community standards. The latest trigger was a case of child abuse—a case of incest—where a man sexually abused his partner's 13-year-old daughter and made her pregnant. He impregnated a vulnerable little girl, and his sentence was only 3½ years in jail. A child's innocence was taken, a life was scarred forever, and his sentence was only 3½ years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Victoria Police Commissioner Kel Glare says that the High Court's ruling that this sentence was anomalously low could be what he called a turning point, at which sentencing starts to reflect community standards. The former police chief has very strong views on this. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Hopefully this decision will be a turning point and Victorians will see the judiciary in this state begin to reflect community expectations in sentencing and parole practices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former commissioner also said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For too long, magistrates, judges and the parole board in this state have not met the expectation of the community, nor in justice being done and being seen to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I couldn't agree with him more, especially in relation to crimes against children, especially when trusted relatives are involved and especially in the area of the possession of child pornography. Too often men are given light or even suspended sentences because a judge notes that the videos and images were for a person's 'personal use only'. They ignore the fact that for a video to be made or a photo to be taken a young boy or young girl has suffered grievously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a new Chief Justice in Victoria, Justice Anne Ferguson. The state's Victims of Crime Commissioner, Greg Davies, sees that appointment as what he called 'the perfect opportunity to bridge' what he sees as—and I agree with him—'the widening gap between our expectations and the judiciary's approach to sentencing.' Greg Davies is a former Police Association secretary. He says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… there was an "an obvious disconnect between judges and the broader public".</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is an opportunity for the court. If they show they are prepared to accept what the community has been saying for a very long time and now what the High Court is saying, to take the opportunity and raise sentencing principles of community protection and punishment of an offender above current sentencing standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I genuinely hope that this happens. It's what I've been talking about and protesting about for years. It's what I've gone to jail over. It's what I've had the indignity of wearing an electronic ankle bracelet for five months over. It's what I spent two weeks in solitary confinement over. On this occasion the High Court must be applauded. I just hope it washes off on courts, not only in Victoria but all over Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Saturday, 14 October, was McHappy Day. McHappy Day is one of the largest national fundraisers for Ronald McDonald House, a charity that has been running in Australia for over 25 years. It was my privilege to attend the Erindale McDonald's restaurant and to assist the owner, Ben Stockbridge, in serving customers. I was on the drive-thru. It was a wonderful time, with all sorts of activities, from car shows to face painting. Two dollars from each Big Mac sold on the day was donated by McDonald's to Ronald McDonald House, which is a truly amazing charity. Those who have experienced it and seen it in action know that it gives support to so many families who are doing it tough, whose kids are in hospital. The first Ronald McDonald House opened in Camperdown in 1981. It has been one of our great charities. There are now 16 Ronald McDonald Houses in Australia and more than 360 worldwide. So, in the time I have left, I want to say well done to McDonald's, well done to Ronald McDonald House and well done to Ben Stockbridge at Erindale McDonalds and all the other proprietors of McDonald's who support this wonderful charity.</span>

                  <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  Today in Canberra we enjoyed a beautiful sunny day. Indeed, many Australian towns enjoyed unseasonably warm weather today, up in the high 20s and 30s. Around the country, Australians were taking advantage of the weather to indulge in an ice cream—maybe a Magnum, maybe a Golden Gaytime or perhaps indulging in the childhood nostalgia of a chocolate Paddle Pop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Far less enjoyable than ice cream are the current challenges that are faced by the workers who make those ice creams—the workers at the Streets Ice Cream factory in Minto. In July, staff at Streets Ice Cream rejected a proposed new enterprise agreement. This isn't uncommon in a process of negotiation. But rather than continue to negotiate, Unilever, the British company that owns Streets, applied to terminate the 2013 agreement. The case will be heard by the Fair Work Commission later in the year. If the application to terminate the agreement is successful, the employees will revert to the award rate for the food industry. In some cases, their union, the AMWU, argues, this will almost halve hourly rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a significant broader issue here: employers are terminating enterprise agreements as an industrial tactic. It works like this: firstly, the employer fails to properly engage with staff and unions on a proposed new agreement. Indeed, dragging it out and failing to reach an agreement actually benefits these employers. They've got no interest in renewing the current agreement. Once the agreement's out of date, the employer terminates the old agreement, citing a deadlock. What you see is actually a pretend negotiation, where the aim is to sabotage the bargaining process in order to reach the true goal, which is to terminate the enterprise agreement. There is no opportunity for bargaining because these companies aren't interested in negotiations. That is what is happening at Streets now and it's what we saw happen at Carlton &amp; United Breweries. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The decisions to terminate agreements at Horizon Power, Esso and AGL show that the use of agreement termination and the threat of award wages as a business tactic can have a devastating effect. The approach preys on vulnerable workers and targets people who are not in a position to reject minimum wages. It disadvantages people who don't have the resources to match the deep pockets of a large multinational corporation. In a time of record low wages growth, work conditions are more important than ever. Overtime, shiftwork and other pay and conditions might be ideal budget lines to trim if you're a consultant with an MBA who's sitting on the other side of the world, but for many families these conditions mean the difference between getting by and missing a mortgage payment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to call this for what it is; it amounts to industrial blackmail. It's why Labor committed at the last election to stopping this practice. There should be no place in our industrial relations system for Streets Ice Cream's behaviour. Making ice cream is no excuse for leaving your workers out in the cold.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:42</span>):  As a servant of the people of Queensland and Australia, I love being out with the people and listening. I want to continue a summary of my recent trip to Cape York and to name some of the other people who we met. We got as far as York Downs—in the previous adjournment speech—where we met Sally and John Witherspoon, who both have extensive information from across Cape York. Sally has a very long history of deep involvement with the Royal Flying Doctor Service. It is essential up there, as I'll show you in a minute. They have also had some challenges with the banks and a very strong understanding of Cape York, and I felt immediately at home with a cuppa and some bickies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next day John came with us, all day, to the towns of Weipa and Mapoon. He explained some of his plans for the future, including reigniting live cattle exports. He was joined that day by Ross Benstead. We appreciated his many connections on the cape, the many insights he shared with us, his time and passion for Cape York and his support for the people up there and for us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We went the next day to Mapoon, where Peter Guivarra, the deputy mayor, did not hold back his punches. He shared his story and the history of Mapoon, and how his ancestors had been moved from near Lawn Hill Gorge up to Weipa then on to Mapoon. He shared the dislocation and the pain of that, yet there was strength in that. At the same meeting at Mapoon—and we appreciate the council at Mapoon having a meeting and a lovely little lunch with us—we were introduced to Dave, the administrator there, who strongly supports Montessori and is doing whatever he can to make sure that Montessori education flourishes on the cape. We also met Tom Smith and Chris Hancock who shared insights, including on the rangers program. Then we were back to Musgrave Station where we met up with John, Mary and the locals. The next day we went to Coen and saw a mixed group—Western, Aboriginal, and everything in between. There were Jodi Hamilton, Barbara, Yvonne, Mary and Rachel at the pub, the Coen Exchange Hotel, or, as it's more colloquially known up there, the 'sex change hotel'. We saw their openness, courage and passion for their kids, the communities and the cape, and for restoring fairness. We also met up again with Amy, Louise and Barry, the publicans at the sex change hotel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next day we went to Pormpuraaw—one of the highlights for me. We met with Edward Natera, the chief executive there. We appreciated his openness, frankness and candid behaviour—as he said, 'No kiss-arse talk' from him—and bluntness. We also met with Paul Jakubowski, whose leadership and passion are essential for the arts community there, which has exhibitions in New York, Houston and Switzerland. Then I met with Sid Bruce. What a wonderful time I had there, with his open sharing about his culture. He's a wonderful artist who is dedicated to future generations. With Sid, you could just feel his understanding and love of culture, dance and language. He is down to earth; he looked me in the eye and just said what he thought and felt. And then there was Ganthi Kuppusamy, the CEO of an organisation up there, who came over and introduced herself. I thank her for her sharing. There was also Grace Morris, a young lady with openness, caring and passion, who takes admirable care of the arts centre and the graduates of high school programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next day we got lost, in the middle of Cape York. My thanks to Amy at Drumduff Station whose helpfulness, directions, smile and care helped us out. At the other end of that, we met with Thomas and Tomaz, who went well out of their way to help us. There were Harold and Jeans in Laura, and the electrical contractors at Dunbar Station. Getting lost in the middle of Cape York on a road that was poorly signed just shows how fragile life can be up there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the people of Moura—which is not in Cape York but was on the trip that preceded the trip to Cape York—Maureen, the councillor; Brooke, who gave us a very good introduction; and Brad, who gave us an introduction to a bull stud. I want to acknowledge Senator Ian Macdonald and Mr Warren Entsch, from the House of Representatives, for their immediate support and open welcome when I came back from Cape York. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:47</span>):  There is a statistic and a fact that should be damning to all of us. It is this: when we go, on a weekend, to a Bunnings and are greeted by a worker—often a young male or female, often a student—that worker is getting paid 20 to 30 per cent more than the people working in aged care in this country who are looking after the people who are dearest and nearest to us. The average aged-care worker in Australia is currently being paid $21 to look after the people who are most important and most significant to all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is this: we have an ageing population, and we have an ageing community. The miracle of modern health care means that people will be living for longer and longer. We should be celebrating that as a society. But the facts, when it comes to aged care and the reality of aged care, are damning, shocking and horrific.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay a small tribute to Senator Helen Polley, who has been advocating this case and using the Senate committee process to highlight this. I note that there have been many people from different political parties—it's not just a Labor issue—who have highlighted the real cause for concern about aged care in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the campaign being run by the Health Services Union of New South Wales and across the country which is called Our Turn To Care, which is about highlighting the horrible levels of pay, the terrible conditions and the low ratio numbers that exist in some of these aged-care facilities. Governments are about priorities. Budgets are about priorities. When you can find $50 billion for business tax cuts, when you can find $122 million or $127 million for a marriage survey that nobody wants, surely you can find the money to pay some of Australia's most maligned, hardest working and underrecognised people, and those are the people involved in Australia's aged-care industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the work that's being run by Gerard Hayes, the secretary of that union, but also by the rank and file, who have realised that it's not good enough to simply say an outcome. You have to go out there and run the campaign on the ground to win the campaign with the people and to build that case through community activism and through grassroots.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These facts are astounding. The average aged-care worker in this country is likely to be female—that's 88 per cent of them—is likely to be over 49 years old, and is likely to be in a major city, where two-thirds of them are found. The fact that there are over 235,000 people working in residential care and 130,000 people working in home care support shows just how many people are affected by this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a society and in this Senate, we have to make decisions. We have to make choices. We have to decide whether or not we're going to be providing adequate care to our families, to the people who matter most to us. I just want to take a small moment to congratulate the Health Services Union for the campaign that they're running.</span>

                  <a href="122087" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:52</span>):  I'd like to pay tribute to an amazing woman whose life we celebrated recently in Townsville, Dr Evelyn Scott. A state funeral was held for Dr Scott, and I was able to attend the service along with my colleagues Senator Pat Dodson; Warren Snowdon, the member for Lingiari; and Cathy O'Toole, the member for Herbert, who was very instrumental in supporting the family to make sure that such an amazing woman was farewelled in a wonderful way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Evelyn Scott certainly inspired women across the country but particularly first-nations people. Her story is really one of humble beginnings. Her grandfather was from Vanuatu. He was enslaved, brought across here to work in the sugarcane fields. She grew up in Townsville and had an incredibly deep sense of human rights and social justice. She was certainly a warrior for her people, an incredible champion for reconciliation here in this country and fearless in every sense of the word. She was a very tall woman whose presence was so commanding. And I remember on so many occasions having the pleasure to meet with her, laugh with her and learn from her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the state funeral, we heard from a number of people who gave tremendous reflections on Dr Scott's life, in particular her very close friend Pat Turner, the CEO of NACCHO, who remembered her. She said that Dr Scott's presence was commanding, as was her contribution. I think one of the things that really stood out to me and no doubt stood out to many others who attended the state funeral was hearing about the early days of Dr Scott's life, the strength with which her own family persevered and navigated a way of life in Far North Queensland, and the combination of her Vanuatu heritage and her Aboriginal heritage. Her father instilled in her incredible values with the saying, 'If you don't think something is right, challenge it.' Dr Scott lived with that and challenged things all the way through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the early areas that she stepped into was really the push for the 1967 referendum. Her friends and her supporters were people like Eddie Mabo, Faith Bandler and Joe McGuinness, and they're just a few of the stalwarts of first-nations people in the lead-up to the 1967 referendum, the most successful referendum this country has had. Dr Scott was there at the forefront of all of that and worked behind the scenes to encourage Australians to look at the injustices in our country and to vote yes for first-nations people in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She then went on to become the first-ever general secretary of the Indigenous-controlled Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, or FCAATSI, in 1973. It was an incredible feat not only to be the general secretary of this organisation, which gave so much hope to first-nations people across the country, but to be a woman in this organisation and to stand strong and inspire other young women—in particular, her four daughters, amazing women themselves—and her son.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Scott has left five children and seven grandchildren, all of whom would have felt incredibly proud of the tributes that were given to such an inspiring and very graceful woman. That's something that I recall in my meetings with her. One of the things the Senate may recall is the walk across the bridge for reconciliation. Remember when thousands and thousands of people walked across the Sydney Harbour Bridge? The person who inspired that walk was Dr Evelyn Scott. And to this day I think that when we consider even the images of Australians walking together—again, to bring unity, to bring compassion—it reminds people that we have to find a way within all our differences to walk together. Dr Evelyn Scott not only talked about it; she walked about it, and that walk reflected exactly that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that's something we can always be very proud of, and we must never forget that. I want to say personally from the people of the Northern Territory and in particular from my families in the gulf region—the Yanyuwa, Garrwa, Mara and Kudanji peoples—thank you to Dr Evelyn Scott for her contribution to our country and her contribution in particular to bringing all Australians together.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:58</span>):  This is Anti-Poverty Week, when we pay attention to issues of poverty in this country. The aims of Anti-Poverty Week this year are to strengthen public understanding of the causes and consequences of poverty and hardship around the world and in Australia and to encourage research, discussion and action to address these problems, including action by individuals, communities, organisations and government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of what I'm going to talk about tonight is the actions that the government needs to be taking to address poverty. I think there are a number of community organisations doing some really essential work, and I will be talking about the outcomes of some of that work during my talk as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As far as we in the Greens are concerned, far too many people in this country battle daily with poverty and the impacts of poverty and inequality. Living in poverty has significant negative effects on people's physical and mental wellbeing, on societal cohesion and stability and on economic growth and productivity, to the point where we have seen industry and business talking about its impacts and the need to address the issues around poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, there are 2,990,300 people—that's 13 per cent of our population—living below the poverty line. That's after taking account of their housing costs. Of those, 731,000 are children under the age of 15. In fact, 17.4 per cent of all children are living below the poverty line. People who rely on social security as their main source of income are particularly vulnerable to living in poverty and hardship, with 57.3 per cent of people on income support living below the poverty line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And there are some particularly vulnerable groups in that cohort of people. Fifty-five per cent of people receiving Newstart allowance are living in poverty, 51.5 per cent of people receiving parenting payment are living in poverty, 36.2 per cent of those receiving disability support pension are living in poverty, 29.3 per cent of people receiving carer payment are living in poverty and 13.9 per cent of those living on the age pension are living in poverty. These are not just statistics; these are real people living in poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Sunday the Australian Council of Social Service released a report titled <span style="font-style:italic;">A future for all children: addressing child poverty in Australia</span>. Remember that 17.4 per cent of all children are living in poverty. It found that Australia's child poverty trend is heading in the wrong direction. It is absolutely essential that we address this issue and change it. Poverty has a devastating impact on children and their wellbeing. The report found that children and young people deprived of food, clothes and other materials have reduced engagement with school, sometimes due to hunger, shame or being excluded or marginalised. It impacts children's development, education and eventually employment opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Salvation Army 2017 report on children in families from a little bit earlier this year included a total of 1,495 children across 638 households and found that more than half experienced severe deprivation and went without five or more essential day-to-day items. The top 10 items that respondents to this survey could not afford for their children related to connectedness, education, social participation and basic nutrition. For households with children aged 17 or younger, nearly two in five could not afford fresh fruit or vegetables every day and nearly one in four could not afford three meals a day. Approximately one in five could not afford medical treatment or medicine prescribed by the doctor. Nearly one in three could not afford a yearly dental check-up for the child. Half could not afford to update school items, and 56 per cent did not have money to participate in school activities. More than half—55 per cent—could not afford a hobby or other activities for the child. Almost three in five respondents could not afford an internet connection for their child.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must address child poverty as a priority. The ACOSS report finds the federal government could reduce child poverty by committing to reduce poverty by at least 50 per cent by 2030 in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. I was so pleased this afternoon when the Senate passed the motion calling on the government to commit to reducing poverty by at least 50 per cent by 2030. ACOSS also talks about increasing the Newstart allowance, including for single parents—and I'll come back to that issue—establishing a single-parent supplement that increases as children grow older and they cost more to support; indexing the working-age and family payments to wage movements as well as prices; improving employment and training programs for single parents, including career counselling and vocational training; guaranteeing secure, affordable housing, including working with state and territory governments to abolish no-cause evictions; and restoring two days of weekly subsidised child care to make sure it's available to parents not in paid employment. These are excellent ways to start addressing issues around poverty and child poverty in particular.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to focus on single-parent households for a minute or two because these households are particularly vulnerable and have faced perverse tightening of their income support over the last five years. The latest research from the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales found that single parents receiving Newstart allowance are unable to afford a minimum healthy standard of living. At $544 per week, that includes Newstart, the family tax benefit and rent assistance. The social security payments fall short of a minimum budget by $132 per week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Absurdly, social security payments for single parents fall as their children grow older and become more expensive. Anybody who has brought up teenagers knows how expensive they are. The ACOSS report found that when their youngest child turns five, family tax benefits drop by $23 per week. When their youngest child turns eight, the parent is moved from the parenting payment onto the lower Newstart allowance, cutting the family's income by another $85 a week—an issue some people might think that I have spoken about ad nauseam in this chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016, the unemployment rate amongst single parents was 14 per cent, more than twice the national unemployment rate of six per cent. This reflects the challenges faced by single parents to find child care, retrain and find a job that is family friendly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The social safety net is failing to address poverty. Not long ago I also outlined how far behind the Newstart payment is in terms of allowing people to get out of poverty. I remind the chamber that the University of New South Wales recently released their report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Budget Standards: A new healthy living minimum income standard for low-paid and unemployed Australians</span>. This report outlined just how far Newstart is falling behind the norms. The report found for those out of work and reliant on Newstart allowance, the safety net provisions fall short of budget standards estimates by $96 a week for a single person, $58 a week for a couple with one child, and $126 a week for a couple with two children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Newstart and youth allowance are particularly woefully inadequate. It is absolutely time that the Newstart and youth allowance rates were increased. Otherwise, we are going to be condemning families to live in poverty and fall further and further behind. I urge the government to commit to at least halving poverty by 2030 and to increase the Newstart allowance.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:07</span>):  Tonight I also rise to speak about an issue that is of utmost importance to our nation, especially this week, Anti-Poverty Week. Today, on the United Nations International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, despite economic growth, we continue to see the number of Australians living in poverty in our nation rise. In 2003-04, according to the Social Policy Research Centre, 11.8 per cent of Australians in our nation lived in poverty. In 2014, that number rose to 12.6 per cent. In 2016, ACOSS released a report indicating that poverty has risen again to 13.3 per cent of Australian people—that's 2.9 million people living below the internationally accepted poverty line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The international United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child says that children have the right to 'a standard of living adequate for the child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development'. These statistics mean that there are too many children in our nation failing to meet that basic test. Family payments and Newstart should at least cover the basic costs of children in a family. They should be adequate enough to cover food, housing, education and health. Sadly, too often in our nation they do not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear this government either does not understand or does not believe in the right of children in our nation to live free from poverty, and we can see this in its relentless cuts to social security in our nation. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Poverty in Australia</span> report released by ACOSS and the Social Policy Research Centre in October last year showed that people on income support, particularly those who were unemployed or sole parents, had higher rates of poverty than the rest of the population. Over the last decade the rates of poverty among single parent families increased, with around 29 per cent living in poverty in 2013-14. And that number was even higher for those on a parenting payment, at 51.5 per cent. So you can see here that we've got single parents who are the working poor in our nation. Indeed, 51.5 per cent of those on parenting payments are living in poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this evening I met with representatives from Foodbank Australia, who made obvious to me the ramifications of this level of poverty in our nation. They told me that the number of people who are regularly food insecure—that is, people who can't afford to put food on the table on a regular basis—has increased by up to 60 per cent from previous figures. Two out of five of those food-insecure families have dependent children, and most of those children are under the age of 12. Because there is simply not enough food to go around, 65,000 people are turned away from Foodbank services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We keep hearing from the government that the social security system in our nation is out of control and unaffordable. But do you know what is unaffordable in our nation? What is unaffordable is nearly three million Australians living in poverty in our nation. There are more than 730,000 children in our country living in poverty. That is what is out of control. There are 65,000 people a month being turned away from emergency relief services. That is what is out of control. In the long-term, it's this kind of poverty that is unaffordable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Research by the National Council for Single Mothers and their Children found that, since 2005, social security payments for children have in meaningful terms been reduced. For a single parent with no private income and two children over the age of eight, policy changes since 2005 have left those families more than $5,000 a year worse off, 17 per cent of their household income worse off. What we have had from the other side is continued attacks on these families. Those opposite froze family tax benefits for two years and are now looking to continue to cut payments to single parents undertaking study and extend waiting periods—and who knows what else is still to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is only one job in our nation for every 10 jobseekers, and what we have from those opposite is no plan to tackle unemployment. Instead, we've got a $65 billion tax cut to big business that is supposed to trickle down and create the jobs that these families need. But there is no plan that actually simulates employment for these people. What we also know is that child care is more difficult and less affordable than ever. These attacks are hurting real people in our community. They are attacks on families and they mean more than just numbers for the government's bottom line. What we're talking about here is parents who can't afford fresh fruit and vegetables and parents who skip meals, as Foodbank told us today. It means mums and dads have to make a choice: do they put fuel in the car or food on the table?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It means kids missing out on going on school excursions, buying equipment for school, participating in sport and participating in basic social interactions and activities. It means people being unable to afford medical treatment or dental check-ups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government attack people on welfare—when they imply that people somehow aren't doing enough to get a job and are not doing enough to earn money—they're actually attacking the children in these households and taking away the resources that they need and their parents need within that household. Changes to social security most often impact those families who are already most disadvantaged in our community. They are families who are already relying on organisations that provide emergency relief, like Vinnies, the Salvation Army, Anglicare and migrant resource centres, just to get through the week. We know that in 2014-15 the government ripped nearly $270 million from frontline social services. So, while the government are attacking families, reducing the money they have to care for their children, they are also ripping money from the services they need in order to live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is, though, that we can reduce poverty. It has been done before. Prime Minister Bob Hawke made a commitment to this nation 30 years ago that no child would be living in poverty. He was ridiculed for that in time, but the simple fact is that the commitments made by the Hawke-Keating governments reduced poverty in our nation, and child poverty specifically, by 30 per cent. They did this through a range of really important reforms that focused on giving families what they need to raise children, including a supplement for low-income families to help meet the cost of living. They increased family payments to reflect the cost of children and linked family payments to wage growth to maintain pace with the cost of living and living standards. These reforms also included rent assistance. They expanded child care and improved fee relief. The reforms also meant more education and employment support for single parents.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M0R" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:17</span>):  I rise to speak in the Senate on the recent landmark agreement between Timor-Leste and Australia. This agreement, regarding the legal status of maritime boundaries in the Timor Sea, was reached as a result of Timor-Leste's invocation of the compulsory conciliation procedures in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS. This ruling vindicates Labor's position and brings to an end more than 40 years of uncertainty over this maritime boundary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In February last year, Labor committed, when next in government, to reaching a binding international resolution with Timor-Leste, through either bilateral negotiation or international arbitration. This was an agreement that needed Australia to show good faith to be concluded, and it needed to be concluded because Timor-Leste is running out of oil and gas—which means, of course, that its economy is suffering as it's running out of money. Its main Bayu-Undan gas reserve in the Timor Sea is a field that will be exhausted within five years. So the government has been having to spend the country's sovereign wealth fund, the $16 billion petroleum fund, which accounts for 90 per cent of its annual budget, much faster than it is able to progress the development of a diversified economy, which it needs to replace the fund in question.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recall for the Senate that, since Timor-Leste became an independent nation in 2002, this maritime boundary between Timor-Leste and Australia has remained in dispute. Timor-Leste claimed that the boundary should be drawn in the middle of the sea between the two states using the principle of equidistance, under which a median line should be drawn between Australia and Timor-Leste. And, as I'm sure the Senate is aware, any delimitation drawn according to this principle would see the sea border drawn significantly closer to Australia than Timor-Leste, and the majority of gas and oil reserves in the disputed territory would fall within Timor-Leste's maritime boundary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia set its northern maritime boundary with Indonesia in 1972, based on the principle of natural prolongation. Since then the development of the 1982 UNCLOS, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, favoured the median line boundary as advocated by Timor-Leste. Timor-Leste initiated a conciliation procedure under UNCLOS in April last year relating to the maritime boundaries. A conciliation commission consisting of five members appointed by both Australia and Timor-Leste was empowered to make recommendations but not legally binding orders. Although this was the first occasion such a commission met under the UNCLOS framework, Dr Jose Ramos-Horta, who I had the pleasure of catching up with during his recent visit to Hobart last month, was extremely complimentary of the commissioners. It was chaired by His Excellency Peter Taksoe-Jensen, the Danish Ambassador to India, with Dr Rosalie Balkin, Judge Abdul G Koroma, Professor Donald McRae and Judge Rudiger Wolfrum. I would like to echo the praise of Dr Ramos-Horta for the commissioners' efforts in bringing the dispute to an end. As shadow foreign minister, Penny Wong, said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">has strained our bilateral relations and has gone on too long.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, should the final agreement and the gas field prove as supportive to its development plans as hoped, Timor-Leste could reap the economic benefits of an area containing oil and gas deposits worth an estimated $50 billion. I've tabled a motion in the Senate urging the Turnbull government to adhere to and implement, in good faith, the terms of this landmark agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is committed to multilateralism and a rules based international order. We believe all nations benefit from abiding by international norms. If we want to insist that other nations play by these rules, we should adhere to them as well. I believe instruments such as UNCLOS contribute to the maintenance of that order by facilitating peaceful resolutions of disputes between states, like other maritime border disputes, and could play a vital role, particularly in the one in the South China Sea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Ramos-Horta commented that this agreement has the potential to resolve more than 40 years of tension and uncertainty between Australia and Timor-Leste and to serve as a catalyst for a new era of collaboration and cooperation. He was hosted in Hobart by Tasmanian Medical Volunteers and the East Timor Eye Program at the Hobart Eye Surgeons clinic on Saturday, 9 September. It was one of the most moving and motivating receptions I've ever attended. Dr Ramos-Horta is an extraordinary individual. He is one of the great figures of the Asia-Pacific, in this century and the last. He has been a strong supporter of eye health and treatment for people suffering from avoidable blindness in Timor-Leste for many, many years. A statistic that shocked me at the time was that over 13,000 people in Timor-Leste are needlessly blind, mostly due to cataracts, a condition that can be overcome with a simple operation that takes less than 20 minutes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The East Timor Eye Program was established in July 2000 by Dr Nitin Verma, the 2013 Hobart citizen of the year and a Tasmanian finalist in the 2013 Australian of the Year awards. Dr Verma is a humanitarian, a researcher, a teacher, a surgeon and a member of the Order of Australia. He's a partner in the busy Hobart Eye Surgeons clinic and the head of ophthalmology in the Royal Hobart Hospital. He is also the Honorary Consul of Timor-Leste.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The East Timor Eye Program works to assist to make Timor-Leste self-sufficient in the provision of eye care and works towards completely eradicating preventable blindness by 2020. Each year, eye teams travel to Timor-Leste on one- to two-week visits to distribute spectacles and perform consultations and operations. As Dr Ramos-Horta made clear, it is not only the eye care expertise that the volunteers bring to Timor-Leste that's important; it is the training they undertake and the skills they pass on and leave in Timor-Leste so the nation can autonomously deal with and prevent its own problems. It is the shocking beauty of watching people get to see again after simple cataract surgery that motivates Dr Ramos-Horta and Dr Verma in this work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australian surgeons and other professionals, many of whom are Dr Verma's colleagues from Hobart, have become regular volunteers, generally funding their own trips to Timor to treat patients and teach local health workers. It's such a wonderful thing that they do to give to the Timor people. They are some of the many wonderful people from Timor-Leste, Australia, New Zealand and around the world who are working so hard to make such vital contributions to the future of this new and tiny nation. On behalf of the Australian Senate, I want to express our gratitude to every one of those people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a strong interest in a prosperous and stable Timor-Leste. At the Hobart event, Dr Jose Ramos-Horta said—and I agree—that the next five years will be a key period for the growth of Timor-Leste both democratically and economically. Some weeks after the parliamentary election in July, a minority government has been formed. Parliamentarians from both opposition parties are being offered ministries in a government of inclusion, building on the consensus model of the previous government. It is a key moment for Timor-Leste's democratic consolidation, one of opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Timor-Leste still needs our support. It still needs Australia's support and hard work and the example of its people, and the humanitarian heroes from the East Timor Eye Program stand it in good stead. We are such close neighbours with such strong people-to-people links. Since Timor-Leste's independence in 2002, Australia has been its largest development partner. I hope this agreement will help to open up Timor-Leste's future as it steps forward into it. I know there are many people in Australia and all over the world who will always stand shoulder to shoulder with the Timorese people, and I wish Timor-Leste well into the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245759" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:27</span>):  I rise tonight to make a contribution, as I often do, about the future of regional Queensland. I'm the duty senator for Labor for the electorate of Capricornia in Central Queensland, and it's an area where I spend a significant amount of time. Both Central Queensland and regional Queensland as a whole have so much going for them. Regional Queensland is a true economic powerhouse. Whether it's mining, agriculture and other traditional industries like that—or, more recently, tourism, education services through some fine universities and vocational education institutions, health care and marine science—the range of industries and jobs available in regional Queensland is extremely diverse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, regional Queensland is home to some of the most pristine environments in Australia and the world. Whether we're talking about the Great Barrier Reef, the rainforests up the coastline of North Queensland, the gulf or the grasslands out west, we are truly blessed to have an environment as rich as we do in regional Queensland. Of course, whether we're talking about the major regional cities—places like Rockhampton, Mackay, Townsville and Cairns—or small outback towns, regional Queensland is distinguished by having very strong and supportive communities that bind together in difficult times and support each other through thick and thin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So regional Queensland has so much going for it, and I'm very proud, as a member of the Australian Labor Party, that we believe so strongly in our regions and that over many, many decades we have been strong supporters of our regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, I know that our friends in the Sydney branch of the Australian Labor Party dispute this, but we maintain to this day that the Australian Labor Party was born under a tree in western Queensland, in Barcaldine, so a commitment to regional Queensland and regional Australia is very deep within our bones. But, unfortunately, despite these many positives that lie ahead for regional Queensland, the area is being very badly let down by its members who represent it from the Turnbull government, the LNP members. These members are all different people but there's one thing that really binds them together and that is the fact that, as LNP members in Queensland, they talk big but they deliver little.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was saying yesterday that whether we're talking about The Nationals in other states or the LNP in Queensland, to their shame, they continue to represent nine of the poorest 10 electorates across Australia. They talk about this and wear it as a badge of pride. They don't admit that it's actually a sign of their failure. These are electorates that The Nationals and the LNP have represented across Australia year after year, election after election and decade after decade. And what have they got to show for it? Continued poverty, continued disadvantage and continued inequality, whether that be looking at the incomes that people are earning, whether that be about unemployment rates, whether that be about poor health outcomes or whether that be about lower levels of education that are delivered to people in regional Queensland and regional Australia. I am not saying that to pick on people in those communities. We think that regional Queensland is a wonderful place with strong economies, job opportunities, strong communities and a wonderful environment. But those communities are being held back in their development and in achieving a great quality of life by the incredibly poor political representation that they continue to get from the LNP and The Nationals in the rest of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even today with the Prime Minister's big announcement around energy, which we know was a complete flop and was a cave-in to Tony Abbott, regional Queenslanders are going to be some of the people who will be hurt most as a result of today's announcement. We know that the Prime Minister has ignored the advice of his Chief Scientist in not adopting a clean energy target, which the Prime Minister himself said would help to deliver lower power prices. So regional Queenslanders, as a result of this decision, are going to be paying higher power prices than they need to pay. But in addition to that, the job impacts on regional Queensland will be very stark. All up there are several renewable projects, mostly solar but other types as well, that are under construction and underway in regional Queensland. If you put all of those projects together, they'll be delivering around 1,000 jobs. They are exactly the kinds of jobs that are now at risk as a result of today's announcement by the Turnbull government. So yet again we have an example of the LNP out there pretending they're the friends of the regions and the friends of regional Queensland, but when they come down to Canberra they sell out to their Liberal Party mates from the North Shore of Sydney and deliver things that are actually going to make regional Queenslanders lives' worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a different approach. We want to get behind regional communities. We want to talk about the issues that are holding regional Queensland back. We want to listen to people in regional Queensland about what their concerns are and we want to come up with solutions for what those problems are to ensure that they have an even better quality of life than what they currently do. And that's why, a bit over a week ago, so many shadow ministers joined me in Rockhampton and across Central Queensland to get out and talk to Central Queenslanders, listen to what they want and come up with solutions for the problems that they are confronting. I'll run through a sample of the things we undertook over the course of that week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Monday, our Australian jobs task force visited the picket line of mining workers in Tieri. We know the industrial relations minister, Michaelia Cash, has had something to say about that picket line. But what you won't ever hear from her is any condemnation of the company there. Like so many mine companies around them, they are gradually getting rid of permanent workers and replacing them with short-term casual labour hire or contract workers. But Labor was out there talking to workers about what kind of industrial relations environment we need going forward to make sure that people in regional Queensland can continue to have secure, well-paid jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Tuesday, Catherine King, our shadow health minister, and the Medicare task force of Labor were out talking to drug and alcohol rehabilitation counsellors about the need for more rehabilitation services in an area which, unfortunately, is suffering from an increase in the use of ice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Wednesday, the shadow northern Australia minister, Jason Clare, and the shadow finance minister joined me and state representatives talking to tourism operators on Great Keppel Island about what support they needed, particularly from the government's failed Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund, to ensure that we can have more tourism developments and, therefore, more jobs in tourism on Great Keppel Island.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Thursday, the shadow regional communications minister, Stephen Jones, joined me in talking with a mum who is very representative of so many people in Central Queensland suffering from terrible NBN services. This woman can actually see NBN towers 300 metres from her own home. I might say that this was the site of a press conference conducted by the Minister for Regional Communications, Fiona Nash, and the local member, Michelle Landry. They turned up and did a press conference outside a brand new NBN tower and spruiked about what a great job they were doing. That NBN tower is still not even turned on. There's a tower there ready to service people in Central Queensland, but this government can't get it together to turn that tower on and provide the NBN to people all around it. We also met with many small businesses who are suffering from the shoddy rollout of the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Friday, the shadow agriculture minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, joined me to talk with representatives of the meat processing industry. Obviously, Rockhampton is the beef capital of Australia. That industry employs literally thousands of people right across Central Queensland. We were very pleased to do a tour and have a meeting with the meat processors and the workers at Thiess, and to meet with many of the cattle farming representatives as well to hear what they needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The week culminated on Saturday with the National Country Labor Forum, where shadow ministers and ALP members from across regional Australia came together and talked about what we need to do to improve the future of regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what regional Queensland needs. It doesn't need more excuses and more failures from the Turnbull government. They get out there and announce funds, announce structures and announce programs on a daily basis but actually seem completely incapable of delivering anything on the ground, whether it be the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund, which was announced two years ago and has not created one job or funded one project in regional Queensland, or so many other examples of funds which have failed to do what they needed. Regional Queensland deserves better than this. It's a great place with great people, but it needs a government that's going to get behind it. If the LNP is not prepared to do that, Labor is.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:37</span>):  You'd think it would be a simple statement of truth that if you're paid to lobby you're a lobbyist. But for some reason we have laws in this country that say night is day, black is white, east is west and people whose job it is to lobby aren't lobbyists. We have laws that say that you're only a lobbyist if you're a third party lobbyist. If Google hires your firm, you're a lobbyist; if Google hires you, you're not. If the Minerals Council of Australia hires your firm, you're a lobbyist; if the Minerals Council of Australia hires you, apparently you're not. If Coles, Woolworths, Westpac or Wesfarmers hires your firm, you are a paid lobbyist; if they hire you to lobby, pay you to lobby and expect you to lobby every day from here until the end of the world, under the law you are not a lobbyist; under the law, you're not anything; as far as the laws around lobbying go, you're not a lobbyist, so there aren't any.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's supposed to be a cooling-off period preventing ministers from becoming lobbyists within 18 months of losing their ministerial responsibilities. But because we define 'lobbyist' so narrowly and because the cooling-off period doesn't have any legal enforceability, we have no protections from improper influence at all. Any minister in the Turnbull government could resign their post today and sign a contract tomorrow with any company they liked. They'd go from minister to corporate lobbyist in a heartbeat, and they'd be absolutely untouchable. Their colleagues today would become their business opportunities for tomorrow—all within the rules and all within the law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what a surprise it is, then, that the secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet would find nothing wrong with what happened with Bruce Billson. Of course he was within the law. The law, if you can call it a law, is absolutely ridiculous. Let's remember what actually happened here. Bruce Billson was a minister, then he was a backbencher, then he was the Executive Chairman of the Franchise Council of Australia—except it's a bit messier than that. There's a bit more of an overlap than that. Bruce Billson was a member of parliament at the same time that he was Executive Chairman of the Franchise Council of Australia. What's the Franchise Council of Australia? It's an organisation that has been set up to lobby on behalf of its members. We don't call it a lobbying organisation, of course. It lobbies, but it's not a lobbying firm. It's set up exclusively to lobby, but that doesn't matter with the laws that we have. So we have a former minister who as minister was responsible for the Franchising Code of Conduct and who, within 18 months, became the head of an industry group designed to lobby the government of which he was still a member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He apologised and said it was a discourtesy to parliament. That was very big of him. I say that's not good enough. I say it shouldn't have happened in the first place, and I ask where his integrity was. Why would he have two jobs at the same time if he couldn't do both at the same time? If he was doing both at the same time, he had a clear conflict of interest and shouldn't have been allowed to continue to do that. The public says you serve the public interest. Special interest groups pay you to serve their special interests. You can't do both. There's no two ways about this: you can't do both. Except, because we have laws that don't work and protections that don't protect and safeguards that don't guard anything, you can do whatever the hell you want. The laws are broken and we should change them. That's what I plan to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight I released the Jacqui Lambie Network's plan to clean up Canberra. It starts with reform to the Lobbying Code of Conduct. When the Rudd government introduced the code in 2008, it was an attempt to regulate the way lobbyists work in Canberra. It didn't work, for a lot of reasons: it wasn't independent, it was full of loopholes and it couldn't be legally enforced. Now's the time to take another look at the Lobbying Code of Conduct and actually fix it. Here's how: we expand it, we legislate it and then we enforce it. We expand it by harmonising the parliament. How? We align the parliament sponsored-pass definition of 'lobbyist' with the code's definition of 'lobbyist'. We strengthen the code of conduct's post-separation employment restrictions for former ministers. We extend the post-separation employment restriction for former ministers from 18 months to five years, lining up with Canada, the European Union and the United States. We legislate the Lobbying Code of Conduct by turning it from a toothless feel-good instrument into a mandatory industry code governing everybody who lobbies federal government representatives: businesses, unions, NGOs and industry groups. Everyone who lobbies will be called for what they are, a lobbyist. We give the ACCC the power to police the mandatory industry code and make all of their decisions reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Then we enforce it by establishing a parliamentary integrity commissioner. That would be an important independent statutory body that would administer the register and report to the parliament. We give the commissioner the power to enforce the Statement of Ministerial Standards and provide advice to the government. Finally, we expand the Parliament House visitor pass register to include a field specifying on behalf of whom a visitor is visiting and we allow access to the register under freedom of information law. That is a short summary of a long process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This reform package is the product of extensive consultation across all sides of the political divide. It's taken a huge amount of time and energy and proposes the biggest shake-up of lobbying reform in a decade. They say sunlight is the best disinfectant. My plan breaks every window and kicks down every door and sheds more light on lobbying than has happened at any other time in Australia's parliamentary history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People elect Independents to the parliament to hold the parties to account. This policy is a demonstration of what Independents can do to make good on that promise. Bruce Billson didn't do the right thing, but he'll get away with it. He shouldn't, but he will. So will the next person to make the jump through the revolving door of political influence and so will the person after that and so will the person after that, and we'll just keep shaking our heads, saying something should really happen and looking to our major parties to lead the way. We'll wonder why nothing has changed, why this keeps happening and why major parties aren't leading the way in this field. Under my plan, we don't have to wait for them to lead; the ball is already rolling. You elected a Senate full of Independents, and because of you this is going to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month, my local newspaper, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Advocate</span>, reported that the Bandidos had moved into East Devonport. I can guarantee you that they did not move in to enjoy riding on Tasmania's beautiful country roads. No, the Bandidos have moved into the Devonport area to cause trouble, and I want to know what the federal and state governments are going to do about it. Clearly, Tasmania's new antifortification laws don't scare an international outlaw gang like the Bandidos. They are obviously not concerned about the security measures on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Spirit of Tasmania</span> because they didn't chose East Devonport because of its prestigious neighbourhood, I can assure you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to send a stronger message to organised crime gangs and tell them to, 'Get out!' We can do that if we take a national approach. If we don't, we'll just keep playing whack-a-mole. When one state gets tough on organised crime—guess what? The gangs are a bit smarter than what you take them for, and they will just move to the next state, which is exactly what is happening. And that will keep happening until the federal government gets a backbone and takes a lead on the matter. I mean, what are you scared of: some boys on bikes?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen firsthand the effect of organised criminal gangs on families. I have flashbacks every time a family member of someone who is caught up in drugs or the gang world pleads with me and asks me, in tears, to intervene and save the life of their child. But I can't, and that's because Australia doesn't have tough enough laws. These gangs aren't going to be scared off by antifortification laws, not when they have the money—your money—to set up elsewhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Organised crime must be addressed at COAG and the states must walk away with a comprehensive plan; otherwise, gangs will continue to prey on our children, seducing them with the idea of belonging, with drugs or with the opportunity to make big bucks. These gangs are stealing our children's futures. I was lucky. My son was in a position where he had no choice but to go into rehab, and he is now doing well. But that isn't every mother's story; most stories end up in heartbreak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Organised crime is very real and it impacts everyone. No-one is safe from the threat of bike gangs. Organised crime isn't isolated to disadvantaged communities; it's everywhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If that isn't enough to convince you of the seriousness of this matter then let me tell you how much organised crime costs the community in a language you understand. According to the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, organised crime cost this country $36 billion in 2013-14. Let me put it to you in another way: organised crime costs every single Australian around $1,500 every year. What could you do with an extra $1,500? What could Australia do with an extra $36 billion? Imagine what that money could do to our health system, to cut our energy costs and to support small businesses. Imagine the jobs that we could create which would actually be legal. Australia needs to band together as a community, grow a backbone, stand up to organised criminal gangs and pull up the welcome mat, because it is way overdue.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="CPR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RHIANNON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:47</span>):  I congratulate the New South Wales Teachers Federation on a significant outcome in a recent New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission settlement. This settlement secures continuity of learning for tens of thousands of school students through increased permanency of teacher employment in New South Wales public schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no coincidence that the public school sector of New South Wales is one of the only areas of employment in the last decade to record real wages growth and increased permanent employment. This sector is one of the most densely-unionised sectors of employment. Through their union, New South Wales's teachers were able to effectively argue the case for secure employment and to convince the New South Wales Industrial Commission that the department is indeed obliged, under its staffing agreement, to fill all unfilled permanent vacancies in all schools across the state. This has resulted in a settlement that we will see over the next six months: a minimum of 2,630 more permanent teaching positions appointed in New South Wales schools, with this total rising to meet the department's own calculation of no fewer than 4,451 unfilled permanent vacancies, as of mid-2017.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This decision has huge implications for education in New South Wales. Students in nearly 4,500 classrooms will now benefit from the continuity of learning that only a permanent teacher can provide. It means there are nearly 4,500 New South Wales families who will gain a permanent breadwinner, with all that entails for the stability of their family, their housing and their ability to plan for a bright future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to the myths and misrepresentations put out in the media and by the Liberal-Nationals, the highly unionised New South Wales teaching service is also recognised in Australia and internationally as highly effective, professional, engaged and of enduring quality. This, too, is no coincidence, as permanency of employment directly leads to the accumulation of skills, knowledge and experience, long-term career planning and a stable base from which teachers can pursue further education in their field through additional university or public TAFE qualifications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see another myth busted by this settlement, because it was achieved by an agreement between the union and the department to outcomes that are beneficial to students, to teachers and to New South Wales public education. This is an example of high union density leading to harmony, not conflict. The settlement requires the department's compliance in filling these vacancies, and the department, to its credit, has indicated its determination to do so in the settlement and to devote the necessary resources to comply with its obligations under the staffing agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is informative to contrast this with other sectors of employment in Australia, where we see low union density, stagnant wages growth, precarious employment and a decline in people's ability to pursue long-term plans for their family and their career. Low union density has led directly to an erosion of quality of life and quality of work for millions of Australians, and this is the Australia that the Liberal-Nationals are determined to create. The Turnbull government is using the ABCC in a suite of anti-union legislation to tie unions up in constant compliance requirements that increasingly limit active, constructive union work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can reverse this trend. The example provided by the New South Wales Teachers Federation in achieving such a significant outcome is a model for other sectors and for workers to join their union and to campaign together for greater permanency and wages growth. So a big congratulations to the New South Wales Teachers Federation for ensuring that nearly 4,500 teachers now have permanent jobs, for securing the education of thousands of students and for demonstrating the advantages of union density.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a society, we have made significant achievements in promoting the health and wellbeing of older Australians. There are, however, many areas where older people continue to face challenges. These include poverty for a growing number, age discrimination, ageism and social inclusion. The United Nations Principles for Older Persons have been developed and are supported by governments within Australia. These principles recognise rights of older persons to independence, participation, care, self-fulfilment and dignity. And there is also a growing global push for a binding international convention on the rights of older people that moves beyond a statement of desirable principles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, poverty rates for people over 65 are relatively low. However—and it's a big 'however'—there are significant problems. Less than 12 per cent of people over 65 fall below the poverty line. However, there is evidence of cumulative economic advantage and disadvantage throughout the life course. Thirty-six per cent of elderly single women and 30 per cent of elderly single men had spent between six and 10 years living in poverty in the decade 2001 to 2010. Relatively few are able to escape the cycle of poverty once established. While home ownership is relatively high among older people, those in rental accommodation are particularly vulnerable to poverty, particularly older women living alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With poverty comes deprivation. For example, 40 per cent of the lower income group could not make electricity or gas payments. Most routinely do without even essential services and material, like food. The number of people aged over 65 living in lower income rental households is projected to increase from 190,000 in 2001 to 419,000 in 2026. The greatest projected change is in the group 85 years of age and over, where estimated numbers are increasing from 17,300 to 51,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Older women are much more likely than men to face poverty and homelessness as they age in Australia. They are more likely than men to experience discrimination during their lifetime of employment, they are very likely to spend much of their retirement years without a partner and they are very likely to experience severe poverty in their old age. One study found that 51 per cent of older women over 85 live in or near poverty. There are several reasons for this associated with income and living alone. Older women are increasingly likely to live alone as they age. According to a recent analysis by the Australian Institute of Family Studies, among women the rates of living alone increase as they grow older but much more sharply than for men in older age groups. From the age of 50 onwards the chance of women living alone increases sharply, and from the age of 60 onwards that chance is much higher than for men. By age 80 and over, 40 per cent of women live on their own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Older women are more likely to have no or very limited superannuation, as superannuation only became compulsory only relatively recently. Attitudes to saving for retirement have changed for women but those over 50 are very likely to regard retirement savings as the husband's responsibility. The result is that many women accumulate substantially less superannuation than men, as contributions are usually linked to earnings. The male members of superannuation funds, for example, already enjoy assets almost three times greater than the female members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Divorce has a very detrimental effect upon a woman's future retirement income. Many women who are at home raising children or working in low-paid part-time jobs assume that they will enjoy a comfortable retirement because of their husband's superannuation. Despite legal protection, many women lose access to a husband's superannuation after divorce. Consequently, given an interrupted career history due to caring responsibilities and given a lack of retirement planning, a great many older women, including highly educated professional women, remain very vulnerable to poverty in old age.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ageism can be described as 'a process of systemic stereotyping or discrimination against people simply because they're older'. According to the Human Rights Commission, ageism is an entrenched feature of Australian society, with older individuals being lumped together or thought of as all being the same just because of their age. COTA, Australia's premier advocacy agency for older people, agrees with this view, describing ageism as 'endemic and pervasive in Australia'. Ageism can impact older Australians in many ways. For example, in the media and arts, images of older people are often negative, unattractive or stereotypical. The long-term impact can be serious in rendering older people invisible, useless and feeling like they're a burden on society. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the health system, certain symptoms in older patients, such as balance problems, memory loss and depression, can be dismissed from the outset as 'old age' instead of being viewed as potentially treatable health conditions. Age discrimination has been detected in assessing suitability for medical rehabilitation services, specifically for stroke and cardiac patients. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then there is access to employment. The attitudes of many employers to older workers is problematic. Access to training and professional development is often restricted or outright denied. The skills of our older people are frequently undervalued. The Australian Human Rights Commission has identified age discrimination as the foremost barrier to the workforce participation of mature-age workers. Women experience a double-whammy when it comes to employment discrimination, as they are regarded as less capable than older men. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In accessing affordable, safe and suitable housing, including public housing, the profile of older people experiencing homelessness is rapidly expanding, with an increasing number of old people, particularly women, becoming homeless after being evicted from what has been previously comparatively stable accommodation in the private rental market. Even those relatively affluent couples who have invested heavily in retirement village accommodation may find themselves severely impacted by unscrupulous developers, complex and inaccessible contracts and a variety of unregulated fees, including deferred fees. This is where you buy a unit at a retirement village at full price, but, when the time comes to sell, you have to pay the village owner a large percentage of what you get. There can also be ongoing maintenance fees that keep going when you die—and bonds. These various rorts may prevent people from moving, may destroy all financial resources of some older people and may lead their children to carry a huge financial burden after death. In the planning of public facilities, access to public transport, including safe bus stops and accessible vehicles, and location of services should take sufficient account of the needs of older people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as discrimination, many older people suffer exclusion and social isolation. There are multiple factors that cause older people to become socially isolated, including the loss of a partner, family members moving away, living in rural and remote areas, and chronic illness. As mobility becomes affected, access to social events becomes more limited. Age discrimination can intensify social isolation in a psychological sense. Elder abuse is defined by the World Health Organization as:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… a single, or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Elder abuse can take various forms, such as physical, psychological or emotional, sexual and financial abuse. It can also be the result of intentional or unintentional neglect. That's the WHO definition. Clearly, it is a human rights issues and reflects that a comprehensive set of strategies is needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a paradigm shift in the development of aged-care policies and programs. We should view older Australians not as a cost burden; we should view them instead as citizens who have the same human and citizenship rights as everyone else and as people who contribute greatly to family, to community and to broader society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Melbourne Cup is coming up. It's known as the horserace that stops a nation. Sadly, it also stops, as in kills, many horses. In 2013, Verema died. In 2015, Red Cadeaux died. In 2014, Admire Rakti died, and also Araldo. Between 650 and 960 racehorses are euthanased each year. Surely it is time we reassessed how we treat these animals. The racing year goes from 1 August to 31 July. In the racing year from 1 August 2016 to 31 July 2017, 137 racehorses died on Australian racetracks. Most causes of death on the racetrack are actually catastrophic limb injuries, with broken or fractured legs, backs, necks and pelvises. Torn muscles, tendons or ligaments also occur. I just named some of the horses that have died. You might remember the horrific photographs of the horse with its broken leg flapping around as it tried to walk on three legs just before it was killed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the tragedy for so many of the horses, but there are many other ways that they die. Ninety per cent of race or event horses haemorrhage into their lungs, and 50 to 60 per cent bleed into their windpipes. Racehorses are fed concentrated high-protein grains to maximise performance. However, that's not how horses evolved. They evolved grazing on grasses, often eating dry grass, hay and other fibrous food. This change in diet, which is linked with maximising racing performance, because they're now being fed high-protein foods, causes ulcerated stomachs in stabled horses. So clearly the change in diet is cruel. Eighty-six per cent of racehorses suffer ulcerated stomachs and many suffer deep bleeding ulcers within eight weeks of starting race preparation and going onto the special diets. Gastric ulceration occurs in up to 93 per cent of thoroughbred horses. This increases to 80 to 100 per cent as training increases and racing commences. Dorothy Ainsworth, a veterinary research clinician and professor of large animal medicine at Cornell University, has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… it is becoming apparent that racing and strenuous exercise, the actual substance of being a racehorse, is exactly what is putting these horses at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The information I have given about the haemorrhaging and the gastric ulcers comes from a variety of physiology journals and horseracing journals that have documented these problems. There is a very common injury for horses, and one that regularly leads to death. It's well known that once a horse is injured—has broken its leg—it's not going to recover. That is a huge problem, and I understand that it's the fourth-most-common cause of death in horses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So on the first Tuesday of November, Melbourne Cup day, let's think of the horses. The level of cruelty is extreme, and surely it's at least time that we asked ourselves, 'Does it have to be so extreme?'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="195565" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:05</span>):  Every summer, Japan sends its fishing fleet and harpoon boats to the Southern Ocean to kill our whales. And in every Christmas break, I've pressured governments to act. I've done what I can as a senator to raise the profile of this issue. I've also often felt a sense of sadness and frustration that so little can be done, this anger only being tempered by respect and gratitude that Sea Shepherd are on the job, doing what they can to disrupt this barbaric practice. And other activists and so many organisations all around the world are working hard to bring Japanese whaling to an end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many other Australians, I was shocked when Neptune's Navy—Sea Shepherd—announced just recently that they would be unable to continue their Southern Ocean campaign this summer due to recent developments, with the Japanese fishing fleet upgrading their technology and having been given new powers by the Japanese parliament that essentially militarise their whaling fleet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Few environmental issues unite, not divide, Australians more than whale conservation and opposition to continued barbaric whaling practices in our Southern Ocean. While previous governments have made Australia's opposition to Japanese whaling clear and have successfully pursued Japan in international courts, ultimately this has not ended Japanese whaling. In fact, recent legislation in the Japanese parliament suggests it has only spurred them on to greater efforts to legitimise and defend their whaling interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what do you do when you care deeply about an issue, when you know that nine out of 10 Australian people agree with you and your sense of frustration only grows when your one hope for direct action to save the lives of whales vanishes? You really only have one choice: you take action yourself. You use all the means at your disposal and explore different strategies and ways to prevent whaling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One strategy I hadn't tried was actually to go to Japan myself. It has been put to me by activists and others experienced in Japanese politics that, while Australia and other nations need to keep up diplomatic and other pressure on Japan as much as possible, the best chance—and some say the only chance—of stopping Japanese whaling is the Japanese people themselves. So, while I can't go to the Southern Ocean every summer myself, I sure as hell can go to Japan and see what can be done. I can listen respectfully and learn, build alliances and look for new proactive ways to convince the Japanese to end whaling in the Southern Ocean. I wanted to see for myself what it was all about and what makes the Japanese so determined to hunt and kill magnificent creatures like whales—mammals that are so important to our healthy oceans—and risk their reputation in the face of so much international condemnation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's odd that no Australian politician has done this before, one-on-one—go up and lobby the Japanese directly, and engage with their domestic political and campaign landscape. Considering the millions of Australians who care deeply about healthy oceans and want to see an end to cruel and unnecessarily whaling, it was worth at least a try. And I want to point out and make it very clear this trip was self-funded. I paid for this trip myself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had meetings directly with pro- and anti-whaling politicians, with a number of NGOs and activists, with Japanese fisheries experts and with the Japanese Greens. I also gave a speech on my views at the independent Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan in Tokyo. My speech and a video of the views I expressed that day—comments I made on climate change as well as on whaling and the impacts on the Great Barrier Reef—can be accessed directly on my Facebook page. I am pleased to be able to say tonight that I felt it was all well worth the effort. I met many amazing people, I learned a great deal and I'm optimistic enough that there is a potential way forward to plan a second follow-up trip.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest question I was looking for answers for was put to me by Fran Kelly on Radio National on the morning of my Press Club speech. The question she put to me was: why are the Japanese so stubbornly resisting the international community and risking condemnation in pursuit of a practice that's both uneconomic and requires tens of millions in dollars of subsidies per annum—a practice that flies in the face of the rising unpopularity of whale meat consumption in Japan? Why? What is driving this? My first insights into answers to these questions was from a meeting with the NDP government's former environment minister and current chief director of the committee of the environment, Mr Tomokatsu Kitagawa. While we had a very friendly and respectful meeting, I did not expect Mr Kitagawa to put the case so strongly that their whaling endeavours were essential for scientific research purposes, including even to help better understand the bio impacts of marine microplastics—something no doubt he had researched on my background and knew I was interested in. I thought it was an argument of convenience rather than a genuinely-held view and I let Kitagawasun know this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also put forward to him directly the view that for non-lethal research methods, much of this work conducted by teams of Tasmanian scientists can do the job just as well and that this is well proven. He replied, 'We must respectfully disagree.' While it didn't seem worth crashing the meeting over this disagreement, because we also needed to have a productive discussion on climate change, the impacts of burning coal and coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, it was fascinating that even the Japanese arguments for lethal research, which have been thoroughly debunked by the International Court of Justice and other members in the international whaling commission, are still being peddled and still persist as their official line for their continuation of whaling in the Southern Ocean.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This response seemed less surprising to me once I had my second meeting with anti-Southern-Ocean-whaling activist Taro Yamamoto. Taro Yamamoto is a celebrity politician, actor, surfer, anti-nuclear activist and a bit of a rebel in the Japanese political landscape, who seems to cut through in the multidimensional alliance based politics of the Japanese Diet. While I met with several Japanese politicians on my trip, none of them were like Mr Taro Yamamoto. Before he was an activist and a politician, Taro was an actor. He starred as Shogo Kawada in a Japanese cult movie, Kinji Fukasaku's 2000 film, <span style="font-style:italic;">Battle Royale</span>, a major influence on Quentin Tarantino that also inspired the movie <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hunger Games</span>. Taro became an anti-nuclear activist after the Fukushima disaster. He broke all the protocols when he approached the Emperor of Japan to hand him a letter on the issue of shutting down nuclear power in Japan. That's just one of the many things we had in common. I have previously done something similar when I handed a personal letter from Sea Shepherd founder Paul Watson to the Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, when he was in Australia for an official function in 2014. The other thing we have in common is that we're both keen surfers and lovers of the ocean.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Taro is a rare and brave voice speaking out against whaling in Japan. He is one of the only politicians to vote against recent legislation in the Japanese Diet, new laws that allow the military to protect whaling ships and bring back full commercial whaling in Japan. He explained to me that whaling is propagated by powerful vested interests within and without the Japanese parliament. But the underlying reason for this was simple and also somewhat surprising. Why are there such strong, powerful vested interests in Japan in favour of seeing whaling continue, against all international condemnation? Taro's view, which he explained to me when we were sitting in his office discussing this over some green tea, was that this is all about, to use his own words, machismo, appearing macho as a fillip to the nationalists within Japan. Taro explained to me that, since World War II, Japan has not been able to have a navy except for self-defence, but the fisheries department sits outside the allowed defence forces, and it's an opportunity to flex their muscles and show the world and the nationalists back home that Japan can project its power and obtain protein on and across the high seas. He told me that harpooning a whale is also considered a manly thing to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My concerns, expressed at the foreign correspondents club, that Japan is perceived through recent legislation to have militarised its fishing fleet—and by that I mean with new military technology, weapons and the powers to search, seize and imprison in the so-called defence of its fishing fleet—fitted this explanation. This is a worry, given that Japan, an important ally of ours, must play a leadership role in our region and is not in a position to have it both ways when it, for example, accuses China of ignoring a global rules-based order or the rules of the sea or of using its navy to accompany and protect illegal fishing efforts in disputed territories. Japan's criticism of the International Court of Justice's jurisdiction and competence in declaring previous whaling efforts in the Southern Ocean illegal has similar worrying echoes of China's refusal to accept international rulings on navigation rights in the South China Sea or in disputed territories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But back to Taro. We obviously need more politicians like Taro in Japan so we can put an end to whaling in the Southern Ocean, if this is going to come from the Japanese people themselves. This would be no mean feat, given he is one of but two politicians who recently opposed pro-whaling legislation in a parliament of 717 members. I have invited Taro to Australia to meet with Australians, including the Australian media, and to go surfing with me in Tassie, although he made it clear he would prefer to go somewhere warmer like the Gold Coast—but we'll see. I hope that we can raise his profile internationally and show the world and other politicians in Japan that they have support from many, many quarters all around the globe to end Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean. It would also be very good for the Australian people to realise that not all Japanese support whaling and not all Japanese politicians support the powerful vested interests within Japanese bureaucracies and political circles that continue to propagate whaling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In other meetings, with NGOs and experts, I was also led to believe that there are others who may oppose whaling in the Japanese parliament, but they are currently tied by numerous political alliances and had to vote for this legislation. Given Japan is currently in election mode—in fact, Prime Minister Abe called a snap election while I was in Japan, because his approval rating shot up like a rocket on the back of the North Korean crisis—I hope that a new parliament may bring new opportunities to continue to build alliances to oppose whaling in the Southern Ocean.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were a number of other useful insights I gleaned from my meetings, including that the Japanese people don't know much at all about their government's whaling program and international opposition to their government's whaling program. This means, unfortunately, that it's not a big political issue. In fact, it's not much of an issue within Japan at all. The lack of education and awareness is obviously worrying, but it also presents an opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also made clear to me that whale meat consumption is still declining in Japan. It is rare for people to eat whale meat, and most sectors of the community don't consume it at all. The long-term cultural links to the consumption of whale meat are through localised and near-shore indigenous whaling, especially on the northern island of Hokkaido. It seems that there were no long-term cultural links to whaling in the Southern Ocean. Japan kills thousands of whales and dolphins in its backyard each year through fishing nets and other programs. This is all sold on local markets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I learnt that whale tourism is increasing, which is a good sign. I'm hopeful that will help promote whale conservation and show that whales can be pro-jobs and pro-Japan. But I'm told that some whale tourism operators offer whale meat to people on their tours. The idea of going on a whale watching tour to see the majestic animals up close and chomp down on a whale steak is a confronting thought for me, as I'm sure it would be for many Australians. Nevertheless, I'm hopeful that we may see some cooperative activity with the Japanese to continue to promote whale conservation through whale watching tours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also learnt that younger Japanese people are less prone to support the continuation of whaling than older generations. Given all these factors, there is hope amongst local campaigners that in the next decade or so Japan may eventually abandon its whaling programs. Another issue I'm well aware of is that the Japanese people resent being told what to do by foreigners. However, as they're conscious of their reputation, it's important to keep up international pressure on this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to finish by thanking all those groups and individuals who helped me, advised me, listened to me, met with me and taught me much that I needed to know. I especially thank Tristan Koens, Kazutaka Sakurai and Claire Walsh, from DFAT and the Australian embassy; Chung Hyon Suk and Khaldon Azhari, from the Foreign Correspondents' Club at Yurakucho Denki in Tokyo; Akiko Kando and Risa Kumano, for interpreting my many meetings; and the others from the Greens Japan with whom I was lucky enough to spend a whole afternoon talking about this issue and the importance of Japan's role in global climate negotiations. I would also like to thank Nanami Kurasawa, from IKAN, who has devoted most of her life in a country like Japan to conserving whales and dolphins, against all the odds. She is a lovely elderly lady, with whom I enjoyed spending a full hour. My Japanese is terrible, and her English wasn't that great, but we managed to get across most of the key points. I was extremely grateful, as she travelled so far just to meet with me. I would like to also recognise Peter Hammarstedt and Jeff Hansen, from Sea Shepherd, who also suggested that I should go to Japan. They let me know that they would never go because they probably wouldn't make it out of there if they did. I would like to also shout out to Heiwa Hasegawa, the senior fisheries consultant at AHK; Patrick Ramage, from the International Fund for Animal Welfare, who gave me nearly an hour of his time advising me on my speech or, I should probably say, helping me vet my speech; and Darren Kindleysides, from the Australian Marine Conservation Society, who also provided invaluable advice. Lastly, a big shout out to the crew at Greenpeace Japan, especially Tamara Stark, Kana Thorpe, Wakao Hanaoka and Sashiko Okada, who presented to me and provided a venue for my many other meetings. It was a worthwhile experience and I'll be going back to Japan.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee: <span style="font-style:italic;">Design, scope, cost-benefit analysis, contracts awarded and implementation associated with the Better Management of the Social Welfare System initiative</span>.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government continues to focus on the importance of protecting the integrity of the Australian welfare system through a fair and reasonable process. With $170 billion of welfare payments made in 2015-16 the Australian Government has a responsibility to make sure people are paid the right amount.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government increasingly uses technology to engage with people in line with contemporary social norms. The Australian Government will continue to transform service delivery, so interactions can be undertaken through easy-to-use, secure and integrated digital channels.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government's response is structured to include an opening preamble statement, findings by the independent Commonwealth Ombudsman followed by a response to the Chair's Report recommendations in the groups aligned with the themes as presented in the Report.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In line with community expectations about fairness, the Australian Government has developed a number of measures relating to the integrity of welfare payments to ensure people receive what they are entitled to and support is provided to those who need it most. Compliance activities are designed to protect the integrity of health, welfare and child support payment systems and to ensure the welfare system is fit for purpose and able to support people into the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Data-matching, sending letters and assessing and calculating differences in income and payments has been part of welfare compliance activities since the 1990's. What has changed was the introduction of the online self-service portal. The introduction of this online portal did not change how data-matching was undertaken or the way income was assessed and differences calculated. The online portal was developed with the intention to allow people the opportunity to review, update and confirm their information at a time convenient for them, quickly and simply.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government acknowledges the thorough investigation and report into the online system by the independent Commonwealth Ombudsman in April 2017, which recommended constructive and practical enhancements, which were agreed to in full by the Department of Human Services and have already been largely implemented.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Ombudsman's investigation found that it is entirely reasonable and appropriate to ask customers to explain discrepancies following data matching. It also points out that PAYG data matching activities have been conducted since 2004, with the methodology for averaging income in the absence of detailed information being in place since the 1980's.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Ombudsman investigation also made the finding that if the customer is able to collect the income information required and enter it properly into the system the online system was capable of accurately calculating the debt. It also found that the business rules in the online system that support the debt calculation are comprehensive and accurately capture the legislative and policy requirements.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Ombudsman investigation noted that the debt recovery fee is no longer applied automatically where there is no contact from the customer, or the customer responds that they had personal factors which affected their ability to accurately declare their income.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Ombudsman investigation identified that initial messaging to customers through letters and the online system was unclear. It also identified that overall communication with the online system has subsequently improved. For example, letters now include, in bold writing, the dedicated compliance number to call if people required further assistance and the customer no longer needs a myGov account to access the online system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Ombudsman investigation noted that the online system is now directed to people who have relatively simple employment circumstances. It also noted that all recipients can get assistance to complete their review through the online system by calling the dedicated compliance telephone line.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Ombudsman's investigation pointed out that if more information was received at any time (either online, by phone or in person) debts could be reassessed in light of the new information.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government welcomed the opportunity to provide input into the inquiry, including through the Department of Human Services' submission, supplementary submission, and through responding to over 200 'Questions on Notice'.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to maintaining a strong social welfare safety net. This requires that there be integrity in the welfare system. Each person should receive exactly what they are entitled to, no more and no less. This principle has been in place under successive Governments and has not changed.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government along with the Commonwealth Ombudsman acknowledge that communication issues with the initial rollout of the online system gave rise to potential confusion on the part of some recipients. As noted by the Commonwealth Ombudsman several changes have subsequently been made to improve the initial contact letters and messages within the online system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has carefully considered the findings and recommendations of the Senate Committee, and the information contained in submissions to the Committee. The Government agrees with the conclusions and recommendations in the Dissenting Report. In particular the Government agrees with the conclusion that input from some third parties was aimed solely at scoring political points.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government notes that a significant proportion of the statements relied upon as evidence in the Chair's report are not accurate. Many of the conclusions drawn in the Chair's report fail to take account of the detailed review undertaken by the independent Commonwealth Ombudsman, or account for the detailed information provided by the Department of Human Services in its submissions to the inquiry.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On this basis, the Government rejects the central conclusions and recommendations of the Chair's Report, especially the conclusion that the online system lacked procedural fairness. As the Ombudsman's investigation found it is entirely reasonable and appropriate to ask customers to explain discrepancies following data matching. Recipients are given a reasonable opportunity to provide information and explain discrepancies. Further, as noted by the Ombudsman review avenues are (and have always been) open to recipients.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I wish to bring to your attention the conduct of the Minister for Employment and the Attorney General, the result of which was to breach my privacy and the tabling of a Report in the Australian Senate, the contents of which I was neither aware nor had been given any opportunity to respond too. The unchallenged contents of the Report, in so much as they relate to me, have had the effect of seriously defaming me and causing me both considerable personal anguish and professional harm.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">1. On 30 May 2014 I made a complaint (the initial complaint) to the Fair Work Commission President about the Vice President, the Hon Michael Lawler, in the performance of his duties. The complaint was accepted pursuant to s 581A of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act 2009</span>. However after one year, and being led to believe no investigation had commenced, I took my complaint pursuant to s 641A of the Act (at the suggestion of the FWC President) to the Minister for Employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">2. My complaint was made under cover of "private and confidential" and, as a result of a request from the Minister for Employment's Chief of Staff, I gave an undertaking to treat the process of the investigation with confidence. I understood that to be a reciprocal arrangement including that my name would be kept private.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">3. On 19 October 2015 the Minister for Employment announced, by-way of media release, the establishment of an inquiry into complaint(s) about the Vice President, the appointment of an eminent retired Federal Court Judge and the Terms of Reference for the inquiry. The Minister named me publically, (for the first time) in the first of the six Terms of Reference. Neither the Minister for Employment nor the Attorney General discussed with me the decision to publically name me. There was no necessity to name me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">4. The Ministers for Employment had both publically and privately given me an undertaking that I would be provided with procedural fairness as part of the inquiry process. Despite this undertaking, at no time was I contacted by the investigator, the Ministers, or any of their office or Departmental staff. On two occasions I wrote to the investigator and requested to be given the opportunity to speak to the inquiry. Neither request was acknowledged prior to publication.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">5. In the absence of a response from the investigator I forwarded submissions to him based on my understanding of the Terms of Reference. At all relevant times I was unaware that the Vice President had, as a matter of fact, responded to my initial complaint (addressed to the FWC President) in a detailed 6 page letter written 10 months after the events complained off. In that letter the Vice President made numerous serious and false allegations against me. Neither the FWC President, the Ministers nor the investigator advised me of this letter, much less gave me an opportunity to respond to the allegations made therein. I only became aware of the allegations as a result of the Report being tabled and subsequently published online by the Australian newspaper on 15 March 2016.</span>
