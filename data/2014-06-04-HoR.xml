                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian apprenticeships are a critical component in ensuring the Australian economy has all the skills it requires for future competitiveness. I have to say, Madam Speaker, how important this is in improving the competitiveness of Australian industry right across the board. It is a great opportunity for companies to take advantage of apprenticeships and improve their productivity, but, of course, the goal is to ensure that apprentices are able to gain the skills that they will need for a long and successful career and profession of their choosing. For the individuals who undertake them, apprenticeships also provide a valuable pathway into long-term employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of us see a skill and a trade as equal and as important as a degree at university, and we as a government will do everything we can to ensure that those opportunities are made available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know around 20 per cent of trade apprentices drop out by the end of their first year and, in fact, 30 per cent by the end of the second year; and that is an opportunity lost. Apprenticeships provide an opportunity to secure a career and it does not mean they will be in that career all their lives, but they miss the opportunity of that first step towards employment and long-term ability to earn a wage. Despite promising employment prospects and earning potential, many young people find the first few years of an apprenticeship financially difficult. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is taking action to support Australian apprentices when they need it most—to help them complete their apprenticeship and deliver these valuable skills to the economy. The Trade Support Loans Bill 2014 introduces and underpins the Trade Support Loans to provide assistance to Australian apprentices from 1 July 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trade Support Loans are concessional, income contingent loans, which function in a similar manner to FEE-HELP loans received by university students, and provide for up to $20,000 over four years directly to apprentices undertaking an apprenticeship in a priority occupation or qualification. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Implementation of the bill is estimated to have an impact on fiscal balance of $439 million over the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To encourage apprentices to complete their training, the loan amount received by an apprentice will be reduced by 20 per cent when they successfully complete their training. This is an incredibly important part of this initiative. It says to apprentices: 'Complete what you are setting out to do and we will provide you with a 20 per cent discount on the debt you accumulate. That is to say that we place a great deal of importance on you finishing your trade. There is no point in getting halfway through something and giving up. We know it is difficult and we know you need support. We know that this support is what you require.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The goal is as much to get the apprentice to finish their trade training as it is to support them during that training. By providing a 20 per cent discount, the government is basically offering them a $4,000 gift—their debt is reduced by $4,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trade Support Loans will be available to apprentices in occupations and qualifications on the priority list that I will determine as the minister. The priority list will include traditional trades such as electricians, plumbers and carpenters whose highly skilled occupations significantly contribute to productivity and to the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the opportunity to address the HIA conference a few weeks ago on the Gold Coast, and they were insistent that their apprentices be included in this scheme. I am pleased to say that in the case of electricians, plumbers and carpenters that they are, because that industry wants to have the young people of today turned into the tradespeople of the future. They want to stand behind them all the way. They want to see the government doing that. In particular, they want to incentivise those trade trainees to complete their trade so that they are there to provide the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The loans will be repayable at the same income thresholds as Higher Education Loans Program loans for a university student, so apprentices do not have to repay any money until they are earning a sustainable income with repayments made through the Australian taxation system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apprentices will be required to opt in to the loans regularly. Unlike Tools for Your Trade, where the money was basically thrown at apprentices and there was no ownership or feeling of responsibility related to those payments, apprentices will actually have to sign up to these loans every six months. This will make sure that they are fully aware of what they are taking on. By doing this, the intention is to give them the opportunity to reassess their personal circumstances and make an informed decision about continuing to receive loans. This will reduce the risk of apprentices unintentionally accumulating large debts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To provide support where it is needed most the loans will be paid in monthly in arrears to a total of $8,000 in the first year, $6,000 in the second, $4,000 in the third and $2,000 in the fourth year of the apprenticeship. The loans are more heavily weighted to the first two years when support is needed most. We want to address these startling dropout rates for apprentices in their first and second years that I mentioned earlier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's future productivity and competiveness depend on a skilled and trained workforce. Learning a trade is invaluable to the individual, the community and the economy, but learning skills does not come cheaply. The measures in this bill will provide the regular financial support required for apprentices to complete their training and move into a paid job as quickly as possible. That is our goal: to get, particularly, young people, but all people who decide to take up a trade, through their training and into a job where they not only become a productive member of the economic community but they have the financial security that we want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By implementing Trades Support Loans, this government is actively contributing to improve the apprenticeship completion rate, currently around 50 per cent. Really, that is something that we must address. We must get that completion rate up. When an apprentice does not complete their training, there is a substantial loss of time and financial commitment as a result. This translates directly into lost opportunities for the economy because fewer skilled workers are available and fewer productive gains can be achieved without them. Ongoing support such as that provided by the government's Trade Support Loans will help mitigate these losses to apprentices, employers and the national economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will further the government's commitment to delivering highly-skilled individuals in priority trades where there are growing skills shortages, and will deliver the improved productivity and competitiveness that the Australian economy needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The best feature of these loans, of course, is that they are interest free. Interest free for the term of the loan, and we expect the term of the loan to be something like seven years, indexed each year by the rate of CPI. I know there are those who do not understand the difference between interest and CPI, but CPI is an adjustment for the cost of living. Interest is what you pay on money. So we are giving these loans out interest free, and the saving for an apprentice who, let us say, takes a couple of years to get to the earning threshold before they start repaying it over five years, as against a commercial loan—were they able to get an unsecured commercial loan—that they may have to take out to buy a motor car so they can get to work or pay for whatever they need to to sustain themselves during their traineeship, is at least $8½ thousand. In fact, if you were using real figures it is probably closer to $10,000. But let us take a conservative number: if you add the $8½ thousand to the $4,000, this is now worth to the apprentice in training some $12½ thousand, or more than double the tools for the trade. We are confident this initiative will not only help young people in particular get through the challenge of working in their apprenticeship and completing their training but also get them into productive work.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former Labor government encouraged this poor behaviour by weakening the rules regarding the application of penalties for serious failures.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the changes introduced by Labor allowed people to waive the penalties for a serious failure simply by doing additional activities such as more intensive job search.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2012-13, there were 1,718 serious failures for refusing a job and, of these, the penalty was waived in 68 per cent of cases.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that same year, there were 25,286 serious failures for repeated noncompliance and of these, the penalty was waived in 73 per cent of cases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And of those waived, nearly one-third were for a job seeker's second or third episode of noncompliance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These penalties were waived not because the job seekers were vulnerable or the jobs were unsuitable, but simply because the job seeker elected to do an intensive activity instead.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ability to continually waive the penalty means that job seekers who commit a serious failure can avoid the financial consequences of their actions, and continue to receive income support, despite their poor behaviour.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that there are stronger deterrents in our system for those job seekers who abuse the system.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will ensure that the existing financial penalties for more serious failures are applied more rigorously and in keeping with community expectations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will remain the case that job seekers will not be forced to take work that is clearly beyond their work capacity and that their individual circumstances, such as homelessness, will still be taken into account.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the changes introduced by Labor also allowed this penalty to be waived through participation in intensive activities.</span>

I do so as a member of parliament but also as shadow minister for ageing. We know that this is a particular challenge in the aged-care sector. We have about 350,000 workers in the aged-care sector—doctors, nurses, allied health professionals—and by 2050 we will need a million or more people working across that sector, so it is crucial that we get the health workforce right. At Federation about four per cent of Australians were over 65 years of age; currently 14 per cent are over 65. By 2050, at the latest, it will be 25 per cent. Dementia is a major problem facing this country. We currently have about 300,000 people suffering from dementia and we will have nearly a million by 2050. More doctors, more nurses, more allied health professionals and more carers will be required to meet those challenges. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have many ups and downs with respect to workforce development but, when the former Labor government was first elected in November 2007, about 74 per cent of Australians were suffering as a result of a workforce shortage with respect to general practitioners. So we set about trying to address this issue. Sadly, the legislation before this House, which abolishes Health Workforce Australia, is a retrograde step with respect to getting rid of that cycle of boom and bust in the development of the workforce. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health workforce planning is absolutely crucial. It is essential for the demographic challenges we face in the future across the health sector and across the aged-care sector. The crucial need for more funding for health and aged care was recognised by the Queensland Treasurer yesterday in his budget speech in the House in George Street in Brisbane. He actually mentioned the fact that the current federal government is 'turning its back on the challenges of health funding.' He said, 'The federal government thinks that the states can survive with less' and we see in this legislation before the House that the government thinks that workforce development can survive with less as well. This is a tragedy and a shame. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After the federal election last year, we saw the first hint of the Abbott government having a closer look at HWA and other health agencies when the now health minister said ominously on Sky's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Agenda</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we want to be complemented by the Commission of Audit, but I’ve already started to look at the composition of some of those agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At Senate estimates on 20 November 2013 the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Nash, confirmed that HWA was under a funding freeze which affected its support for clinical placement funding. But it was not until the Abbott government finally released National Commission of Audit report—delayed surreptitiously and obviously until after the Griffith by-election and the WA Senate re-run were over—that it became clear that HWA's days were numbered. The Commission of Audit argued that there were too many government bodies in Australia and that this leads to duplication and overlap, unnecessary complexity, a lack of accountability, the potential for uncoordinated advice and avoidable costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission recommended that five of the 22 agencies within the health portfolio be consolidated into the Department of Health. Shamefully and tragically, Health Workforce Australia was one of those agencies. Apparently the commission believed it was appropriate that HWA be amalgamated and considered a clinical training unit. So it was no surprise that in the budget we saw this vital agency abolished by the Abbott government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government claims that getting rid of HWA is a simple streamlining of officialdom. It is simply untrue. It is instructive to recall, as I said, the state of the Australian health system we inherited in 2007 after 11 years of neglect from the Howard government. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare made it crystal clear on the eve of that federal election that the Howard government had abdicated its responsibilities by cutting funding consistently compared to the states and territories across the board, particularly in health and hospital funding, and in primary health care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time that Labor came to power in 2007, Australia was experiencing a grave shortage of doctors, nurses and other health professionals. This was keenly felt in my community where the then Ipswich and West Moreton division of general practice had reported a shortage of doctors and nurses after a study on the health issues in my community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report indicated that in the Ipswich region there was one GP for every 1,609 people. Worryingly, the report suggested this problem was likely to worsen as this workforce aged, and many local doctors were reaching retirement age. Within five years we would have a critical shortage of GPs at the front line of health services in the Ipswich and West Moreton region. The report highlighted some of the major health challenges in the areas as preventable and chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease—the challenge of smoking rates and alcohol abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget cuts funding for preventative health strategies, cuts and abolishes so many agencies dealing with those problems, including the one that is before the chamber today—the workforce agency that deals with the development and planning for our future workforce challenges—is a backward step. It will leave that obligation to the states and territories. It is an abdication of national responsibility and is a federalist model gone mad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Howard government left us with that cycle of boom and bust. The problems were identified by the Productivity Commission in its 2005 report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">health workforce</span>. The commission recognised that there were health workforce shortages across the country and that some shortages may be potentially short term—for example, shortfalls in nursing and allied health professionals could be rectified relatively quickly, but others were long term such as retention and re-entry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These shortages remain persistent, and the commission confirmed what Australians in rural and regional areas, such as my area, knew already: that they were being affected badly by the shortfall.  As the report neatly put it:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In particular, apart from nurses, the relative number of health professionals diminishes for communities located further away from major centres. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">referring to places like Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the area of education and training, the commission referred to 'rigidities, fragmentation and disconnects in the system.' The report highlighted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a lack of coordination between health planners and those responsible for allocating the number of university places across the various health professional areas, resulting in gaps between health service needs and the numbers of appropriately trained professionals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the commission was scathing about what had happened under the Howard government, and we saw that in practice in my community. The commission was quite clear about one of the major reasons for the health workforce shortage. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The health workforce is planned, educated, deployed, funded and regulated by a myriad of different public and private entities. This can be advantageous in a number of respects. For example, it provides for the development and application of specialised knowledge in specific areas.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But the number of entities involved, and especially the division of responsibility for the various parts of the health workforce system between and within governments, results in conflicting objectives, inefficiencies and cost and blame shifting </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what we are going to experience and see in the future with this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this time health workforce planning was the domain of two committees: the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee which was responsible for medical workforce planning; and the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council responsible for non-medical workforce planning, including nursing and allied health. So it was a hodgepodge—an alphabet soup. The Productivity Commission recommended the Labor government's commitment, strategy and funding, and the creation of Health Workforce Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Faced with these challenges, we set about doing it. In a national partnership agreement we directly committed $1.38 billion to a package and the states and territories put aside $540 million. We introduced the Health Workforce Australia Bill in 2009, fairly soon after we are elected, to establish this new agency. It was agreed across COAG—Labor and Liberal states and territories agreed to this. The stakeholders expressed some concerns at the time, and we responded by accepting amendments to the bill so that the functions of the agency would not include responsibility for the accreditation of clinical education and training. We made amendments; we listened to the stakeholders. We put people such as medical academics, nurses and experts in rural recruitment and rural workforce in the agency. We did that in consultation with the states and territories. They were precisely the kinds of experts you would want and expect to have in an agency that deals with health workforce planning. We acted in response to the need of the Australian population. We did it on the recommendation of the Productivity Commission and we did it with the concurrence, consent, approval and approbation of the states and territories. Through this legislation this government is doing exactly the opposite. The work that has been done by Health Workforce Australia is crystal clear—evidence based health workforce planning, capacity building, targeted reforms, innovation and reform of the health workforce in this country, international recruitment and retention programs—the list goes on and on. We received an interim program report from them for approval by AHMC. We announced further funding of $425 million for clinical training and we provided it for 83 agencies across 470 projects on workforce planning, for everything from simulated learning environments to integrated regional clinical training networks to clinical supervision projects—all with the concurrence of the states and territories. Health Workforce Australia produced a groundbreaking report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Health </span><span style="font-style:italic;">workforce </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2025</span>, analysing trends, providing recommendations, setting forth strategies. We listened to what they had to say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It takes no imagination to understand why those opposite want to get rid of this. They say they are in favour of good evidence based policy but with this legislation they are showing exactly the opposite. They are going back to the pre-Rudd government period. They going back to the mid-2000s, when there were ups and downs in workforce development. What the government are doing has been criticised by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. Its president, Dr Liz Marles, has been very critical. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Investment in a well-trained general practice workforce is the key to delivering a high quality, cost efficient and accessible healthcare system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The chair of the Public Health Association labelled the plan to get rid of the agency 'short-sighted'. Former president of the AMA Dr Steve Hambleton reported that at a meeting with the minister on 9 October 2013 he had:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… emphasised the important contribution the HWA had made to improved workforce planning, and the need for such work to continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Abbott government are continuing regardless. They are not listening to the stakeholders. They are not listening to the Productivity Commission. They are not listening to the states and territories. The minister obviously has not read the Productivity Commission's 2006 report <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">health workforce</span>, which recommended the creation of HWA. He may not have read the report <span style="font-style:italic;">Health </span><span style="font-style:italic;">workforce </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2025</span>. He is certainly not listening to the states and territories in relation to this. This is a short-sighted, ideological decision made because they do not like anything that involves the word 'planning'. As if the market works in this area! It does not work and has been shown not to work. Even Liberal states and territories agreed that what we did was the way to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />This legislation is not the way to go for the future development of our workforce. We face enough challenges in health and ageing in the future, in getting doctors, nurses and allied health professionals in our public and private hospital systems, in our nursing homes and in community care. You do not meet those challenges by abolishing the agency that is doing the planning, running the projects and doing the investment across this area. The government are not listening to the experts on climate change. They are not listening to the experts on education. They are not listening to the experts on health. They are certainly not listening to the experts across this field. They are not even listening to the states and territories owned and run by their own side of politics. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <a href="00BCM" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HENDY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:40</span>):  I rise to support the bill and to condemn the Labor Party for leaving a debt and deficit disaster requiring the necessary budget repair that we are now implementing. The measures in this bill, the Health Workforce Australia (Abolition) Bill 2014, form a part of a budget that is absolutely necessary to secure Australia's economic future. We need to put health funding on a sustainable footing. The budget outlines a clear plan—in fact, the only plan—that will address Labor's debt and deficit disaster. When the coalition last left office Australia had a $20 billion surplus and $50 billion in the bank. But over six years Labor squandered this and ran up five record deficits, with a further $123 billion in projected deficits and gross debt headed towards $667 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The antics of the Labor Party remind me of a quote heard now and again which is attributed to all manner of important people. It has been said that 'the American republic will endure until the day Congress discovers that it can bribe the public with the public's money'. I have seen this statement variously attributed to Benjamin Franklin, to US President John Adams and even to the famous French political commentator Alexis de Tocqueville. It turns out that the original statement was made by none of these notables but, rather, by a more obscure person named Alexander Fraser Tytler. Tytler is believed to have written that democracy 'can only exist until the majority discovers it can vote itself largess out of the public treasury. After that, the majority always votes for the candidate promising the most benefits, with the result that democracy collapses because of the loose fiscal policy ensuing'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not subscribe to such sentiments and I think the last election result proves that I am correct. The Australian public are much smarter than that. However, the Leader of the Opposition and his crew seem to work on the political theory that they just have to promise more spending and they will get away with it. What a remarkably craven bunch they are! As I have said, we are stopping the rot and putting health expenditure back on a sustainable footing—but, of course, no surprise, Labor is opposing this bill. In his budget in reply speech the Leader of the Opposition talked about meeting with a Queanbeyan family. Queanbeyan is a town in my electorate. The Leader of the Opposition scored an own-goal when referring to that family. He noted that 'like many Australians they aren't wealthy, they work hard to make ends meet'. But he went on to say 'they balance their budget'. Well, if it is good enough for that Queanbeyan family to balance their budget, maybe the Labor Party should listen to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Minister for Health said, this bill will streamline the delivery of health workforce policy programs by removing an unnecessary level of administration and bureaucracy. Over the last six years, the health bureaucracy continued to increase in size, with 21 stand-alone agencies operating outside the portfolio department. A bureaucracy of this size is unsustainable. Again, as the minister says, the coalition government is determined to get every possible dollar away from administration and bureaucratic processes and back into frontline services. This bill is part of that process. The government is committed to reducing red tape and duplication, delivering a smaller and more rational government footprint.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health Workforce Australia was established by the Rudd government under the now expired four-year National Partnership Agreement on Hospital and Health Workforce Reform, agreed by the Council of Australian Governments in November 2008. HWA became operational on 1 January 2010. Under the national partnership agreement HWA was to act as a national body working to health ministers to streamline clinical training arrangements and support workforce reform initiatives. All jurisdictions were to provide funding to HWA. However, the states and territories have not contributed any funding as agreed. That was to be $540 million over four years. The Commonwealth government has been the sole funder of HWA, committing $1.05 billion since its establishment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the passage of this bill, programs and functions of HWA will be transferred to the Department of Health. I say again that the government is not withdrawing support for the health workforce; it is delivering on its commitment to reduce red tape and streamline programs. Savings will support front-line health services and programs. Indeed, the budget does not cut funding for health at all. Annual federal assistance to the states for public hospitals will increase by more than nine per cent every year for the next three years and by more than six per cent in the fourth year. That is a 40 per cent increase over the next four years. We are increasing funding for states to run public hospitals by more than $5 million from $13.8 billion in 2013-14 to $18.9 billion in 2017-18. The overall annual health spending will increase by more than $10 billion or 16 per cent from $64.5 billion in 2013-14 to $74.8 billion in 2017-18. The government is also putting the growth in health spending on a more sustainable trajectory from 2017-18, but every year it will continue to grow. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me also say a few words about GP co-payments. From 1 July 2015 previously bulk-billed patients will contribute $7 towards the cost of standard GP consultations. Ten years ago, we were spending $8 billion a year on Medicare; today we are spending $20 billion. So we are asking everyone to make a modest contribution to ensure that Medicare is sustainable in the long term. A strong safety net will be put in place. Concession cardholders and children under 16 will only pay the contribution for the first 10 visits each year. The government will not be wasting this money. Every dollar of savings in health expenditure in the budget will be reinvested back into the Medical Research Future Fund. There is a very important point to make here: the government is not introducing a co-payment as much as reintroducing it. Prime Minister Bob Hawke actually introduced it in the 1991 budget. He and his health minister, Brian Howe, fully supported it. Someone else who has supported it is the member for Fraser, who also happens to be the shadow Assistant Treasurer. He is supposedly the brains trust for the Labor Party economic team. When he was studying for his PhD, which he got—</span>

Obviously, how we are making health spending sustainable into the future is directly relevant to this bill, Mr Deputy Speaker. If I may continue to make my remarks, I was talking about co-payments as a central part of the health spending of the budget and I was noting that when he was studying for his PhD—that is, the shadow Assistant Treasurer—which he got in 2004, not that long ago, he argued in relation to a co-payment, and I quote him from a 14 April 2003 article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>: </span>

Can I tell the House that to get a PhD, it usually involves a minimum of four years research, where you grapple with the subject day after day, coming to grips with every argument, every nuance and every alternative argument. After four years, you come to a considered decision. It would appear that, in the space of four weeks, the shadow minister has dumped four years of careful consideration. Political expedience will do that to you. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has a strong record of making sensible investments in Australia<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s health and medical workforce. As the Minister for Health has said, the Howard government invested in nine medical schools, which has resulted in the increase in medical students graduating now. The number of domestic school graduates per year has more than doubled since 1996. The government has committed to doubling the Practice Incentives Program teaching payment from $100 to $200 for each hour teaching session provided to a medical student. It will better compensate general practices for the consultation time dedicated to teaching; it will encourage more general practices to provide much-needed teaching opportunities; and it will to strengthen the future workforce. The measure will benefit approximately 3,000 general practices, and it is expected that approximately 20,000 students per annum will be provided with teaching sessions. A rural loading of up to 50 per cent will also be applied to payments to practices in rural and remote locations. Indeed, I want to acknowledge that this rural loading is so important for electorates like mine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the government is also investing $40 million in up to 100 additional medical internships each year in non-traditional settings, including private hospitals regional areas. This will provide more certainty for students and, to alleviate pressure on public hospitals for training, priority will be given to positions and rotations outside of major metropolitan centres to bolster the medical workforce in rural and regional areas. As a member for a regional seat, I strongly endorse this measure; it will inject talented medical students into areas of great need. I commend the minister for such a practical measure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will also provide infrastructure grants to general practices on the basis of an equal commitment from the practice. This will leverage private investment and help ensure efficient and productive use of resources. The government has committed to provide up to 175 grants for rural and remote general practices to expand facilities to support teaching and training of medical students and registrars. The grants of up to $300,000 will be provided to successful applicants and require a matched contribution from the practice. The measure will benefit the GPs, registrars, medical students and the community in inner-regional, outer-regional, remote and very remote Australia, where the grants will be targeted. These practices face unique challenges in the provision of health care. Providing more opportunities for medical students to experience rural and remote practice will encourage students to pursue careers outside of metropolitan areas once they graduate and help address the maldistribution of the medical workforce in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While talking about infrastructure, I am happy to confirm that the coalition government will continue with its $160 million commitment to the Bega Valley community to build the new South East Regional Hospital in the town of Bega. This is a major project in collaboration with the New South Wales government; we hope it will be completed in 2016. The New South Wales government is contributing $10 million and will be responsible for the ongoing operation of the hospital. Only in February this year was it announced that the tenders for the main works were awarded the Brookfield Multiplex. Do not let people think that this is the Labor government project, just because they announced it before the 2013 election. It is taking form and substance under a coalition government. We are actually getting the work done. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the government will also significantly expand the number of GP training places. GP training places will increase by 300 from 1,200 to 1,500 new places in 2015. This significant increase in training places will create more vocational training opportunities for this workforce, freeing up more junior doctor training positions for new graduates coming through. I also note that the Australian General Practice Training program has a distribution target that requires 50 per cent of training to occur in rural and remote locations. This is another step in the right direction—more GP training places will mean better medical delivery, and for a regional electorates such as mine that 50 per cent requirement that training occur in rural and remote locations recognises our needs. In conclusion, this government is making sensible changes to reduce waste on duplication and bureaucracy so that sustainable investments can continue to be made to services and programs that benefit our health system and our future workforce. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:54</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Health Workforce Australia (Abolition) Bill 2014, which seeks to repeal the Health Workforce Australia Act 2009 and absorb Health Workforce Australia's functions and programs back into the Department of Health. As we have heard from a number of contributors to this debate, Health Workforce Australia was established by Labor to provide a national, long-term, coordinated approach to health workforce planning and reform to ensure that Australia's health workforce can meet Australia's health needs into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the points that the new Minister for Health likes to trot out is the glib line that these are all just bureaucracies and that they have no value at all. This measure is counter to the government's own claim that they are seeking to put health on a more sustainable footing. Leaving aside that this has now been revealed to be a mere fig leaf for breaking their own election promise of 'no cuts to health', they are cutting health and they are heading down a path of substantially changing the Medicare system we have in this country. I note also that not a dollar, as noted in the previous speaker's contribution, is in fact being reinvested in the health system, in medical services, in public hospitals or in doctors, where there is apparently such a crisis of sustainability, which blows the government's own arguments out of the water.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clinicians are saying that where huge efficiencies are to be had in health—and you can look at academic paper after academic paper—is in the areas where we try to achieve consistent clinical practice across the country, tackling issues that lead to adverse events in hospitals. We know from the data that, in terms of readmissions to hospitals because of clinical failures, they are occurring and they are occurring on a more regular basis than they should be, and we actually have to deal with issues of quality and safety. We have to tackle issues that lead to those adverse incidents in hospitals and readmissions. We need to look at other clinical settings—for example, infection control, improving the quality and safety of clinical practice. Who oversights all of that work? Who actually brings stakeholders together? Who teaches people about the important clinical guidelines and how you actually work? They are organisations like Health Workforce Australia, like the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. They are the organisations that are actually driving efficiency and productivity in health. The government, in this bill in particular, is in fact going counter to its own false arguments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2006, the Productivity Commission was asked to look at the whole issue around the health workforce, and it concluded that a more sustainable and responsive health workforce was needed. The report went further by highlighting the complexity of Australia's health workforce arrangements and the numerous organisations and agencies involved in health workforce education and training. In other words, what we had at the time was lots of smaller agencies, inconsistencies between the states and territories, lots of different committees and a bit of a hodgepodge when it came to health workforce planning. It was getting better in terms of GPs—not so great in specialists but in terms of nursing and allied health it was literally a mess. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to that Productivity Commission report, in 2008 Labor took a proposal to COAG, which then agreed to the formation of a national health workforce agency to work across jurisdictions to build more effective, streamlined and integrated clinical training arrangements and to support workforce reform initiatives. The legislation establishing Health Workforce Australia was introduced in 2009 and in 2010 Health Workforce Australia commenced their work, partnering with higher education providers, the training sector, the health sector, employers, professions and regulatory bodies to deliver a sustainable health workforce for Australia. The key responsibilities outlined for Health Workforce Australia were national funding, planning and coordination of clinical training across all health disciplines and across jurisdictions, supporting health workforce research and planning, funding simulation training, and progressing new workforce models and reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health Workforce Australia in that short time has established itself and developed a track record in national health workforce planning. It has broad support from across the health workforce peak bodies in this country, and it has broad support from states and territories in its role. In 2012, Health Workforce Australia produced the first national long-term projections for doctors, nurses and midwives, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Health workforce 2025</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—</span><span style="font-style:italic;">doctors, nurses and midwives</span>. It set out the workforce needs of Australia in critical workforce groups over the future. The report highlighted that, under the arrangements and policy settings at that time, Australia would face a significant shortage of nurses and doctors by 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor deliberately set this agency up as separate from the department. Any of the people who have worked either in the department, as I have, or in agencies outside know the extraordinary tension that exists between policy development and the implementation that occurs. What we have seen constantly in this particular space is a really important debate, one I want to highlight here. The department has been very keen for a long time to get Health Workforce Australia and the funding associated with it back in the department. It has been very keen. I know that the department is not that keen—I am not going to refer to personalities within the department—to have too many separate agencies outside. With a new government coming in, I am very concerned that basically this has just been one of the agencies that has been put up to be brought back into the empire without any real thought being given by the government to what that actually means. I just caution the government about always taking on absolute face value every single piece of advice it might get. It needs to come up with its own ideas, and this one, I think, is concerning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since being established, Health Workforce Australia has funded close to 8½ thousand new quality clinical training places for students across 22 disciplines. Through the Simulated Learning Environments Program, Health Workforce Australia has increased simulated education hours by 115 per cent. I visited the John Hunter Hospital recently, where they were having an emergency theatre operation performed. They had their specialists, their nursing staff and their anaesthetists there going through the important practices that they needed to do. They talked about just how critical it had been to get the extra funding from Health Workforce Australia and the huge change they had had in the way they were doing clinical training within their hospital and bringing clinicians from other hospitals into that facility to make sure that they improved clinical training.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In direct response to the House of Representatives report <span style="font-style:italic;">Lost in the labyrinth</span>, the agency, in conjunction with the Australian Medical Council, has jointly funded the construction of Australia's first National Test Centre, which will serve to expedite testing of international medical graduates seeking to practise in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this planning and program activity is critical if Australia is to have the health workforce able to meet the health needs throughout Australia into the future, and it is critical if communities all over Australia are to be well served with good access to healthcare providers. As I have said many times in this place before, Australia's population is ageing, and we have increasing rates of chronic disease. If Australia is not planning and positioning itself in relation to the workforce needed to care for our future population, then we are going to be in strife.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is determined to undermine and rip apart universal health care for all Australians and revert to the old way, its way, of a haphazard and unplanned approach to workforce planning. Labor knows that that did not work, which is why Health Workforce Australia was established as a separate entity from the department and why funding was appropriated to support the unified, national approach to the health workforce for all Australia. A key issue arising out of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Health workforce 2025</span> report was the importance of and need to improve the national coordination of medical training by working with trainees, employers, educators and governments through a National Medical Training Advisory Network. If the government is to do away with the agency established to lead and drive this work in a coordinated way, it is not clear who or what entity it expects to carry on with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have already outlined that Health Workforce Australia's programs were addressing the issue of the distribution of the health workforce, in addition to increasing workforce numbers. The government can run their line on delivering front-line services—and I heard that from the other side here—as much as they want to, but, unless you invest in, plan, coordinate and train the health workforce of the future, there will be no-one to deliver those front-line services, no-one to deliver them in rural and regional communities, no-one to deliver them in Indigenous communities and no-one to deliver them in the outer metro areas, where there is extraordinary pressure on those services. So you can just see that there is an absolute myth in the way they are constructing these arguments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another really well-progressed initiative of Health Workforce Australia was the Expanded Scopes of Practice Program. I note particularly their extended-care paramedics project as well, ensuring that extended-care paramedics are able to assess patients in their own homes, reducing the number of presentations to emergency departments and reducing the number of patient transfers—an area of health efficiency, I would have thought. These advance paramedics are being trialled in South Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that even the government's own Commission of Audit has acknowledged the Expanded Scopes of Practice Program and suggested that this type of reform go further. Who do you think is going to do that work? Health Workforce Australia is at arm's length from government, at arm's length from the department, in an incredibly contested space. Who do you think is now going to lead and develop that work? The abolition of Health Workforce Australia is anticipated to 'save' the government $142 million. The minister would have us believe that no support is being taken away from the health workforce, but how can you take $142 million out of clinical training, placements and planning and still be maintaining support for the health workforce?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor came to office we inherited the now Prime Minister's caps on GP training places. We in fact doubled the number of places to 1,200 and increased this number each year so that Australia has top-quality, well-trained GPs moving through the ranks to provide Australians with the primary care they need. Under Labor the number of nurses in training grew by 11,000 and the number of specialists in training by 5,000. And we invested through Medicare Locals, providing funding to plan and fund extra health services that were supporting around 3,000 front-line health workers like GPs, nurses and psychologists. The investments that Labor made to supporting and growing Australia's high-quality health workforce were having an impact on all regions and enabling services to be delivered by a well-trained health workforce. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As at February 2013, Australia's health workforce totalled 1.3 million, made up of 25,000 GPs; 24,000 specialists; 290,000 nurses; 14,000 midwives; 12,700 dentists and 4,000 more people employed as dental therapists, hygienists and prosthetists; 1,254 Aboriginal health workers; and almost 94,000 registered allied health professionals—all doing critical work in this country. Abolishing Health Workforce Australia is not the way to continue to support planning in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will not and cannot support this bill because it is counter to the government's own arguments about how you get efficiencies in health. If you want to improve clinical training and education and get efficiencies in health, if you actually want that to occur, then you have to have an agency that is driving it. These are not bureaucracies. These are important organisations that are seeing important work done in the area of health efficiency. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAMING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  As we inherited a health system that ran out of money, as we pore over the performance of a Labor government that never saw a cause they could not fund, we come here today to look at Health Workforce Australia. I think it is only appropriate that we recognise that the many good employees in that agency did great work over four years and that some very important reports were prepared, written and disseminated. But the work of Health Workforce Australia in doing that good work is now done. We now have to reinvest in the front line of health and that has been a clear message from the coalition government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world, with one of the highest performing health systems. Keeping up that quality care in every corner of this nation, wherever citizens choose to live, is a daunting task. I say to the 35,000 GPs out there, the 290,000 nurses and the 100,000 allied health workers all over this great nation: thank you for what you do every day, and the interference from government—certainly if I have anything to do with it—will be as minimal as possible. Thank you for caring for Australians from dawn to dusk; for the after-hours work you do; for your coordination of complex care in tiny towns. To all of you: thank you. Be you from Cape York to Kalumburu, from Byron Bay to Busselton, we have an incredible health workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With that workforce come some pretty big challenges in health distribution, capacity and training, but it is not one where we need to count our successes by the number of floors in the high-rise building where we have bureaucrats offering support. This is not to be measured by how many pot plants are watered, how many water bubblers we have and how many people we can employ in major cities worrying about country areas. No, this is about supporting the front line, and that is what this government is determined to do. When you have a health system in a nation like Australia endeavouring to deliver world-class care in remote, rural and regional areas as well as in our cities where there is high need, the one thing we must be sure of is that we never take a dollar away from that old man who needs a new hip, that we never take a dollar away from that woman who needs cancer treatment, all in the guise of needing better organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can appreciate that no matter what country you go to, no matter great their health system is, if you talk to people they will find problems. The natural Labor inclination for every challenge is to set up another agency. That government set up so many agencies they ran out of acronyms—they could not come up with any more acronyms. We have over 20 health agencies now, all with their own individual backends, their own administrative systems, their own support systems, and all operating in a space where it gets so complex they need yet another agency to tell agencies how to talk to each other. There are a dozen health agencies collecting health data using different criteria so that we cannot even perform basic comparisons with that information that is so expensively collected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to Australian practitioners out there in the health system that we as a government want you to go and serve the people and we know a third of Australians do not live in capital cities. You have seen governments from both sides of the fence—let me give some credit—working on that really important proposition. But when the Abbott government came to power we said we just did not need more floors in a high-rise building in a capital city to fix a problem. We know that if we are going to fix a workforce problem we do so with a workforce solution—and you start with your students. You make it more possible for them to get scholarships. You make it more attractive for them to be supervised by our great clinicians. You create more general practice training places. You free up some funding for infrastructure, not in a GP Superclinic handout. That is not how we do it on this side. We provide matching funds so that regional practices will invest their own money and truly utilise that investment efficiently in infrastructure to help GPs train others and train their successors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have lived in a country town that had a retiring general practitioner. The fear in that town at the thought of losing a general practitioner was palpable on the street, outside the Foodland, outside Australia Post. Attracting practitioners out there is a complex balance of supporting Medicare and supporting access, supporting those good country people who take out private health cover and often do not use it greatly because there is not even a private hospital in town. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have got to support access to the PBS by looking after that pharmacist and making sure that he or she can afford to run that business. Then we have to make sure that support for ancillary and allied health care is such that allied health workers will leave the cities where they train and set up their shingle in those small towns. That is the essence of a workforce solution and that is the coalition's approach to doing just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not want to take the remaining five minutes to pull apart the achievements of Health Workforce Australia. I have already said that some of their reports were valuable and welcomed. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Health </span><span style="font-style:italic;">workforce </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2025</span> report gave us some pretty sobering statistics, about being over 100,000 nurses short within 15 years and, depending on productivity and 'business as usual' modelling, we could well be short by up to 1,500 to 1,800 general practitioners. In the end, those figures told us what we already knew. They told us we had workforce challenges ahead. The 'do nothing' scenario, business as usual, was never going to happen, because sensible governments were going to make changes between now and then to ensure Australians had the support and the services that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us make no mistake: we are getting close to the appropriate numbers of many of our health professions. There is still room for more nursing training. We have a maldistribution issue, an issue of redirecting the health effort to areas where it is most needed. That was to be the focus of Health Workforce Australia but, like most entities established by the previous Labor government, they were hopelessly and overly broadly commissioned. They were expected to do everything and, in the end, they did a few things well. However, we are replete with examples of poorly-spent money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the <span style="font-style:italic;">Growing our future</span> report and the emphasis upon respecting, encouraging and cultivating our Aboriginal health worker population is really important. We need those Aboriginal health workers. But I am not sure that we needed to develop the community's understanding by funding a television documentary to do so. I have got no problem with really great but modest causes being done pro bono. I have no problem with engaging the university sector—PhDs and those who are aspiring to earn one—getting involved in solving some of our great problems. But I do not think that, as long as our health system will always need more money on the front line, we should be doing things like funding large and complex online hubs in the hope that they will be used by practitioners. There are way more modest ways to get to the same solution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I heard about the National Inventory of Innovation I thought to myself, 'How many hardworking GPs actually have time to look at online innovation hubs?' In reality, if you are going to refocus and refashion general practice in regional Australia, start by talking to the local GP. Do not start by setting up an empire in Adelaide and then wondering what you can create from the fifth floor that will reinvent health workforce in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health Workforce Australia embarked on a very important piece of work, looking at cancer workforce in Australia. We have significantly refashioned cancer service delivery in this country, but we are still vexed with major publicly funded cancer services in large cities and smaller cancer services in regional cities and the way in which these interact. Health Workforce Australia were right to turn their attention to that topic. But, in the end, have they significantly changed the business model of cancer in this country? The answer is no—a fascinating expose of the challenges of getting cancer workforce out into our regional cities and towns but, in the end, very little change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Health Workforce Innovation and Reform Strategic Framework was published in the middle of last year. It was a comprehensive course of action for a range of reforms that would have been appropriate to help regional workforce. But I put to you: that is the job of the department. The previous speaker, who claims to be a bureaucrat in a past life, acknowledged the tension between policy creation and service delivery. But that is not an excuse sufficient to create new agencies; it is an excuse to fix the problem in the department. The department is big enough, well-resourced enough, to attack some of these major workforce challenges without the need for these extra agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that Health Workforce Australia worked on a prescribing pathway for those who are not general practitioners, nondoctors. Controversial as that is, that was never going to address a workforce problem in this country. But resources were devoted there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Workforce agencies, states and territories would have been grateful that there was yet another kid on the block working on getting people out into the bush. Aspen Medical were relocating thousands of health workers to Central Australia, only to have yet another provider, Health Workforce Australia, lay claim over four years of effort in relocating 400 workers. That is a drop in the ocean and that is not what we expected to have another provider doing when, in fact, we have these rural health workforce agencies already fully commissioned and fully funded in every state in this country. Recruitment is a challenge and it is complex. But that is not an excuse for another agency. Fixing up the recruitment process, simplifying the immigration process for incoming health practitioners from overseas who apply to be registered here, is not an excuse to get more, independent double-dipping and silo-structured agencies operating out of, in this case, Adelaide, trying to fix a problem that really should have been sorted out, without the need for the agency in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health Workforce Australia put together a Reconciliation Action Plan, released, I think, in April 2013. One of how many? I do not know. I ask: how many reconciliation action plans were read by health practitioners? How many of them were downloaded? With the greatest of respect, I am very keen to see as many reconciliation action plans put together as possible, but I do not see the need for massive transfers of government resources to develop them. Plans focusing on fostering these relationships are utterly welcome, but not large transfers of taxpayers' money to achieve them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had 500 health leaders come together for a conference, the first national conference in, I think, 2012, Reshaping Australia's Health Workforce. There is no problem if it is cost recovery 100 per cent. I have no problem with a health leaders' group. There is no problem with a group of 500 young health leaders getting together online, at no cost to the taxpayer, because that is how it should work. There is no problem with cultivating those great policymakers, but there is no need for taxpayers' money to be diverted or consumed in the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we had the launch of the HWA Connect, an online interactive consultation hub. Just in case you are confused, it is different from the online resource. That was developed because there were so many of these outputs coming from Health Workforce Australia that you needed one place where you could find them all. So the next thing we knew was that we had the Integrated Regional Clinical Training Networks; the nursing workforce retention and productivity group; the National Medical Training Advisory Network; the mental health peer workforce; the Rural Medical Generalist Framework; the International Medical Graduates' Orientation and Supervision project; and Health LEADS Australia all on this resource, again, created from taxpayers' money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can only go so far, Deputy Speaker. You have to appreciate that. In the end there is only so much money that you can convince yourself is well spent from a fifth floor in Adelaide. Ultimately we have to go and confront the coalface that is working in small and regional communities and high-need urban communities where there is significant urban poor. That is where we need to make sure workforce is available, to make a real difference to Australians' health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I have emphasised that we have a changing environment, an ageing workforce as well as an ageing population, a new raft of diseases, social and economic determinants of health that are changing and ever more complex and the imposition of highly expensive technology, and health is one of the few areas where you cannot really replace labour with capital. No matter how much capital you invest in this system, you need labour to run it. It is one of the most complex areas of public policy and one of the most complex areas of public service. There are probably more groups and more politically active groups engaged in delivering services here than in any other part of the economy. So I thank the people that do that work. I commend those that try and improve the system and lift their head away from caring for patients to dream of a better system, but most of them, no matter how much you look at, will argue that more investment in something like Health Workforce Australia was really only adding undue complexity and bringing a risk of waste of taxpayers' money to the table.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am glad to see the back of Health Workforce Australia. I acknowledge that in their time they did good work. I think in retrospect history will record that they pulled together some useful reports. With those completed, it is now time to move on and reinvest in the frontline by building capacity, by investing in more students, by freeing up general practice places, and by having rural infrastructure funding that can be partnered with GP investment we can do just that. We can transform the situation in regional general practice and we can make sure that those in outer met and inner urban poor get all of the care that they need, complex arrangements provided by teams of health practitioners. But in the end the one thing that Australians will welcome will be the passing of an entity that for four years produced useful reports but was at risk of having an overly broad commission and letting down those who need health care most.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  In my 2014 budget reply speech I said I was going to devote more time to health policy issues and become more expert in these matters. In delivering on that, yesterday I had the opportunity to speak at some length about preventive health and today I want to make some observations about our health workforce. The Health Workforce Australia Abolition Bill seeks to repeal the Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009 and absorb Health Workforce Australia's functions and programs into the Department of Health. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2006 the Productivity Commission report <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">health workforce</span> concluded that a more sustainable and responsive health workforce was needed. The report also highlighted the complexity of Australia's health workforce arrangements and the involvement of numerous bodies at all levels in health workforce education and training. In 2008 COAG agreed to the creation of a national health workforce agency that works across jurisdictions to establish more effective, streamlined and integrated clinical training arrangements and to support workforce reform initiatives. The Health Workforce Australia Bill back in 2009 established a national health workforce agency, Health Workforce Australia. Since its establishment Health Workforce Australia produced Australia's first ever national long-term projections for doctors, nurses and midwives with the publication in 2012 of <span style="font-style:italic;">Health </span><span style="font-style:italic;">workforce 2025: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">doctors, nurses and midwives</span>. This report highlighted that under current policy settings Australia will face a significant shortage of nurses and a shortage of doctors by 2025. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has become highly dependent on migration of international health professionals, particularly in rural and remote communities, as a consequence of a lack of sufficient attention to training young Australians to take up health workforce roles. In the 2013-14 budget the previous Labor government invested more than $344 million in Health Workforce Australia to support Australia's healthcare system and its workforce, especially in rural and remote areas. Health Workforce Australia has delivered an additional 446 nurses and allied health professionals to rural and remote communities. It is very surprising to me and quite unacceptable that Australia is one of the least self-sufficient nations amongst comparable OECD countries in terms of meeting our health workforce needs through domestic training efforts. It is even more remarkable that, despite this, what we are seeing today is skilled nurses finding it difficult to find work. The proportion of international nurses we bring into Australia each year on 457 visas is comparable to the proportion of nurse graduates who find themselves unable to find work. Seriously, how are Australian nurses meant to transition from graduate into experienced nurses if the opportunities to work, experience and refine their skills are not available to them? It is wrong and foolish and short-sighted that Australian nurses are not given employment priority. Instead, hospitals and managers are getting bonuses for bringing in foreign nurses and getting them to sign up with universities to do masters and PhDs in nursing at great expense to the migrants themselves and at great cost to the wider Australian society. While this is going on, many excellent local nurses with years of experience are now unable to find work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a submission to the 457 Visa Integrity Review the Australian Nurses and Midwifery Federation pointed out 'the sorry state of the employment prospects for new nurse graduates, with an increasing number struggling to find work, with many rejected for work by employers that use international recruited nurses under the 457 program'. They urged the panel to resist calls for any deregulation that will remove or dilute current protections or safeguards, particularly to labour market testing, English language requirements and current obligations regarding wages and employment conditions. I believe the nurses federation is quite right to urge the government not to water down the 457 visa program. The underemployment of nursing graduates, despite the employment of large numbers of offshore nurses, is inconsistent with the key policy objective of the temporary migrant worker programs. There is a clear policy disconnect here that needs to be addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nurses federation estimates that, in 2013, 60 per cent of Tasmanian nursing graduates were unable to find work; in Queensland only around 28 per cent of new nursing graduates secured positions with Queensland Health; in 2014, only 600 of 2½ thousand graduates were employed; and, in 2013, 800 graduates in Victoria, 400 in Western Australia and 280 in South Australia could not secure positions. An online questionnaire of new graduates undertaken by the nurses federation revealed further troubling anecdotal evidence of large numbers of new graduates failing to find employment in their field; many graduates receiving numerous employment rejections—and in one case over 70; most graduates fortunate enough to obtain employment being engaged on a precarious basis through agency, part-time or casual arrangements; many graduates going to great lengths to obtain work—for example, by moving interstate and separating themselves from their families; most employers who were named in the questionnaire as rejecting new graduates using 457 labour; and, finally, and I think most seriously, most new graduates are saddled with a HECS debt and many are disillusioned that they studied at all. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, if this government gets its way in deregulating student fees and increasing the interest on student debts, young student nurses will be at risk of being in the demoralising position of having no jobs and going deeper and deeper into debt. I agree 100 per cent with the nurses federation that the current labour market testing requirements need to be strengthened to include employer obligations such as the need to advertise locally and nationally at market rates; offering relocation, housing and utility assistance where required; reporting on specific measures taken to employ disadvantaged groups, local job seekers and recently retrenched workers; and, where possible, making sure that new graduates have a reasonable chance of filling vacancies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Graduate nurses are our future. Initiatives need to be in place to ensure that they are placed in employment upon completion of their degrees, otherwise the future of Australian nursing will be one of shortages of nurses and dependence on overseas recruiting. Given the proposed changes to the federal budget, it is a bleak outlook for thousands of nursing graduates each year who are desperate to be employed but are often losing out on job opportunities to nurses recruited by hospitals and other facilities on 457 visas. The nurses federation is right when saying in their submission that, putting aside the demoralising and devastating effect that this has on new graduates who are unable to find work after undertaking a three-year tertiary course, it also represents a loss in investment in the education of professional health workers and a loss in the contribution of these potential workers to the healthcare systems—absolutely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the light of these facts, one has to seriously question how well temporary migrant worker programs like the 457 visa program are serving this country. I think it would be crazy to further liberalise the program. The only reason for doing this would be to undermine the pay and conditions of local workers. Yet, this is what the government with its 457 visa review seems to want to do. The situation is so grim that there is an online petition circulating calling for a review of the issuing of subclass 457 visas for nurses in Australia which has over 27,000 signatures. Anyone interested can find the petition on the website candobetter.net. Online comments by supporters of this petition include: 'We must give priority to Australian nurses over 457 visa holders; our future depends on it' and 'Destroying the reasonable expectations of employment of nurses born here is cruel, unnecessary and shameful'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 457 visa program, in my view, needs tightening to ensure that Australian workers and young people are given priority over temporary visa workers. Immigration department figures released in May show that there were over 110,000 457 visa workers in Australia on 31 March this year, up by over 6,000 or 5.9 per cent compared to 12 months ago. The 457 visa workforce is growing much faster than Australian employment generally. This is completely unjustifiable in the present jobs climate. It is a recipe for increasing unemployment with all the misery and hardship that accompanies that. It is all very well for ministers opposite to say that everyone has to earn or learn, but how are you supposed to earn even after you have learned when we have over a million people in Australia on temporary visas, which give them no work rights—a docile workforce who employers prefer because they can be sent packing from the country if they speak out about their rights at work?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal government is allowing too many employers to access 457 visas without any obligation to look for Australian workers first and young people especially are losing out. Under the coalition, around two-thirds of all 457 visas are not subject to any employer obligation to advertise the job and test the local labour market, and nearly half of all 457 visas are still going to younger foreign workers aged 30 or less. Prime Minister Abbott promised 'no cuts to health' but the abolition of Health Workforce Australia through this bill is another example of that promise being broken. Labor established Health Workforce Australia to provide a national, long-term, coordinated approach to health workforce planning and reform to ensure our health workforce can meet the increasing demand for health services now and into the future. Health Workforce Australia has had a proven track record in national health workforce planning, which is crucial if Australia is to have a health workforce able to meet the health needs of Australians wherever they live into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health Workforce Australia has funded 8,400 new quality clinical training places for students across 22 individual disciplines. It has supported a 115 per cent increase in simulated education hours in 2012 through the Simulated Learning Environments Program. The Health Workforce Australia report <span style="font-style:italic;">Health </span><span style="font-style:italic;">workforce </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2025</span> shows the current medical training system is inefficient and there is an uneven distribution of the medical workforce, which of course particularly affects rural and remote communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key policy action from Health Workforce Australia's report was to improve the national coordination of medical training by working with trainees, employers, educators and governments through the National Medical Training Advisory Network. A <span style="font-style:italic;">Medical Observer </span>article following the budget quoted medical experts who condemned the proposal to merge Health Workforce Australia into the health department. It said that, in the view of the President of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Liz Marles:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the move would risk destabilising general practice training …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and in the same article the CEO of the Public Health Association Australia, Michael Moore, was said to have labelled the plan short-sighted. Mr Moore argues that the merged organisations would have neither the same independence nor influence if they were combined with the health department. Professor Simon Willcock, who sat on the board, also pointed to the good work Health Workforce Australia have done in developing databases and around workforce projections, and he lamented:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It would be a shame to see all of that work not continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, if this bill is passed, this complex but important planning work will not occur on a national level, and the burden will fall to the states and territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I regret that this government seems determined to dismantle universal health care and consign our country to a return to a piecemeal approach to health-workforce planning. I am concerned that this will result in a boom-and-bust cycle in the supply of doctors, nurses and midwives. This scenario is unsustainable and unaffordable, and it will result in a health workforce which will not be able to meet the increasing demands for health care, now and into the future.</span>

He quoted at length—for about 11 minutes—in his speech stories from the nurses' federation about the role of nurses and where we were going and all that sort of stuff: what did Health Workforce Australia do about it? Isn't that what they were supposed to be doing? The member went through this whole account of what Health Workforce Australia is; he spent nearly three minutes on Health Workforce Australia in his speech. But isn't that what they were supposed to be doing? Wouldn't that be a core responsibility for Health Workforce Australia? Isn't that what we should be talking about here? Isn't that the role of the department?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a couple of real points here. There was a four-year agreement that all Australian governments were to provide funding for Health Workforce Australia. It has expired. However, the states and territories have not contributed any of the agreed funding. So, once again, you have a Labor federal government making decisions for other levels of government which are never going to be supported. Right from the get-go, this thing has fallen over—it has fallen at the very first hurdle. The Commonwealth government has been the sole funder of Health Workforce Australia, committing $1.05 billion since its establishment. Where is the money from the states? This is all supposed to be under the National Partnership Agreement on Hospital and Health Workforce Reform. This was supposed to be an agreement between the states and the federal government. When they said, 'Are we all going to put in?' it was, 'Yeah!' So they all signed up. But no money was ever put in from the states. So where does the actual agreement come from?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are doing with the Health Workforce Australia (Abolition) Bill 2014 is streamlining the delivery of health workforce policy and programs through removing unnecessary levels of administration and bureaucracy. We could not have been clearer about what we were trying to do when we talked about our overall strategy on health. The Minister for Health, who is sitting at the table, was very clear in all my conversations with him and in all he said in the press. Our philosophy was about getting the goods to the customer and about removing the number of hands through which the goods had to pass before they got there, because at every stage along the way you lose some money—the more levels of bureaucracy you put between the source and the recipient, the less money gets to the recipient. It is just like farm produce: the product goes from the farm gate, through a wholesaler to a retailer, and the more hands the product goes through, in going from the farm to the end-user, the more expensive that product will be. So it makes perfect sense to me that, if we can cut down the levels of bureaucracy and the numbers of people who are standing in the way of getting our health dollars to our people—to the people in the community, the people we are supposed to be helping—then the better off we will be.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has committed to doubling the Practice Incentives Program, or PIP, Teaching Payment from $100 to $200 for each three-hour training session provided to a medical student. Can I just tell you a story to show what we are trying to do in this country and what is actually happening out there? It feeds into what we are trying to do here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a good friend in Townsville and he had a doctor from the Congo who was doing training with him. A 64-year-old man came in to see them and he presented with pneumonia. The doctor from the Congo, who was being supervised by my friend the Australian doctor, gave this man some Panadol and was going to send him home. My friend stopped him at the door and said to the doctor, 'Why did you do that?' And the doctor said, 'Well, he's 64 years old and he's got pneumonia; he's going to die. I'm sending him home.' My friend said, 'Not in Australia, mate; not in Australia.' So what we have to do is to make sure that we get our doctors and GPs to be able to understand exactly what is required to be a GP here. We need to be able to pick up on those things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think most of us here who have a good relationship with our GP will understand just what role they play in our lives. I know that when I go to my GP she can tell from the first time she looks at me how much trouble she will find I am in when I get into the room. This is what a good GP will do for you. So if we can do anything to assist GP practices, and if we can do anything to assist people who provide primary health care, that is what we should do. We do not assist primary health care by establishing another building in another city or another capital city around Australia to rake out these sorts of things.</span>

And Hacker says, 'But there are no patients!' The reply is, 'The patients would ruin it!' The patients ruin the health system. It is like 'education is wasted on the young', but they are the necessary part of it. That is why we are there! And that is why the work of Health Workforce Australia has been completed and it should be rolled up.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government just had a problem with letting go. As the member for Bowen has reminded us, they did do some very good work but when you start to self-perpetuate to try to find out what you are trying to do and what you stand for, and if you give people such a wide brief that they no longer actually produce anything of significance, you have to wonder why they are still being funded. I believe that the Labor Party would say, 'We are going to employ someone to build your house. But when the house is built we still want to keep that bloke on, because we don't want him to lose his job. So we should just keep on funding him all the way through. It is that sort of thing that we just have to do.' Sooner or later the job is done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is also investing $40 million in up to 100 additional medical internships each year in non-traditional settings including private hospitals in regional areas. Townsville is the perfect example of this. We have a number of full-fee-paying doctors who have come through their training at universities throughout Australia who otherwise would have been cast to the wood heap if it were not for the health minister of Australia at the time, Peter Dutton—sitting at the table here today—saying that we cannot let this happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we had all these interns taken into the Mater Hospital Pimlico in Townsville and put to work there. They are predominantly overseas students but educated in Australia. I will 'sort of' quote the Minister for Health when he said, 'Look, we understand that your parents and your country have supported you to be here and we can't really come out and say that we want you to stay in Australia. But, gees, it would be handy if you all met a partner here, settle down in Townsville and became members of our society—never went home, got citizenship and stayed here for ever.' Those are the sorts of things that we must do. But this internship is about making sure that we get value for these people in completing their degrees, and making sure that they come out as good a doctor as we can possibly handle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has also committed to provide up to 175 grants for rural and remote general practices to expand facilities to support teaching and training of medical students and registrars. The grants of up to $300,000 will be provided to successful applicants and require a matched contribution from the practice. In Townsville we have a GP Super Clinic which was promised in 2007, promised in 2010 and was actually built—it has the signs up, has the car park marked out, has the beautiful frosted glass and everything—but still not opened, seven years after being promised. Not one thing—$6 million down the gurgler with nothing happening. And they built that thing less than 800 metres away from an existing GP practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The GP around the corner had to pay for his own facility. The physio across the road from the GP had to pay for his own facility. He carries that loan, but the GP Super Clinic that the federal government brought in, ostensibly to take the pressure off the emergency department—but this one will only be open from seven in the morning until nine at night—was never going to bulk-bill anyone, even when bulk-billing was the course de rigueur. That is not going to take the pressure off the emergency department. So this thing was an abject failure from day one and should never have progressed beyond that. But the previous government could not let itself get away with that and just kept on pouring money in, in direct competition with someone around the corner who has a mortgage and loans in trying to make a business run. What we will do is to enhance the practice that is there dollar for dollar and to enhance the medical training facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will also, significantly, expand the number of GP training places. GP training places will increase by 300—from 1,200 to 1,500 new places in 2015. The significant increase in GP training places will create more vocational training opportunities for this workforce, freeing up more junior doctor training positions for new graduates coming through. The Australian General Practice Training program, which the government's commitment will expand, has a distribution target that requires 50 per cent of training to occur in rural and remote locations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">James Cook University in my city of Townsville had a medical school established under the prime ministership of John Howard. That was one of the greatest achievements of Peter Lindsay, the former member for my seat. And they are turning out doctors who work as registrars all around Northern and regional Australia. We are trying to work on programs where we can do the New Colombo Plan, where people can actually do some training and placements in places like Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and out to Fiji. We should be able to do those things. That is why making the decisions as close as possible to the student and to the client will actually happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I have left I would like to address a couple of things in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. Obviously, this is a concern for everyone in this House and everyone in this House takes a great deal of interest in relation to our first Australians. It is of great concern to me, being from a regional area, that we do see a lot of Indigenous people in hospital. If you walk through the Townsville Hospital, the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders is absolutely shocking. This overrepresentation is a cause for great concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Townsville is a regional centre so we do have people flying in for treatment, but the number of Aboriginal and Islander people in the hospital at any one time just beggars belief. There is something going seriously wrong out there, and it comes down to education; it comes down to example and education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have Palm Island in my electorate, where domestic violence is a massive issue. It is a massive issue all throughout the Pacific. In my electorate we have domestic violence and major health issues, but it comes down to access to the clinician and access to education and example.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have Matthew Bowen in North Queensland—probably the greatest full-back of all time. He is currently overseas for a couple of years with Wigan. I can tell you one story about Matthew Bowen. On his first trip away he scored a try for the Cowboys. They gave him a can of beer and they said, 'Congratulations!' He took a mouthful out of it and said, 'I don't know how you can drink this stuff!' and poured it out. He is a father of two kids and he has a partner, Rudie. He is a great family member and still loves going home to Hopevale. His mum is a teachers' aide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would love to see Matthew Bowen go around and talk to the kids about the choices he made to get there. More than that, I would love to see someone like his mum, who still works as a teacher's aide at the Hope Vale State School, sit down and talk to parents about the choices and decisions she made to make sure that Matthew Bowen was given the opportunity and given the diet that actually mattered for him to come through as the person he did. We can do those things that are so close to the ground, which will cost so little money, but which will yield actual tangible results for someone that we actually know. More than that, a parent should know that giving a child a can of Fanta at six o'clock in the morning may keep them quiet for a little while but is not good for them. We must address this issue because they are dying too quickly and too soon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People like Michael Gleadow of Connect'n'Grow, who had nothing to do with Workforce Australia, has come up with a program of taking healthcare workers into schools such as Abergowrie College and Shalom Christian College. They have dedicated facilities there to make sure that he is able to get these people to go through training so they know how to take blood pressure, know what the vital signs are, and can do basic health care there. He has a stitch-up with Deakin University so they can become nurse clinicians and health workers. It has become a career path for a lot of people who care about the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we can get those sorts of decisions made at that level by someone who has just come up with an idea and goes and gets some equipment from Catholic Education to go into these places, we get the good result. I thank Health Workforce Australia for what they have done but their time is over. It is time for people on the ground to do what we need to do.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="83N" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  It was interesting to hear the member for Herbert raise issues of alcohol abuse, obesity and domestic violence associated with alcohol abuse. I just remind him that he voted to abolish the Preventative Health Agency last night in this parliament. It was an agency that actually provided education and did exactly what he was calling for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Health Workforce Australia (Abolition) Bill 2014 is a very short-sighted piece of legislation. It is legislation that will have an enormous impact on health workforce planning in Australia. The member for Herbert was another member of this parliament at the time health work planning was ad hoc and led to a maldistribution of the health workforce across all health disciplines in Australia. Health Workforce Australia has addressed this maldistribution. It has planned and looked to the future of the health workforce needs of this country and the health needs of our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health Workforce Australia ensures that the Australian government and the state governments work together to provide the health workforce and the services that Australians need. It is a fantastic advance and it is very short-sighted for this government to seek to abolish it. Planning is an ongoing process as needs change. There is not a start and a finish date. That is particularly apparent in health. You need to have health prevention, you have got to have strategies in place and you need to look at best practice for treatments. Every Australian needs to be able to access health care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health Workforce Australia is an independent body that works across jurisdictions. It has responsibility for the national coordination of planning and training of Australia's health workforce. It undertakes complex planning that would otherwise fall to a state or territory. Abolishing Health Workforce Australia is a very reactive approach to health workforce planning—the kind that we saw in the past. The removal of Health Workforce Australia will lead to a return to the boom-and-bust approach to the supply of doctors, nurses and midwives because the system responds in a very ad hoc fashion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health Workforce Australia has provided a planned expansion of its clinical training program. It funds clinical placements of health students across Australia and allows them to complete the full clinical requirements of their training. One of my bibles on health and health workforce is <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">blame game</span>, a report on the inquiry into health funding that was brought down in 2006. The terms of reference were given to the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing by the Prime Minister, the then health minister. That report made some interesting findings in health workforce shortages before Health Workforce Australia came into existence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health Workforce Australia came into existence to address the maldistribution of the health workforce across Australia, a situation where some Australians could receive health care and others could not. I have referred to this quote made by Terry Clout, the then CEO of the Hunter New England Health Service, a number of times in this place. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If you are in metropolitan Sydney, or if you are in New South Wales, the further you are from the Harbour Bridge, the greater the impact of the shortage of trained doctors, nurses and allied health staff …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was brought about by the previous policies that saw restrictions put on universities and other colleges and it impacted on the workforce. I would also like to refer to this excellent document that says, 'Health workforce shortages in Australia have developed over a long period of time'. That is what the committee found at that time. In response to a perceived oversupply, a cap was placed on the number of medical school students that could be trained. Once again it was a very ad hoc approach to the provision of GPs across Australia. It identified a number of other issues in relation to shortages, but the key message that the committee received was that it was an ad hoc process; it was a reactive process; there was no long-term planning, and every move, every decision, was made in a reactive way. That was why Health Workforce Australia came into being. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would now like to refer to another report of the health and ageing committee; this one was brought down in March 2012. It is called <span style="font-style:italic;">Lost in the labyrinth</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eport on the inquiry into registration processes and support for overseas trained doctors</span>. This once again excellent document highlights that in 2008 the COAG National Partnership Agreement on Hospital and Health Workforce Reform announced that it would establish Health Workforce Australia. It states that Health Workforce Australia was established: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To facilitate more effective and integrated clinical training for health professionals, provide effective and accurate information and advice to guide health workforce policy and planning, and promote, support and evaluate health workforce reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what health workforce planning is about. I am pleased that the minister is here in the chamber now so I can say to him: this is a really short-sighted decision. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health Workforce Australia plays a vital role in the planning of the health workforce across Australia. It ensures that we do not go back to the boom-and-bust approach that we had in previous times. It ensures that all Australians, no matter where they live, can access quality health care. Whether it is doctors, hospital nurses, community nurses, physios or other allied health professionals, you need to plan so that you can train the right number of health professionals. You need to plan to ensure that the people undertaking the training are distributed across Australia so that a situation does not exist in which the further you are from Sydney Harbour Bridge in New South Wales the poorer the service that you will receive. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health Workforce Australia manages and oversees the workforce. It has looked at increasing supply. It has improved the capacity and the productivity of the health sector. It has worked on clinical education, because in a health workforce you need to have ongoing education. It has looked at the immigration and training of overseas doctors. It is a program that looks at the system, the funding and the payment mechanism, to support new models of care and expanded roles. It has been redesigning and creating evidence based alternatives, looking at scopes of practice and developing strategies for aligning incentives around productivity and performance. That is what health workforce planning is about. That is what we need in this country. We need a situation where we have a trained workforce and a workforce that is evenly distributed across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of projects have been put in place under Health Workforce Australia. It has implemented actions to address health workforce shortages. It has worked very closely with the Australian Medical Council. It has worked on workforce innovation and reform programs. It has worked in five main domains: health workforce reform for more effective, efficient and accessible service delivery; health workforce capacity and skills development; leadership for the sustainability of the health system; health workforce planning; health workforce policy, funding and regulation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It really makes me sad to think about the problems that were exacerbated by poor planning and an ad hoc approach to our health system before Labor came to power in 2007. After all our struggle, after the big input, after the effort that so many people made to address the problems that existed, it really makes me sad that we are returning to those days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to reiterate that Health Workforce Australia provides a national, long-term, coordinated approach to workforce planning and reform, to ensure that our health workforce can meet the increasing demands for health services. It has a proven track record in national health workforce planning, and that is critical for all Australians. It has provided the first national, long-term projection for doctors, nurses and midwives, with the 2012 report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Health</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> workforce 2025: doctors, nurses and midwives</span>. I was astounded to see that this was actually the first publication of this kind and then to learn that the body that oversaw the production of this document is now going to be abolished. It shows how short-sighted those on the other side of this parliament are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health Workforce Australia has funded 8,400 new clinical training placements for students across 22 disciplines—once again ensuring that we have in place the health workforce that Australia needs for the future. It supported a 115 per cent increase in simulated education hours in 2012 through simulated learning environment programs. That is very, very important. It is imperative that our health workforce has ongoing training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this bill is passed it will lead to a situation where complex planning work will not occur at a national level, and that will place a burden on the states. It will lead to a fragmented system, a system that will not benefit Australians that rely on this parliament to ensure that we have the right type of health policy in place and the right bodies established to look at the planning and the future needs of health within Australia. This is truly bad legislation. I implore the Minister for Health to rethink this, and I encourage members on the other side of this House to cross the floor and vote with the opposition. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  I applaud the member for Shortland for making such a definitive and accurate statement at the end of her speech—that this is incredibly bad legislation. The background to the Health Workforce Australia (Abolition) Bill 2014 is quite interesting and in many ways it mirrors the history of a bill we discussed yesterday, which was the Energy Efficiency Opportunities (Repeal) Bill 2014. The Health Workforce Australia (Abolition) Bill 2014 and the Energy Efficiency Opportunities (Repeal) Bill 2014, which we discussed yesterday, both have their beginnings in the last years of the Howard government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">COAG commissioned a report from the Productivity Commission on Australia's health workforce back in 2005—again in the last years of the Howard government. It was quite forward-thinking: looking ahead to the ageing of the population; looking at the uncoordinated and complex arrangements across the states and the federal government; and looking at the lack of management of Australia's workforce, education and training as we move into the future. That report came down and a few years later, in 2008, the Council of Australian Governments, which had commissioned the Productivity Commission's research, agreed with the then federal government to provide a combined funding of over $3 billion to a national partnership agreement on hospital and health workforce reform—an incredibly important and quite difficult agreement to reach, but reached by all state governments and the federal government because they recognised and understood that there was a serious lack of forward planning and a lot of waste and inefficiency in the way that this nation managed the development of its health workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of that partnership agreement, Health Workforce Australia was formed in 2009. This organisation had a complex task in front of it, including the funding, planning and coordinating of clinical training across all health disciplines, the funding of simulation training, supporting health workforce research and planning and progressing new workforce models and reforms. All reports of the work done by Health Workforce Australia are positive. It has done remarkable work. It released in 2012 a report looking at the needs of the health workforce through to 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the comments of previous speakers that Health Workforce Australia has in fact been so successful that it has now done its job. They said the same thing yesterday about the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Program—that, in a short period of time, it had done a remarkable job and had already succeeded. That, of course, is clearly untrue. We all understand that we still have chronic shortages of GPs and specialists in regional and rural areas. We understand the ageing of the workforce and the changing needs of the health workforce and what that will lead to. We understand the rise of preventable illnesses, such as diabetes type 2, obesity and liver and kidney failure. We recognise the changing demographics of this country and how that will impact on our health needs. Having an organisation like Health Workforce Australia to plan how we respond to those changing needs is incredibly important, because, if you discover that there is a shortage in one area, it takes a country 10 years to actually train from scratch the expertise that it needs to respond to that shortage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that in parallel to this abolition of Health Workforce Australia—which would address those training needs in the long run—the current government have also made it easier for people to come in on 457s. So perhaps their intention is to return to the Howard years, when the training needs of the health workforce were not being met and the solution was to bring health professionals in from elsewhere. While we probably as a nation of our size will always need to do that, if it is possible to look far enough ahead for Australians to actually be trained in the fields that we require, that is a far better option for our people and for the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to talk about this notion that abolishing Health Workforce Australia is about efficiency and cost reduction. The current government has a very strange concept of cost, in that for them it seems that the only cost that matters is the bottom line of the federal government. But in the system of federalism that we have, where we have six states and a Commonwealth government, in order to reduce costs across the nation, in order to make the nation more efficient, in order to reduce the nation's costs, you actually have to do it in a way which does not just transfer the cost from one government jurisdiction to another. When Health Workforce Australia was first formed it pulled the roles from those states into a central place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it reduced duplication and inefficiency in the planning mechanism for our health workforce and created a more efficient system for the nation. True, it was an additional cost for the federal government but it was a reduction in costs for many of the departments around the states, and I would say also a reduction in costs for people who had invested considerable time in their health workforce training through university who were finding it very difficult to get clinical placements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, you cannot look at reducing costs and efficiency without looking at how your policy impacts on the costs for families and the budgets of students. We knew back in 2008 and we still know that there are areas of the workforce where people are graduating from the university component of their training and finding it incredibly difficult to get the clinical placements they need. If we as a nation are supporting the training of health professionals through an extremely complex and expensive university course only to leave them sitting idle out of the health workforce because they cannot get that all-important clinical placement, the waste and inefficiency is quite extraordinary. It is not on the bottom line of the government—this government seems to care about its own bottom line—but it is on one of the bottom lines that forms the wealth of this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In one of my earlier lives I worked at the Australia Council. One of the jobs I had quite early on was to reduce the paperwork burden for our many clients. I managed to do that quite considerably. I introduced a number of mechanisms which substantially reduced the reporting requirements—and through the application process as well. One of the things you learn early on when you set about doing that is that the easiest path you can take is to move the cost to someone else and the most difficult path you can take, which is the most effective, is to make the costs disappear completely by making an element of the work unnecessary. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, strangely enough for a government which talks about efficiency and cost cutting, takes that easy approach. It improves the federal government's bottom line by transferring the inefficiency and the cost through to state governments and to people who engage in study, who may not be able to find the clinical placement that will allow them to give back that investment by the taxpayer and their families in their education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is always worth looking at the views of stakeholders when a government puts up a proposal such as this because it is quite common when governments suggest abolishing something that looks like regulation that the field will say, 'Yes, good idea, let's go there.' If we listen to the government, they seem to believe that everybody wants the removal of all regulation, regardless of whether it has a benefit. But, if you look at the comments made by the major interest groups, there is almost universal support for the work that Health Workforce Australia has done. There are the usual small concerns about clarify of purpose where there might be duplication with a federal department, all things which the stakeholders say can be easily fixed, but overwhelmingly the support is there. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest </span>prepared by the Parliamentary Library there is quite a lengthy report on the positions of major interest groups, which states: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A Medical Observer article following the Budget quoted medical experts who condemned the proposal to merge General Practice Education and Training with Health Workforce Australia (HWA) and consolidate them into the health department.  In the view of the President of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Liz Marles, ‘the move would risk destabilising general practice training’. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Public Health Association chair, Michael Moore, labelled the plan short-sighted. Moore argued that the merged organisations would not have the same independence nor influence if they were combined with the health department. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Professor Simon Willcock, who has sat on the boards of both organisations, also pointed to the good work HWA had done in developing databases and around workforce projections and lamented that it would be a shame to see all that work not continue.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and where again an incredible lack of certainty about what this change means for the work that Health Workforce Australia is doing. She also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… there are also risks that some valuable and cost-effective activities being undertaken by these agencies will cease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the 2013 election, the Australian Medical Association made comment on a whole range of coalition policies. The AMA is traditionally supportive of conservative policies but it said clearly prior to the 2013 election that it would 'oppose any cuts to the planning and analysis done by Health Workforce Australia'. After the election, in October 2013, Australian Medical Association President, Steve Hambleton, emphasised the value of Health Workforce Australia during a meeting with health minister, Peter Dutton. It is worth noting that the AMA continues to support the work done by and the existence of Health Workforce Australia. As I said earlier, there are some small criticisms occasionally of agency’s recommendations and some questioning of duplication, but they are things that a good government would set about fixing, things that a good government would set about making stronger. A good government would look at the efficiencies that have been gained since this organisation was formed back in 2009 and build on them. A good government would work to improve the efficiency of our training spend in the areas of the health workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In spite of comments from government members that the whole thing has been fixed now and we can abolish this organisation because it did such an extraordinary job in four years that it is no longer necessary, we know that that is not the case. Australia is one of the least self-sufficient nations among comparable OECD countries in terms of meeting our health workforce needs through domestic training efforts. Part of that is because of the decisions the Howard government made to cap training places for doctors and we in government dramatically increased the number of places for both doctors and nurses and the number of clinical places as those people moved through the university to try to address that, yet we remain even now, some 10 years later, a country that is not as self-sufficient as many other comparable nations in the domestic training efforts for our health workforce. Immigrant health workers in OECD countries, in the broader context of highly skilled migration, are incredibly important, as they are in Australia. But we can lift our game in the training of Australians, for these incredibly important jobs in an area that is only going to grow as our population increases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a second issue which we need to address as well, which is the decline in GP proceduralists as a proportion of the total GP workforce, particularly in regional, rural and remote areas—from 24 per cent in 2002 to 12 per cent in 2000. That is an extraordinary halving of the proportion of GP proceduralists in regional, rural and remote areas. We also know that there is a growing gap, for example, between the fees that GPs are paid and the fees that specialists are paid, which means that fewer and fewer people remain in the GP area and more and more move into specialist areas. That is an issue which will affect our capacity to serve our population in primary health care and in many ways to keep our population healthy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a mistake to abolish Health Workforce Australia. It was formed in 2009 after a Productivity Commission report back in 2005, at the request of all of the state governments and the federal government at the time. It is serving an incredibly valuable purpose in ensuring that our health workforce is appropriate to the needs of the country. It is doing it incredibly well. Its work is not done, and it should be left alone to do its incredibly important work.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:24</span>):  Having spent three years throughout the course of the 43rd Parliament trying to wreck this joint, the Prime Minister now in government is determined to wreck the country. There is much bad news in budget—bad news for pensioners, bad news for the unemployed, bad news for families, bad news for motorists and particularly bad news for those in rural and regional Australia. But I cannot think, frankly, of anything more threatening to those in rural and regional Australia than a diminution of our health workforce planning. There is no greater role for any government than the provision of affordable healthcare services to its people. Nothing, maybe other than the defence of the country, is more important for the broad community. The abolition of Health Workforce Australia is a backward step which undermines our capacity as a country to properly plan our health workforce and therefore properly deliver health services to our people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an ageing population in our health workforce, like so many areas of our economy, and that is posing a bigger challenge than ever before. There was a Productivity Commission report—and I know those who sit opposite, including the Minister for the Environment at the table, are fans of the Productivity Commission, as, I am happy to say, am I. This was not a lightning bolt idea from the former government. Health Workforce Australia was a considered policy proposal first from the PC and then of course considered by COAG. In other words, it was an agreement by the then Labor government here in Canberra and each of the state governments around the country, because it was a good idea. It was a good idea to, for the first time, have some real policy based strategies for our workforce issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate for many, many years—the first 10 years, almost, of my 18 years in this place—there was no bigger issue than the capacity of people to see a GP. People who live in the capital cities, including people in this place, would not understand this concept. In most capital cities there is a doctor, a GP, on just about every corner. It is the reason bulk-billing rates are so much healthier in the capital cities—in most areas, at least. That is, there is competition amongst GPs. We are lucky just to see a GP in rural Australia. But, thankfully, with the advent of the Rudd government in 2007 that situation dramatically improved. It improved because of initiatives of the former Labor government. It improved because we have taken health workforce planning by the nose and done something about the issues. Today, I am happy to say, in places like Cessnock, Maitland and right throughout the upper Hunter—although it is not always easy, still, to see a GP and bulk-billing rates are not what I would like them to be—things are much better than they were for the first 10 years I was in this place, including throughout the period the now Prime Minister was minister for health, an appalling period in health policy in my opinion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just GPs and the capacity to see them; it is the training of GPs. I have always said the best way to ensure that bush communities, rural communities, have a GP or two, and hopefully three, is to train people from the bush—the people who are most likely to go back and live and practise in the bush. That is why we were making sure more rural students had an opportunity to do medicine. We were funding the training of more nurses and other clinicians, and I fear this is all going to be unravelled as a result of this government's approach to health planning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I fear for our Medicare Locals. When a doctor unexpectedly leaves a rural town in my electorate, I go to the Medicare Local. They are the people who understand the structure of our health workforce in the Hunter Valley. They are the people who know where to go, whose door to knock on, to find a replacement doctor, to provide the relevant incentives et cetera. If Medicare Locals go, it will be a big hit on GP services in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This goes to another point. It is a point I made in this place yesterday. If you cut $80 billion out of the budgets of the states, it will have ramifications and knock-on effects. I am asking myself whether the state government in New South Wales is today willing to pledge, despite these cuts from the Commonwealth, that it will maintain all the public health services in my electorate that we have enjoyed up to this point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I fear for Kurri Kurri Hospital, for example, which has been a marginal hospital because of the size of the town but is a hospital that delivers important local community services, including some specialist services. Will the New South Wales state government agree today that Kurri Kurri Hospital or any other hospital in my electorate will be protected despite these massive cuts? And it is a question that all those who sit opposite and represent rural and regional areas should be asking their Prime Minister today—the member for Braddon and the member for Eden-Monaro. I should say that the member for Eden-Monaro at least had the courage to talk on this bill—one of only four on his side. He was one of only four in here defending this, despite their huge backbench—one of only four backbenchers in here prepared to back this proposal to abolish Health Workforce Australia. I want a guarantee from both the Prime Minister and the New South Wales Premier that no public health services will be reduced in my electorate as a result of both that $80 billion worth of cuts and what they are doing in this particular bill. I am opposed to this bill absolutely. It is a backward step, and it should be rejected.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on an important matter but saddened that the occasion that brings us to the chamber to discuss health workforce needs is the proposed abolition of this agency. I take the opportunity to congratulate the member for Kingston and shadow parliamentary secretary for health for the great work that she has done in bringing before the House the egregious dangers that are contained within the Health Workforce Australia (Abolition) Bill 2014, because it warrants a great deal of scrutiny—a lot more scrutiny, I have to say, than we are able to have, because members of the government's own backbench, as the member for Hunter has pointed out, do not have the courage or the wherewithal to come in here and talk about their own government's proposal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to the whole nation to get and keep doctors, nurses and allied health professionals, but nowhere is it more important than in rural and regional Australia. It is important because regional Australians experience poorer health outcomes compared to their fellow Australians in metropolitan Australia. Regional Australians have a higher rate of injury, arthritis, obesity and melanoma, a higher incidence of suicide and a higher incidence of chronic diseases such as diabetes. They have a greater tendency to smoke, to drink and to engage in riskier behaviours. They have poorer survival rates for cancer and a shorter life expectancy, anywhere between one and seven years less, the further away you get from a major urban centre.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With these stubborn facts in mind, you would think that more effort would be put into addressing the maldistribution of doctors, nurses and allied health professionals between city and country. In the major cities, Deputy Speaker, you will be surprised to know that you can find about 220 specialists per 100,000 of the population. But, if you move into regional areas like my own or even further out into the bush, you will see that ratio drop to 48 in 100,000. Just compare the two. Focus on that for a moment: 220 specialists per 100,000 people in the city; 48 per 100,000 in the bush. And, for hospital non-specialists, in the major cities there are 41 per 100,000 compared to just 18 per 100,000 in outer regional areas. So a national health workforce strategy to address the workforce pipeline, the supply of medical professionals and health professionals, particularly into regional and rural Australia, is absolutely critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The health workforce is under tremendous pressure, and it is only going to get worse, in part because of the very measures that are being debated before the House today. Today there are about 1.3 million Australians who work in the Australian health industry, according to the 2011 census. That is about six per cent of the total workforce. We have an ageing population on the other side of the ledger, and that is going to bring in significant health needs. By 2050, there will be 2.7 people of working age to support every Australian above the age of 65. We know we have a problem now, but if we look into the future—and it is the not-too-distant future—we know that we have a significant problem, because we know that there is an increased usage, particularly in the primary care space, by older people when it comes to accessing health services. If we think we have an issue now, we have not seen anything yet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not a new problem. It is not as if this is the first time that this parliament has been apprised of the issue. It is not, because in 2005 the then Howard government commissioned the Productivity Commission to inquire into this issue, in part because of the pressure that was put upon them by the then Labor opposition. They commissioned a report, and the report was published on 22 December 2005. Amongst the many conclusions, it said that there would 'continue to be poor health outcomes in particular regions and for particular groups'. It said workforce strategies and 'inflexibilities and inefficiencies' in workforce arrangements are 'major contributors to these problems'. The Howard government commissioned the report. It came up with the answers, but the government sat on the report and did not listen to the answers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wind the clock forward. On winning government in 2007, the then Rudd government made addressing these issues one of its highest priorities. We knew that we could not do it alone. We knew that we had to work together with the state governments and the territory governments, which have principal responsibility for delivery, particularly in relation to hospital care. So we worked through the health ministers council and through COAG to ensure that we could get a coordinated response. We knew it needed to be a national, large-scale response which was cross-jurisdictional. We also knew that we had to work with the relevant professional bodies. That is why today Health Workforce Australia is partnered with state and territory governments, with higher education institutions and the professional training sector, with healthcare bodies, with employers and with all the professional and regulatory bodies to ensure that we are working together to address the health workforce needs now and into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can say there was some success. We know that any of the things you do in this space take some time to turn around because of the long time it takes to take somebody from high school through university, through professional training and then into the health workforce. We did see an improvement under Labor: 74 per cent of Australia faced a medical workforce shortage when we took office in 2007 but by the time we left office the distribution of GPs had improved across regional areas. This was a tremendous achievement, but we definitely had our challenges because of the deliberate decisions of the now Prime Minister, when he was health minister, to effectively put a cap, a lid, on the number of new GPs entering the system. We had a big hole to fill, a big job to do, but significant steps forward were made, particularly due to the work we were able to put in place through Health Workforce Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We knew that we needed one strategy, not five, six, seven or eight, because Australians know that wherever they live they should have access to a decent health service and to a GP or primary healthcare provider. It should not matter whether you are living in Queensland or Tasmania, in the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory, we need a national strategy to address these shortages. We made agreements with the states and territories and tackled the burden of resolving this monumental problem, rather than leave it to each state and territory to go their different ways trying to resolve it on their own. So Health Workforce Australia has led the way nationally and that has been paying off. We have produced the first national long-term projections for doctors, nurses and midwives, because if you do not know what the problem is you are not going to know what the solution will be. We have funded over 8½ thousand new quality clinical training places for students across different disciplines. We have supported a 115 per cent increase in simulation education hours and delivered 446 nurses and allied health workers to regional communities. In addition, we have improved the national coordination of medical training with the National Medical Training Advisory Network. None of this would have happened without the work of Health Workforce Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We knew this was all under threat with the election of a coalition government, but there was cause for some hope, particularly in rural and regional Australia. When people in rural and regional Australia looked at the various candidates they were going to vote for and considered their policy options they may have had a look at the National Party health platform and gained some hope from statements such as this in the Nationals' policy:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We will enhance incentives for doctors and health professionals to take up regional practice and stay there. And we will go further with the advent of a dedicated Federal Minister for Regional Health to specifically oversee regional healthcare and the needs of regional patients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That must have given them some hope, if that was what they were going to do. And when the platform talks about the role of the minister for regional health it says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When health policy decisions are being made regional concerns must be championed by a dedicated Minister with regional experience and a primary focus on the welfare of regional Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who read that and voted on that policy platform must feel devastated. If they were listening to budget estimates a few nights ago they would have heard their minister for rural and regional health confess under questioning from a Labor senator that she had not even been consulted on the rural and regional impact of the GP tax and that she was not interested enough in this issue and its impact on rural and regional Australia to ask the department to do some research or modelling on the issue. You would have thought the party that is dedicated to representing the interests of rural and regional Australia, apprised of the maldistribution of doctors and allied health professionals and apprised of the discrepancies in health outcomes for rural and regional Australians when compared to their brothers and sisters and cousins in the city, would at least be taking some interest in the impact of the GP tax and the other healthcare changes on rural and regional Australians. What we see is a complete lack of interest. What we see is National Party failure and ministerial failure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the government's answer on this? We see with the bill before the House that part of their answer is to abolish the only Commonwealth agency which is focused on addressing workforce shortages in the health professional area, particularly in rural and regional Australia. But that is not where they stop. It seems they have got three bows to their answer to workforce shortages in the health industry. The first is to abolish the agency which is overseeing. The second is to make it harder to get a medical education: slash the per capita funding to universities, with a 20 per cent cut on average in funding to universities, including to regional universities that have a medical school; take the lid off student fees, which we all know is going to lead to an increase in fees; and double the rates you pay on your student debt. What is the impact of this going to be on medical students? The vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne says that he expects significant increases. A medical degree currently costs a student about $80,000 for the life of that degree. That price will go up to anywhere between $100,000 and $183,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who come from a regional area and those who have a great university like the University of Wollongong, which runs a postgraduate medical degree, will know that if somebody is giving up a job, perhaps already incurring a student debt and going back to university to take up postgraduate medicine, this will be a massive disincentive for new doctors, new nurses, new allied health professionals to take up a course of study which will lead them to becoming a health professional. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are abolishing the only agency and they are making it harder and more expensive for somebody to train to be a health professional. Their answer, effectively, is to let the market rip. We know what happens when the market rips in the area of health workforce distribution. You can see as many doctors as you like in Bondi, but try to see a doctor in Dubbo or west of there and you will see the disparities. This is bad legislation, built on a bad plan and it should be rejected.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  The Health Workforce Australia (Abolition) Bill 2014 before the House seeks to repeal the Health Workforce Australia Act 2009 and to absorb this agency and its functions into the Department of Health. We will see the important work done by this agency transferred. My concern about this bill is simple: it seeks to water down the important role that the Australian government plays in national health workforce planning. This bill seeks to undo the good work that has been done by the previous government in tackling this important area. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This agency is an independent body and it works collaboratively with a number of agencies, stakeholders, and has direct links with states and territories, which is vital. We on this side of the parliament acknowledge that states, territories and the federal government are in partnership when it comes to meeting the health needs of our community. National health workforce planning is critical to addressing the looming crisis that we have not just within our cities but within our country when it comes to having the workforce we need to ensure that we are meeting the health needs of people wherever they live.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it is so important that we have a national plan. We need to acknowledge that the training that is done of these health professionals is largely the responsibility of our national federal government. Yet where these people work is in the states. That is why it is so important that we have an independent body to bring those stakeholders together, to bring levels of government together and to ensure that we have the workforce in training and ready to meet the health needs of our future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past, the result of the reactive approach to medical and nursing training, immigration and workforce overseas recruitment was a metro-dominated distribution of health professionals. This has affected regional areas like mine in ensuring that we have the health professionals to meet the health concerns of people in our region. We still have health workforce challenges, particularly in country areas. Workforce recruitment is tough. It is more expensive than in metropolitan cities. Retention remains one of the key issues and a major challenge and it is another reason why it is so important that we have a strong long-term plan and an agency to do that work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst it is important that we acknowledge that recruitment is an issue, it is just as important that we have a strong plan to retain health professionals in rural and remote areas. As the distance from metropolitan areas increases, the retention of rural health professionals becomes more problematic. Rural communities are currently unable to recruit and retain the health professionals that they need and, as a result, we are seeing access to health services as a problem. We are seeing poorer health standards in our regional communities. One measure that speaks to this problem so loudly and so clearly is the lower life expectancy of people living in rural and particularly remote areas. As my friend the member for Mallee quite often states in the media publicly—and on any occasion that he can—people living in regional Victoria have a life expectancy of 4.7 years less than people living in major cities. One reason is not being able to access affordable and available health care and having their health professionals in their town and communities when they need them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we focus specifically on medical practitioners, GPs and specialists: is there a shortage in regional areas? The answer is yes. Quite often, when I am out in the smaller towns in central Victoria I talk to people and they tell me stories about how the books of their doctor—for example, in Heathcote—are full. They cannot get into the books. They have to travel to Bendigo to visit a GP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The difference between the number of specialists in the city and country is also a major issue. Data released by the National Rural Health Alliance speaks to this difference. In major cities there are roughly 134 specialists per 100,000 population. Yet compare that to inner regional areas where there are 63 per 100,000 and, in outer regional areas, 43 per 100,000 population. It is a huge difference. Then we compound that by the distances in our remote and regional areas and the travel that is required. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only on the weekend was I speaking to people, talking about how they constantly travel to Melbourne and about the associated out-of-pocket costs for people living in Bendigo and further out from Bendigo by having to travel to Melbourne to see their specialist. That is because we do not have enough specialists in the regions. It is important that we tackle these issues. That is another reason why we need one agency that is independent nationally, such as Health Workforce Australia, addressing these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the cities there are ample opportunities for GPs and specialists to work in private practice, to work in corporate practices, to be salaried in hospital positions or work in bulk-billing medical services. In the bush there are not the same opportunities for doctors and this is one of the reasons why we believe we have such an issue when it comes to retaining and recruiting doctors. Our doctors just do not have the same opportunities. There is also more expected of them, which again makes it harder to recruit people to the area. Take, for example, our small hospitals in my electorate. In Castlemaine, Heathcote and Kyneton, local GPs are expected to be on the on-call roster for their local hospital. In Castlemaine and Heathcote it works quite well. However, there is currently a problem in Kyneton, a dispute which has meant that the current hospital does not have local GPs on the roster in rotation. Again, what we need is workforce planning not just at a state level but at a federal level to ensure that we have enough doctors in the places that need them. Understanding planning for the health workforce is vital if as a nation we are going to resolve and solve the ongoing GP issues across regional Australia. It sounds like a task for a health agency that is an independent body that works collaboratively with a number of key stakeholders and has direct links with states and territories, just like the agency that this bill seeks to abolish. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just with GPs where we have a critical area to look at, it is also allied health professionals. Many regional and rural communities, including my own, struggle to attract the staff that they need for allied health. A study by Monash University made a number of significant findings in this particular area. Annual turnover in regional areas for allied health professionals was on average 35 per cent whilst in the city it was only 28 per cent. Retention rates were also an issue: on average in the city 12 months after starting it was 82 per cent, yet in some of our most remote areas retention rates were as low as 64 per cent. The study also finds that the cost associated with recruiting allied health professionals to the regions was much higher. In the city it was roughly $26,000 whereas in the country it was $45,000. It is a study that speaks to policy needing to address directly not only recruitment but that funding to those agencies, those hospitals, needs to be increased to recruit. It highlights again the need to have a national framework and a national agency. It is another task for a national agency focused on health workforce planning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other problem with this bill is that it does not say anywhere that the agency is not working. We know from our previous speakers that Health Workforce Australia is working. During the last four years there are many examples of how it is working. It has established the National Medical Training Advisory Network. It has examined the barriers and the enablers to entering the workforce. It has investigated the increasing need for self-sufficiency within the medical workforce. So if the Health Workforce Australia agency is working and there is still a need for workforce planning, as I have demonstrated, particularly in regional areas, why is the government seeking to abolish this very important organisation? It can only be described as pure Liberal ideology, an ideology and an attitude that is against universal health care and against ensuring that we have equity that takes into account where you live. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This attack on universal health care is no clearer than in the moves the government made on budget night. It was not just about the abolition of this institution but also about the cruel health cuts and funding cuts to the regional areas and the new GP tax. In my electorate the hits on budget night were huge, with nearly $29 million cut from Bendigo electorate hospitals over the next five years. Bendigo Health takes the largest whack, which is $25 million to be stripped from now up to 2018. There is almost $1 million from Kyneton District Health, which is one of our small hospitals. Today Kyneton District Health will get a visit from the state Liberal Premier, although we do not know how long he will be the Premier, and he is staging a photo op at the Kyneton hospital. He is doing the first sod turn for the Kyneton ambulatory care centre. I mention this because this centre was first funded by the federal Labor government budget in 2011, yet it has taken three years for the state Liberal government to finish the planning and to get on with the job of building. Why has it taken this government so long? If it has taken three years to do the sod turn, how long till we expect the centre to be open? This delay smacks of a deliberate political decision to give the Premier an opportunity to stand in front of a project with his candidates in an election year. We are months away from an election and its speaks volumes about the politics of the Liberals and the politics of our state government and our federal government. It is politics before the health of central Victorians, it is politics and ideology before the health workforce of central Victorians.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having worked closely with paramedics and nurses in Central Victoria, I know the commitment that they make to our region. Currently in regional Victoria we are in the midst of an ambos crisis. We do not have enough paramedics working in the area. This is another area where we need workforce planning. When you talk to nurses at the Bendigo Health or at our small hospitals, they speak of the worry that when they retire there are not enough younger nurses coming into the hospitals to replace them. This is another area where we need workforce planning. When you look at the people who are taking up the specialist nursing courses, like midwifery and so on, it is again another area where we need workforce planning. I suppose you do not want to do the planning if you know fewer people will be going into those training courses, because of the exorbitant fees they will have to pay to complete their courses. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, what we have seen is the good work being done by Health Workforce Australia. It is improving our services. We are seeing that it is tackling the issues in our regional areas. We are seeing that it is ensuring that students have the best possible training and that models of care are being delivered in the most appropriate ways. This is an agency with purpose. It is an agency achieving its goals, yet this bill seeks to abolish it. This bill speaks as another example of Liberal ideology; it is another cruel cut from budget night that will not only put the health of all Australians at risk but also make it harder for people in regional Victoria to seek the professional help, the medical help they need and when they need it. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  As many of us recall, 26 March was 'red tape repeal day'—by any measure, a red letter day for this government, business operators and workers from all across the country. This government has a very clear objective when it comes to red tape. As it is very clearly outlined in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Government Guide to Regulation</span>, this government seeks to ensure that regulation is never adopted as the default solution but rather is introduced as a means of last resort. The Health Workforce Australia (Abolition) Bill 2014 is another step on the way towards the government achieving its goal of stripping away unnecessary and wasteful red tape. The bill is intended to streamline the delivery of health workforce policy and programs by removing an unnecessary level of administration and bureaucracy that currently weighs down this very important component of health service delivery. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott government has detailed 10 principles for Australian government policymakers that should drive policy development now and into the future. Mr Deputy Speaker, I will share those with you so that they are on the record. No.1, regulation should not be the default option for policy makers. The policy option offering the greatest net benefit should always be the recommended option. No. 2, regulation should be imposed only when it can be shown to offer an overall net benefit. No. 3, the cost benefit of new regulation must be fully offset by reductions in existing regulatory burden. No. 4, every substantive regulatory policy change must be the subject of a regulation impact statement. No. 5, policymakers should consult in a genuine and timely way with affected businesses, community organisations and individuals. No. 6, policymakers must consult with each other to avoid creating cumulative or overlapping regulatory burdens. No. 7, the information upon which policymakers base their decisions must be published at the earliest opportunity. No. 8, regulators must implement regulation with common sense, empathy and respect. No. 9, all regulations must be periodically reviewed to test its continuing relevance. Finally, No. 10, policymakers must work closely with their portfolio deregulation units throughout the policymaking process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a fairly safe bet that if these guidelines had been followed the Health Workforce Australia legislation would never have made it through the House. Over the past six Labor administrations, the health bureaucracy continued to increase in size, with no immediately obvious improvements in the delivery of health services. At last count, there were 21 stand-alone agencies operating outside the actual portfolio department. A bureaucracy of that size incurs significant costs to build up and maintain. This diverts much-needed resources from areas that directly benefit patients. The coalition government is determined to get every possible dollar away from administration and the bureaucratic process and back into front-line services, and the passage of this bill will assist in achieving this aim. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health Workforce Australia, or HWA, was established under the now expired four-year National Partnership Agreement on Hospital and Health Workforce Reform, agreed by the Council of Australian Governments in November 2008. It is worth remembering that back in 2008, nationally, I think there was only one non-Labor government in power in Australia—and that is a sure-fire recipe for unnecessary regulation to bind the smooth operation of the bureaucracy. HWA was established to provide financial and other support for the delivery of clinical training and to carry out research, as well as to collect, analyse, and publish data relating to the health workforce. In addition, it was charged with developing and evaluating strategies for the development of the health workforce. It became operational in January 2010. All Australian governments were intended to provide funding to HWA; however, the states and territories have not contributed any funding, as was agreed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth government has been the sole funder of HWA, committing $1.05 billion since its establishment. This is approximately $250 million a year, with no contribution from the jurisdictions. Should this bill be passed, programs and functions of the HWA will transfer to the Department of Health, which, I am advised, has the capacity to fulfil the agency's function. This government is not withdrawing support for the health workforce—far from it. It is, however, delivering on its commitment to reduce red tape and streamline programs. Savings will support front-line health services and programs—and what is really important here is front-line health services. It is what health funding should be doing—that is, putting resources into front-line health services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has a strong record on making sensible investments in Australia's health and medical workforce. The previous Howard government invested in nine new medical schools, which have resulted in an increase in medical students graduating right now. I am further advised that the number of domestic school graduates per year has more than doubled since 1996. The Northern Territory Remote Clinical School with sites in Alice Springs, Katherine and Nhulunbuy was founded in 2005 and is part of the Northern Territory Medical Program. This initiative is run by Flinders University. It aims to give students the opportunity to take training in rural environments and also offers support to health professionals working in these remote teaching locations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition and, in particular, the health minister are committed to providing proper and responsible training for health practitioners. This government has committed to a doubling of the Practice Incentive Program payment, from $100 to $200 for each three-hour teaching session provided to a medical student. This provision directly benefits the teacher and will better compensate general practices for the consultation time they dedicate to teaching. It will also encourage more general practitioners to provide much-needed teaching opportunities and will work to strengthen the future workforce. Approximately 3,000 practices are expected to provide PIP teaching sessions, which translates to about 20,000 students every year. A rural loading of up to 50 per cent will also be applied to payments to practices in rural and remote locations, which will be a fitting reward for the legion of GPs who service the Territory's bush centres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is also investing $40 million in up to 100 additional medical internships each year in non-traditional settings, including private hospitals in regional areas. This will provide more certainty for students and alleviate pressure on public hospital training. I will certainly be working with the Darwin Private Hospital, in my electorate of Solomon, to secure some placements. I welcome the fact that priority will be given to positions and rotations outside major metropolitan centres. That is a welcome development, and I will make it my work to ensure that it works to the advantage of Territorians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will provide infrastructure grants to general practices on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The intention is to leverage private investment and help ensure the efficient and productive use of resources. This is in stark contrast to the wasteful GP superclinic program, which saw promises and taxpayer dollars literally splashed around with precious little accountability to monitor what exactly was going on. The government has also committed to providing up to 175 grants for rural and remote general practices to expand facilities to support the teaching and training of medical students and registrars. This will be particularly beneficial when the construction of the Palmerston Hospital is completed. The grants of up to $300,000 will be provided to successful applicants and, again, will require a matched contribution from the practice. This measure will benefit the GPs, registrars, medical students and communities in regional remote and very remote Australia, where these grants will be targeted. It goes without saying that these practices face unusual challenges in the delivery of health services and health care, and it would be a great opportunity for medical students to experience life in rural or remote health practices. I hope it will also encourage students to pursue careers outside the comfort of metropolitan areas once they graduate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another measure which I hope will benefit families in Darwin and Palmerston is the planned expansion of GP training places. Australia wide, GP training places will increase by 300—from 1,200 to 1,500—in 2015. This will create more vocational training opportunities for this workforce and free up more junior doctor training positions for new graduates who are coming through. The Australian General Practice Training Program, which this commitment will expand, has a distribution target that requires half of training to occur in rural and remote locations. This government is making sensible changes to reduce the waste of duplication and bureaucracy so that sustainable investments can continue to be made in services or programs that benefit our health system and the future workforce. This can only work to the benefit of families, pensioners and workers in Darwin and Palmerston.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  If this was good legislation, coalition members would be tripping over themselves to come into this chamber and speak in support of it. Instead we have seen only a handful of them bother to do so—probably because they know they can defend neither this legislation nor the $50 billion of cuts in health spending that the Abbott government brought in in its first budget. This is one of only several cuts made by the Abbott government in that budget. Having gone to the 2013 election promising not to cut health spending—in addition to a range of other promises—the Abbott government has now managed through this budget to unite people from across Australia. Regardless of political leanings, regardless of whether we are talking about community groups or even political groups such as the premiers of the various states, people from across Australia are united in condemnation of this government's $50 billion of cuts to health spending across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the criticisms are not confined to politicians and other levels of government. The Rural Doctors Association has issued press statements critical of the health program cuts. The AMA has issued similar critiques. Yesterday I received the May 2014 bulletin of the Australian Dental Association. I will quote the last two sentences of the bulletin:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All in all, funding the dental care has been less impacted than other areas of health. Nonetheless, the losses outweigh the gains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I repeat the words 'less impacted than other areas of health' and 'the losses outweigh the gains'. This is a non-political and independent analysis of spending in respect to the dental areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The South Australian Health Alliance—an alliance of South Australia's leading health unions, health consumer groups, community groups and service providers—have come out strongly with their concerns about the Abbott government's cuts to health programs. I can understand that; particularly coming from South Australia, I am aware that the federal government has cut funding to South Australia by $655 million over the four-year budget forecasts. This is made up of $444 million in cuts to specific purpose payments, $120 million of cuts to national partnership agreement funding for public hospitals, $42 million of cuts to national partnership agreements funding for financial assistance for longstay patients and $50 million of cuts in other health initiatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation seeks to repeal the Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009 and transfer Health Workforce Australia's functions into the Department of Health. It has already been stated by the member the Kingston that most of those losses will occur in South Australia, and so it is not at all surprising to hear the concerns of the South Australian Health Alliance. Transferring a program to an existing department may sound like a reasonable thing to do—particularly if it really is going to save public funding; under those circumstances, it could be defended. However, a close analysis of this decision to axe Health Workforce Australia will show that it is short-sighted. It is a decision that will ultimately result in more costs being incurred and no national coordination of planning and training Australia's future health workforce. That in turn will reduce Australia's ability to deliver the very high standard of health services across the country that we would all expect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of this legislation will be that the responsibility for planning and training Australia's health professionals will fall onto the individual states, as it was prior to the legislation coming into effect. It will result in an uncoordinated, piecemeal approach, rather than a coordinated national approach. The approach we currently have and the legislation that currently covers Health Workforce Australia resulted from a Productivity Commission report of 2006—a report initiated by the Howard government, but not implemented by it. When Labor came to office, we implemented it because we needed a national approach to preparing and planning the medical and health workforce for this country. With the implementation of Health Workforce Australia we have for the first time reliable statistics and reliable projections of the numbers of doctors, nurses and midwives that we need into the future. That in turn enables us to plan for the training of the health professionals that are required to take the place of those who retire or otherwise get out of the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday the Rural Doctors Association issued a media release, warning that the Abbott government's decision to shut down that general practice education and training will erode the high-quality GP training that new medical graduates currently receive. According to the release:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have very high standards in Australia for the selection and training of GPs, and this been developed over many years. In many respects, Australia's GP training system is the envy of many other countries. It is crucial that these standards are maintained and not destroyed overnight simply because the current government wants to get the budget back into surplus in the shortest possible time frame. This would be a false economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Rural Doctors Association, I believe, reflects the views of people in country areas broadly and certainly reflects the views of those doctors who are working in country areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been one of the challenges of state governments in this country for a long time to try to ensure that we get enough health professionals in country areas. It has never been easy; it has been very difficult. We have tried to provide incentives for health professionals to do so, but I am aware of many country towns that are still struggling to get the health professionals they need. Just when it appears that we are making some progress through programs that are currently in place, the government comes along and says, 'We are going to cut those programs.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not surprising that the Rural Doctors Association is very concerned about the cuts and is raising concerns. These are the people that you would expect to know most about health services in their communities, and yet the government clearly is not listening to what they are saying. I would have thought that any good minister and any good government would take advice from the very bodies that know most about the issues they are dealing with. But that is simply not the case here, because the government is prepared to put budget cuts ahead of the needs of communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This policy comes on top of a series of other cuts to health services made by the Abbott government. Only yesterday we learnt that $9.9 million has also been cut from the training of nursing and allied health students in Tasmania: nursing scholarships will cease from 1 July of this year and allied health scholarships from 1 July 2015. Yesterday in this House we also saw the abolition of the Australian National Preventive Health Agency—another short-sighted decision by the Abbott government. Health preventive programs inevitably have a substantial cost saving for our health system and for the nation. It is much more cost-effective to prevent illness than to treat it. That should be understood by all. It is a common theme and a common message from all health professionals: prevention is better than cure. We have a process and a system in place that the government, again, has chosen to disband or move to another department. It is incredibly short-sighted, and it is not surprising that so many health organisations across the country have come out in condemnation of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With these decisions that the government are claiming will save money now, inevitably health costs will be compounded and transferred into the future. The government are transferring those additional costs to future governments and future generations. Of course, the government, and the Minister for Health, who I see is in the chamber, will not be around to wear those future health costs; they will be someone else's problem. That is not responsible government. Responsible government is about doing the right thing for today's generation and for future generations.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 1.3 million Australians working in the health sector. It is a major employment sector. It needs good management to make sure that it is balanced and well supported. When Labor was elected in 2007 the health workforce was in total disarray. There was no national strategy or planning for future needs. We had a shortage of health professionals across several health professions. We had a great deal of difficulty in getting GPs and other health professionals to work in country areas. We had a frustrating process in place for international medical graduates to have their qualifications recognised in Australia and then be cleared to work as health professionals in the country. I can recall raising this matter on several occasions and I can recall meeting with several health professionals in my own office. All of them expressed their frustration at having their qualifications properly recognised so that they could take up the job they had been offered but which they were not able to do until they had been cleared. We had the Howard government even threatening to take over hospitals, starting with the Mersey hospital in Tasmania. There was also a limitation on the number of medical places that were made available to students within our universities. This highlights just how chaotic the health system was when we came to office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party set about reforming the process and the system. Many of the reforms we introduced have made the system better. It is only a relatively short period of time that those reforms have been in place, but they are already making a difference. Following the election of the Abbott government, the first thing it is doing is dismantling everything that has been put in place and cutting $50 billion in health funding on top of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard the denials from the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health about cuts to health funding by the federal government. Their problem is that nobody believes their denials. Their problem is that all of those who have studied the budget and who need to know exactly what is in it for them have come out in condemnation of the government. The government's problem is that none of the premiers believe their spin that there are no cuts to health spending in this country. None of the professionals around the country that work in the health sector believe their spin that there has not been $50 billion of cuts to the country. And none of the people that I speak to in my community, as I get around, believe their spin that there has not been $50 billion of cuts to health spending in this budget over the forward estimates. The government's problem is that they know that they have made cuts that are going to deeply hurt the Australian community and deeply hurt the health profession more broadly. It knows those decisions are not popular. No amount of spin, no amount of weasel words and no amount of denial by the minister when he comes into this place will change the fact that health spending in this budget has been cut by $50 billion and that that will have devastating effects for people right around the country.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Minister for Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:26</span>):  I thank all of those members who have contributed to the debate on the Health Workforce Australia (Abolition) Bill 2014. I put on record the government's firm commitment to our health workforce across the country. That was evidenced in the budget, where health funding increases year on year and hospital funding increases by nine per cent next year, nine per cent the year after, nine per cent the following year and six per cent in year 4. I say thank you, very much, to those members in particular who have pointed out the fact that when this government came to office it inherited a health portfolio that, in addition to those people who are working hard within the department, had 23 outside agencies. I point the attention of members opposite to an article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>. Ironically, its chief political correspondent and the author of the piece is Matthew Franklin, who went on to become a spin doctor for then Prime Minister Rudd. In his article Mr Franklin quotes Mr Tanner, the former Labor finance minister, as saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The indiscriminate creation of new bodies or the failure to adapt old bodies as their circumstances change increases the risk of having inappropriate governance structures,</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Tanner went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This in turn jeopardises policy outcomes and poses financial risks to the taxpayer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The article further quotes Mr Tanner as saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The more agencies you have, the more embedded fixed costs that you have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is staying true to the sentiment within Mr Tanner's contribution. Indeed, any good government would want to make sure that it had efficiency, because in the end governments are guardians of taxpayers' money. We have inherited an enormous amount of debt from the Labor Party. It is our responsibility to clean up their mess and clean it up we will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Health Workforce Australia (Abolition) Bill 2014 will close Health Workforce Australia and transfer the programs and functions of HWA to the Department of Health. The bill is not about a withdrawal of support or resources for the health workforce but about this government delivering on its commitment to remove duplication and red tape so that there can be more focus on the policies and programs that directly support our health workforce. We want to deliver a smaller and more rational government footprint. We know that without our health workforce we would have no healthcare system. We also know that there remain issues with the availability, mix and distribution of the health workforce, but another health workforce bureaucracy is not the way to address these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's policy of style and announcement over substance and delivery is on display in relation to this area. HWA has added an unnecessary level of administration and bureaucracy. Valuable resources have gone into the significant overhead costs that come with running an agency. By transferring the functions and programs of HWA to the Department of Health we can save money by reducing duplication and we can continue to support programs to build our health workforce. All priority activities will continue to be delivered. The organisations funded by HWA can be assured that all current funding agreements will be met. The Commonwealth government will continue to work with the states and territories, private health employers and the professions towards national health workforce planning and reform. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes strongly that the mining industry has an important part to play in Australia's economic prosperity. The shadow Treasurer was indeed just commenting to me during the division about his recent visit to the Santos control centre in Brisbane, and I have enjoyed many productive conversations with Australia's miners. Mining constituted 80 per cent of the growth in the last quarter, giving a lie to those who have run a scare campaign suggesting that a profits based mining tax would debilitate the mining industry. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the none-too-distant future revenue to the Commonwealth and to the States of Australia from LNG production will be greater than the revenue from iron ore. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Brand also talked about the importance of floating LNG and the innovation that comes from maritime engineering excellence, referring to the embrace of floating oil production in the Timor Sea in the 1980s and discussing the transformation that is taking place worldwide with the United States on the verge of becoming a net energy exporter for the first time since World War II. In South America, the newly widened Panama Canal opens next year, which will provide passage for an estimated 12 million tonnes of LNG a year, a thought no-one had in the planning six years ago when the work to widen the canal began. There are 16 floating LNG projects now—in Israel, Indonesia, Brazil, Canada, Mozambique and the United States. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mining industry has a strong future and we on this side of the House welcome that. We do, however, recognise that it is important that there be a fair tax regime in place. On this side of the House, we have made that case from an equity perspective. Those on the Labor side of the House tend to be more concerned about inequality than those on the coalition benches. But there is also a conservative argument for it, a Burkean argument for it. As Edmund Burke said, we are here not just for the current generation; we are informed by the generations that have gone before us and we need to make decisions for the generations to come. A fair resource tax system for minerals in the ground is absolutely fundamental to that. As Ross Garnaut noted in his excellent new book <span style="font-style:italic;">Dog </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Days</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: Australia </span><span style="font-style:italic;">After </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Boom</span>:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">More and more of the load is carried by income taxpayers with limited opportunities for avoiding taxation, and is economically distorting, unfair and probably politically unsustainable.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measure in the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2014 Measures No. 3) Bill 2014 is a sensible measure to prevent base erosion within the mining industry. It was first announced by then Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury in the 2013-14 budget. There was an Assistant Treasurer who was serious about tax reform, a man who has now taken up a senior position, not a political appointment but one won in his own right, focusing on taxation in the OECD. Yet, now, this government not only lacks an Assistant Treasurer of that calibre, it indeed has no Assistant Treasurer at all. While Arthur Sinodinos has stepped aside, the government is left with the finance minister sharing the burden of Assistant Treasurer. That cannot be the entire explanation for the government's bumbling and its hapless performance in selling this budget, but the lack of Arthur Sinodinos's voice into the budget preparation is surely part of that. On this side of the House, we support sensible measures to prevent base erosion within the mining industry. We recognise that it is important to protect the concession that allows companies to immediately deduct costs incurred in genuine exploration activity, but that in recent years it has been apparent that companies were using this deduction to claim expenses not associated with genuine exploration activities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures in this bill amount to more than a billion dollars of government revenue over the forward estimates. That is a good thing and is welcomed by this side of the House. What is less welcome is that while the government is closing this particular loophole, it is leaving many other loopholes open. More than a billion dollars has now been forgone in measures that were to tackle base erosion and profit-shifting. More than a billion dollars is around the price of a new hospital, a new hospital that could have been built if this government had been serious about tackling multinational profit-shifting. It is a government that is happy to talk the big talk in the G20. In Davos, the Prime Minister said: 'The G20 will continue to tackle business artificially generating profits to chase tax opportunities.' Fine words, but how have they been backed up in action? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the only action this government have taken on multinational tax integrity is to dump Labor's thin capitalisation reforms and to show strong signs that they are going to backtrack on the transparency measures, measures that would see the largest 200 companies in Australia publish their tax paid. It is a reasonable measure that has been certainly supported by all of the constituents whom I have spoken to about it, and reflects the fundamental notion in integrity that sunlight is the best disinfectant. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government wants to bring this secrecy back when it comes to reporting tax paid. It wants to dump measures on multinational profit-shifting. To be specific, Deputy Speaker Broadbent, because I know you like the specifics on these things, the government has dumped a measure for reform in the offshore banking unit regime, costing the forward estimates $180 million. It is not going to proceed with legislative elements of the measure to improve tax compliance through third-party reporting and data-matching, costing the budget $113.1 million. It will not proceed with changes that would have applied to multiple-entry consolidated groups, costing the budget $140 million. It will not proceed with the abolition of section 25-90, costing the budget $600 million. It will not proceed with changes to offshore banking units, costing the budget $100 million. The total of all that is $1,133.1 million. Over a billion dollars in measures that protect tax integrity have gone by the wayside from a government who say everyone has to bear the burden. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone is not bearing the burden and Australians will be rightfully outraged when they see that this is a government that is going soft on multinational profit-shifting, so it can go hard on single mums, the unemployed and pensioners. That is not sharing the burden; that is transferring resources from the most vulnerable to the most affluent in the community. It is a government that thinks it is okay to spend $40 million raising the non-concessional superannuation cap on people who put more than $150,000 a year into super. Putting it at 15 per cent a year, we are talking about people with million-dollar incomes. So the government sees fit to put aside $40 million to assist people with incomes of $1 million a year or more, while at the same time saying to unemployed Tasmanians in the north-west of Tasmania, where I visited recently with Senator Anne Urquhart, that they have to wait six months in order to get unemployment benefits—that they are to be punished, effectively, because the unemployment rate on the north-west of Tasmania is higher than the national average. It is a dreadful measure, and one which could have been averted if this government were serious about cracking down on multinational profit-shifting.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These sorts of measures are deeply concerning to the Labor members on this side of the House. The measure that we are debating today is a Labor measure, brought forward by the great tax reformer David Bradbury. And we are pleased to see it implemented—make no mistake—but we want to see the government have as much enthusiasm about closing the other tax loopholes which are currently causing the burden to fall on the most vulnerable Australians.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compared to the honest benchmark—as the member for Cook noted yesterday, the only honest benchmark—the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the budget deficit is increased this year, next year and over the forward estimates. This is a budget that breaks promises. Worst of all, it is a budget that is deeply, deeply unfair. We need a government that is serious about cracking down on multinational profit-shifting, and we do not have that government today.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="LL6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BALDWIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  I rise today to speak to the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2014 Measures No. 3) Bill 2014. This bill limits the immediate deduction for expenditure on mining, quarrying and prospecting rights, and information first used for exploration. The measure will make the cost of these rights and information deductible over 15 years or the effective life of the right or information, whichever is the shorter. This bill is intended to remove the exploration tax concession for trading of late-stage exploration rights and information where the price is expected to reflect the value of resources discovered rather than the right to explore. The measure will improve the focus of the immediate deduction on genuine exploration and on the acquisition of unexplored tenement rights from issuing authorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is very important to ensuring that the mining industry—in particular, coalmining—can continue to grow and thrive in the Hunter. The coalmining industry is a source of employment in the Hunter, and the benefits flow on to nondirect mining industries, such as mining equipment sales and manufacturing—even right down to the coffee shop that sells the miners breakfast and lunch. We need to continue to encourage the industry's leaders to search for new territory so that new opportunities can be gained for our residents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will turn now to the carbon tax and the mining tax. The Minerals Council of Australia estimates that around 10,000 jobs were lost in the past two years after prices for thermal and coking coal fell by between 50 per cent and 70 per cent. In my area this rings true, and over the past year we have read about hundreds of jobs being shed from coalmining, with only a small percentage being sent to another mine located out of the Hunter. The council also blames the carbon tax, which is an $800 million impost on the coal sector. And not a single competitor abroad pays that tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the carbon tax is still crippling the economy astounds me. Does the Labor Party want to stifle Australia from keeping its AAA credit rating and stop Australia succeeding in the global marketplace? The coalition government has introduced legislation to repeal the crippling carbon tax and the massive mining tax. The carbon tax is stifling Australia's economy, and we have been charged with the job of getting Australia's economy moving and improving. The Labor Party needs to get on board and repeal the crippling carbon tax and the mammoth mining tax to reduce the cost pressures on mining and mining related businesses. These businesses can expect costs to fall by around $87.6 million per annum as a consequence of just repealing the carbon tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The carbon tax removal legislation has already passed this House. There is only one person standing in the way of getting it through the Senate, and that is the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten. He and his Labor senators have refused to listen to what the Australian public have said. So Bill Shorten needs to make a decision: does he stand up for those jobs in the mining industry or the interests of the green movement? Repealing these taxes will boost business confidence and assist in growing the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that mining is important to the Hunter. To demonstrate the effect of the mining industry in my area, I would like to call upon a report from Deloitte Access Economics, <span style="font-style:italic;">Prospects and challenges for the Hunter region</span>. This study found that 40 per cent of the state's coal resources are located in the Hunter Valley. It also found that the mining industry accounts for almost a quarter of the Hunter's economy. That makes it the major direct employer, with the industry employing around 17,700 full-time workers. This figure represents about 7.2 per cent of the regional workforce. The report predicts that the Hunter's mining sector is expected to expand over the next 20 years or so, with additional coal production and the emerging coal seam gas sector. The mining sector is projected to contribute 24.2 per cent of the total regional output in 2036, representing an increase of almost two per cent from 2012. With that expected increase in coal and coal seam gas production, we need to stop red tape getting in the way of future Hunter mine owners finding the product. We need to cut the red tape getting in the way of opportunity and increasing Australia's economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nondirect mining industries of construction, transport and wholesale trade that contribute to the Hunter coal supply network rely on this industry continuing its success. The workers in these mining related industries constitute around 15 per cent of the economy, and employ around 37,400 full-time workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To bring it home, recent job cuts in the mining sector have seen unemployment creep up to 5.5 per cent. The mining downturn in the Hunter and the recent closes of Glencore and Integra coal mines have had an impact. In the Hunter we have witnessed the recent job cuts in the mining sector. In March Australian coal mines succumbed to the cuts pressures in the industry, with mining giant, Glencore Xstrata, announcing the closure of Ravensworth Underground Mine in the Hunter Valley. With thermal coal prices slumping close to a four-year low, the Hunter Valley mine was no longer profitable and will be closed by September. This closure will affect around 130 workers at the mine and it follows several other coalmine closures and deferrals of new coalmines over the past two years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Glencore Xstrata statement blamed the closure on low coal prices, high mining costs, the higher Australian dollar and geographical constraints. The closure has been coming for some time, as the mine had previously shed 35 workers late last year. And the carbon tax and the mining tax are all cost imposts on the mining industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Glencore Xstrata is the world's biggest exporter of thermal coal. It has already reduced its Australian workforce by more than 10 per cent over the past 18 months in a bid to improve its productivity and its profits. Then, just last month we learned that Integra is to slash 500 jobs from the Glennies Creek underground mine and the Camberwell open-cut mine near Singleton in the Hunter Valley—again, blaming coal prices. Integra told employees that although operations would be shut down, facilities would be maintained. It has also blamed poor coal prices for its decision. However, the good news is that the mine will still be maintained and only closed until profitable again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coal prices have dropped more than 30 per cent over the past two years, forcing many companies to reassess their operations to ensure that they are economically viable. The company had been planning to start a new longwall operation at the Glennies Creek mine, but that project is now uncertain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is over 600 workers in the Hunter alone. We need to help the industry to become profitable again. We need to cut the red tape and repeal the mining and carbon taxes so that we can be competitive in the global marketplace and increase employment in the area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mining downturn affects other industries, all the way through hospitality, manufacturing and even medical. The effects of the mining downturn do not stop at the mine workers. The effects flow down through the nonmining related businesses that supply the mines, their workers and their families. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Newcastle Herald's</span> Ian Kirkwood recently profiled three Singleton businesses. Mr Kirkwood profiled Singleton contract company, Pit Patrol, Hunter Valley Glass and Windscreens and the Coal Rock Coffee and Cafe. Pit Patrol's general manager, Aaron Goadsby, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Pit Patrol began in 1993 with a single utility servicing the Camberwell mine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Now, the company did courier work for most of the region's mines, and had two dozen utes and a dozen trucks, with subcontractors' vehicles taking the fleet to 50.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Like a huge range of Singleton and Muswellbrook businesses, Pit Patrol is feeling the pinch from the mining downturn.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to WesTrac and their factory partial closure. WesTrac make mining equipment, and they laid off workers from my electorate in Paterson. This was despite receiving a federal grant of $6 million for the facility at Tomago. The 630 job cuts announced by Caterpillar Earthmoving Equipment agent, WesTrac, last year made my electorate of Paterson an indirect victim of the slump in the coalmining industry. Many of my constituents made up the workforce at the new Tomago headquarters. The Tomago workers were the hardest hit, with an estimated 210 jobs going from the firm's Hunter workforce of around 700.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This employer was one of the mining related businesses in the Hunter region which was reacting to the end of the investment phase of the mining boom. Unfortunately, it will not be the last. This particular business's job cuts came as a surprise to my electorate, following a significant investment by the federal government into that business back in 2007. But that is the impact that the coalmining industry has had on the community in the Hunter as a whole.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also further added to the issues of youth unemployment in Paterson, as half of the job losses were apprentices. These young men and women began their apprenticeships in the belief that they were pursuing a steady, lucrative and responsible career path. The youth unemployment figure in my electorate of Paterson is nothing to celebrate. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that the unemployment of 15- to 24-year-olds sits at around 7.1 per cent, and if the industry stays in this state of downturn it is a figure that will only increase.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no silver bullet to fix this problem, and we need to save them from a life on welfare dependency and get them into our workforce. We can do this by cutting the red tape and allowing new employers to enter into the area, and by allowing the spirit of opportunity to take hold. As I have said before, I believe that anyone can succeed with opportunity, enterprise and ambition. The question I ask is: why are we still stifling entrepreneurial Australians from achieving their maximum potential? The answer is: Bill Shorten.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former Labor government left us with a big financial debt—a massive debt. And we are charged with the responsibility of cleaning it up. They recklessly overspent and underplanned. It is we, the coalition, that have brought responsibility back to spending. It is we, the coalition, that have begun cutting bureaucratic red tape. It is we, the coalition, that are trying repeal the crippling carbon tax and the monstrous mining tax. It is we, the coalition, that are standing up for sustainability and for Australian jobs.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="250077" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VARVARIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2014 Measures No. 3) bill 2014. The changes to immediate deductibility that the bill seeks to enact were committed to by the Gillard government in March last year and legislated by the coalition this month as part of a package of bills to restore simplicity, fairness and integrity to the Australian tax system. This bill seeks to better target tax deduction on expenditure granted to the taxpayer to 'genuine exploration activity' in the procurement of mining exploration rights and information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to give my fellow members background to the concerns which gave rise to the bill, I quote from a statement by the Gillard government Treasury on the 14th of May 2013:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Some taxpayers are claiming an immediate deduction for mining rights and information purchased at a late stage, after natural resources have effectively been discovered. If the purchaser then undertakes some limited additional 'confirmatory' activity, they can claim an immediate deduction for the full purchase price. This means that the immediate deduction is effectively claimed for the value of natural resources that have already been discovered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gillard government announced in mid-2013 that it would legislate to revoke immediate deductibility for assets first used in mining exploration, with the exception of mining rights acquired from the government and farm-out arrangements. In recent years, concerns have arisen that immediate deductibility was being taken advantage of in cases where no 'genuine exploration' is intended, such as the case in which a taxpayer is already aware that a commercial opportunity exists in the area targeted for exploration. The imaginary scenario provided in the previous government's proposal paper outlined a situation in which initial mining rights by Explorer Coalition. are met with an immediate $10-million deduction after Explorer Coalition. carries out significant exploratory work on a site at considerable cost. However, Explorer Coalition goes on to sell mining rights to the same site to Miner Coalition. for $300 million. Now, Miner Co. may carry out some minor 'confirmatory' exploration work in relation to the same site, which had already been subject to exploration by Explorer Coalition, but is essentially already aware that the site contains the resources which are being sought for commercial exploitation. But Miner Coalition goes on to claim an immediate deduction of $300 million for the cost of acquiring the mining rights, despite carrying out only cursory 'confirmatory' exploration work. This scenario is the essence of the integrity and tax erosion concern that the government has and provides a clear example of the way in which industry practice is going beyond the original policy intent of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To summarise the purpose of this bill, I quote from the explanatory memorandum:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill is an integrity measure which is designed to ensure that the immediate deduction for rights and information fulfils its original purpose of encouraging genuine exploration. There was evidence that the immediate deduction was being used to obtain a deduction for the value of resources already discovered rather than for the right to search for yet to be discovered resources. This is outside the policy intent of supporting genuine exploration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, these changes were announced by the previous government with the aim of protecting the tax base from erosion and restoring integrity in taxpayers' deductibility claims for the purchase of mining rights and information from another taxpayer. This is an intention to guide tax policy which the coalition fully supports and is now implementing. Once the legislation is in effect, expenditure on assets used in exploration by taxpayers will depreciate over the life of the asset or over fifteen years, whichever comes first. The initial acquisition of mining rights and information from government issuing authorities will not be affected by the changes, as it is industry practice in acquiring exploration rights from other taxpayers that is presenting an integrity concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The components of the bill also still provide immediate deductibility to expenditure incurred following the generation of new mining information or the acquisition of geophysical or geological information data packages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, co-exploration agreements or farm-in farm-out arrangements, which often involve small explorers, will not be affected. These arrangements grant third-party access to a mineral interest for the purposes of testing, drilling or exploration. It is also important that the government will continue to provide immediate deductibility for the costs incurred by a taxpayer themselves in generating new information or improving existing information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these exceptions demonstrate that the bill does not seek to merely protect the tax base or save money by removing concession measures. Rather, it seeks to provide tax concessions for genuine exploration activity. There are a number of benefits to the mining sector, the government, and the Australian people which we will gain as a result of passing this legislation. Firstly, projected revenue in excess of $1 billion over the forward estimates will be credited to the government from reduced or targeted tax concession to the acquisition of mining rights and information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, this is an integrity measure and, as such, an essential in protecting the tax base from erosion by overuse and misuse of tax concessions. Just as one duty of government is to provide tax concessions to activities and initiatives which benefit the Australian community or take the strain off the public sector, it is an inherent obligation of government to protect the tax base from misuse and to preserve concessional tax measures for the purpose for which they were originally intended. It is only by preserving the tax base that the government can continue to incentivise those activities which provide significant spillover benefits to the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, by limiting tax concessions to genuine instances of exploration, the government will provide incentive measures for genuine exploration while resolving significant integrity concerns. By changing concessions to the mining sector from immediate deductibility to depreciation over the shorter of fifteen years or the life of the asset, this bill ensures that while concessions remain they will be better targeted to the original intent of the concessional measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also ratifies the original policy intent of the measures, which should always be in mind when governments amend legislation, and ensures that tax concessions are only granted for activities which legitimately benefit the Australian community and economy, not exploration rights sought for the purposes of deductibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, the bill restores and maintains the integrity of the tax system and mining sector interaction with the system. In legislating in this area, the government is remembering how important it is to continually re-evaluate how taxpaying bodies interact with tax concession schemes to better target those activities which have spillover economic benefits for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A further benefit which was at the forefront of the government's mind when introducing this suite of legislation was certainty. When business is met with instability and hesitation in projected legislation, it is afflicted with operational uncertainty. This was the case in this area of legislation. When the coalition assumed government last year, we found that as many as 96 measures in the area of taxation and superannuation reform had been announced or proposed and then never legislated. Some of these announcements dated as far back as March 2001; a case of governmental procrastination which had become unacceptable, given the impact that such announcements have on the business community and the decisions it makes about how it is to operate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Operational uncertainty is one of many consequences of unstable and irresponsible government which paralyses the market. By finally legislating in this area and providing business with certainty as to government policy, the coalition is providing certainty to businesses and consumers, boosting consumer confidence in a new way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak briefly about the coalition's appreciation for the mining sector. The government supports the mining sector because the government wants to see a strong Australia and a strong economy which produces jobs for Australian workers. Indeed, the mining sector has provided Australia with one of the most significant areas of economic and jobs growth that we have seen over the past twenty years. Our minerals and resources sector has been the great wave of growth that our country has ridden into the 21st century. It is a cause of great national pride, and government should not seek to hinder or clamp down on the productivity of the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the government's strong support for the mining and exploration sector does not mean the government will sit back and relax about tax-base erosion or integrity concerns. It is because we support mining activity to such an extent that we have to safeguard the sustainability of the sorts of tax concessions we provide the sector. If we continue to see the sort of tax-base erosion that has been produced by the increasing number of deductibility claims in this area, the government will be unable to deliver on its intention to provide tax concessions. Put simply, threats to Australia's tax base are ultimately a threat to Australia's sovereignty. Our aim entering the election period was to restore integrity and fairness to the Australian taxation system, and this bill is one measure which goes towards fulfilling this aim. Furthermore, we are resolving the legislative backlog which resulted from years of governmental procrastination and stagnation. Such backlogs produce operational uncertainty in business, in this case within the mining sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ensuring the compatibility of the Australian tax system with a productive private sector, especially in the case of Australia's signature resource sector, has always been a priority of the coalition. However, it must be fair and simple, and any amendments must be delivered with legislation so that we do not cause unrest or uncertainty for business. This commitment is in line with our pledge to provide stable and predictable government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Restoring integrity to our tax system and resolving the legislation backlog left by our predecessors is an ongoing task. However, the progress on these goals accomplished by this legislation is significant, and this is a bill worthy of your support. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:19</span>):  I would like to start by thanking all those that have contributed to this debate—in particular, those on the coalition side who made a contribution that I thought was appropriate; they recognised the bill that is before the House. It stands in stark contrast unfortunately to the pious amendment that has been moved by the shadow minister at the table. I have to say that is entirely consistent with Labor's failure to recognise the results of the last federal election and entirely consistent with Labor's ongoing commitment to their mining tax. The amendment moved by the shadow assistant Treasurer once again attempts to portray Labor's failed mining tax as in some way being a fairness tax or a benefit to Australia and to her people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One wonders how long Labor will keep up the charade of being supportive of a mining tax that has some $16 billion or so of expenditure associated with it, but in reality—as we saw in yesterday's question time answer from the Treasurer—placed Labor on a platform where it missed the projection by some 97 per cent. I think the Treasurer described it as a 'once-in-100-year event'. But the most telling aspect of it is that the Australian Labor Party—still, on a bill like this—attempts to make mischief and attempts to hold out that the mining tax is in some way in the interests of the Australian people. The amendment that was moved underscores yet again how completely out of touch the Labor Party is. Frankly, it baffles me how a former government, a now opposition, could continue to pretend that this tax—which has failed to make 97 per cent of its forecast revenue, and is being thrust once again before the House as part of the national debate about the future of our country—is in any way, shape or form a positive step.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have thought that any sane person, having put forward a policy initiative and having seen that policy initiative raise three per cent, approximately, of its forecast revenue—a policy initiative that is responsible in part for some of the significant tens of billions of dollars of debt this country faces—would run a mile from it. But, instead, the Australian Labor Party actually puts it up as a pious amendment to the bill that is before the House as some kind of pathetic, desperate grasp to say, 'Don't worry about the actual results; let's just keep all the discussion about principle. Don't worry about the fact that the execution of policy by the former Labor government yielded a spectacular failure. Don't worry about facts like that; let's just talk about why we believe as a matter of principle this should be done.'</span>

                    </a>  The good news is that the member for Perth, according to media reports, said, 'We've got to get rid of this damn tax.' That was reported as her comments to caucus yesterday. This is the 'damn tax'—to use her words—that the former Treasurer referred to as 'an historic reform'. This is the damn tax about which the former Treasurer, the member for Lilley, said, 'The mining tax linked investments cannot be made without mining tax revenue'—this is the $16 billion of associated expenditure—which, by this very amendment, the Labor Party is attempting to drag back onto the floor of the chamber and to defend as being in some way a step in the right direction, as being in some way a policy initiative that ought to be supported, and highlighting, again, that apparently that Labor's failed mining tax supports 'the benefits of a strong mining sector, and supports a fair taxation system'.</span>

On each of those fronts, let me make it clear that the coalition does not support the amendment that was moved by the Australian Labor Party. We do not support it and we do not support Labor's failed approach.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically, this bill—that is, not the amendment; the bill that was moved by the government—is an integrity measure that is designed to prevent the immediate deduction for mining, quarrying and prospecting rights first used for exploration being used outside its intended purpose. The measure is necessary to ensure the sustainability of this concession over the long term. The cost of mining, quarrying and prospecting rights first used for exploration will be deductible over the shorter of 15 years or the effective life of the right or information.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is continuing to work with industry to address concerns around permits acquired through farm-out arrangements and interest realignments, which will remain immediately deductible. This will protect the acquisition of rights and information for genuine exploration by ensuring its tax treatment supports the acquisition of unexplored tenements. We do not support the amendment. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  There are some occurrences so bleak and sad that just to know them seems to deaden and freeze a part of you. To think that teenage girls in India, two cousins, needing to go to the toilet, went into a field at dusk in Uttar Pradesh, where they had grown up, and simply because they were girls and because they were born to a particular caste, were pack raped and hanged from a tree. It is a horrible thing to even know. Imagine what it was to be those girls. Imagine what it is to be their families. And imagine what girls in Uttar Pradesh think now when they go by themselves to a toilet in the field or see a shadow that might be something hanging from a tree.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gender discrimination and violence happen every day, in every country, and we each have an obligation to make sure we continue to act and speak against it. In many countries, including India, the absence of clean water and toilets puts girls and women at greater risk of being attacked. This risk is compounded in poor areas where a lack of education, corrupt police and caste discrimination are prevalent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These girls belonged to the Dalit or 'untouchable' caste, yet—as has been sadly observed of the caste system—untouchability for women is always a curse but never a protection. Let us remember that some 2.5 billion people around the world, 36 per cent of the global population, do not have adequate sanitation facilities. Let us remember that Australian aid makes a significant and lasting contribution to addressing that problem, and to reducing gender discrimination and violence in developing countries.</span>

This program is very important to people in my electorate. We had a tragic accident on 18 February 2006 when a driver hit and killed six children. We saw the strong contribution of a chaplain at the Mildura secondary college as he helped to support children struggling with the tragedy. The chaplaincy in schools program will deliver $20,000 per year for up to 2,900 schools right across Australia and also $24,000 per year for remote schools. The advantage of helping young students as they grow and struggle to find their place in life and have someone to talk to is very valuable. This program has delivered really great things over the years. It has been supported by both sides of the House and it is really pleasing to see money dedicated to it in this budget. We believe our young people have a future. We believe our schools are very supportive. We also believe that a chaplain's role in school is instrumental in helping young adults become fulfilled, confident and great individuals.</span>

Leanne is a wheelchair basketball champion, who is now setting her sights on riding her modified two-wheel bike over the steep hills of Thailand to raise money for charity. Leanne, who won a silver medal at the London Paralympics, will ride 600 kilometres across Thailand's unforgiving roads to raise money to purchase wheelchairs for young people with disability. The ride is not only a testament to Leanne's courage and determination; it is also an example of the ability of people with disability and the social connectedness associated with sport and recreation. Last year Leanne also completed the CyclePower Fiji, an annual ride organised by Victorian not-for-profit organisation Disability Sport and Recreation to raise awareness about the sporting abilities of people with disability.</span>

Leanne and fellow CyclePower Thailand riders will visit Phuket Special School to encourage sporting activities among the 300 students with special needs, using sports equipment donated by Disability Sport and Recreation. I wish Leanne and everyone else— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  I was honoured recently to address an assembly of secondary school children and teachers at the Australian Defence Force 2015 gap year launch hosted by Mitchelton State High School. With a 'try before you buy' mantra in mind, the Assistant Minister for Defence, Stuart Robert, offered student attendees at the launch the chance to view and interact with army equipment, including helicopters and our famous Bushmasters. Students also had the opportunity to meet serving defence personnel from the Gallipoli Barracks in my electorate, who were happy to share their stories and experiences.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ADF Gap Year Program attracts government funding to the sum of $191.8 million dollars over the course of four years, allowing young Australian school leavers to experience military training and lifestyle whilst gaining new skills and pay over their gap year. The life skills and job training acquired during the gap year experience are invaluable to students regardless of the career they ultimately undertake. Completion of the program will, however, offer participants the chance to continue in the services or transfer their knowledge to the ADF Reserves.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am delighted that the government has chosen to re-establish this initiative and believe it will help to deliver on the coalition's promise of stronger defence for Australia. If the enthusiasm of the students is anything to go by, I am looking forward to a strong uptake from the Ryan electorate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  Members opposite sometimes appear to think that you can cut the Public Service with no loss to the quality of services delivered by that Public Service. During the last parliament, I heard members opposite describe public servants as those who 'feed on others' and I heard the member for North Sydney, Joe Hockey, joking about the fact that his Public Service cuts would drive down house prices in Canberra by driving up unemployment. Another pernicious effect of the coalition breaking its promise not to cut more than 12,000 jobs and then cutting 16,500 jobs is the impact it will have on law and order. There has never been a better time for tax dodgers and white-collar criminals as the Abbott government slashes staff at the Australian Taxation Office and cuts resources at the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. As ASIC chairman, Greg Metcalf has noted, 'What it means is that we do not have the luxury of doing as much proactive surveillance.' ASIC's budget will be cut by $120 million and the ATO's budget will be cut by $142 million. Around 3,000 jobs will be lost by the Australian Taxation Office. Those opposite talk about the rule of law but these cuts to ASIC and to the ATO will lead to the law of the jungle. If those opposite were faced with a government that was taking police off the streets, they would say it would increase crime. But they are taking away those who enforce our tax laws and our corporations law. As a result, Australian corporate crime and tax avoidance may well rise. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  I am delighted to inform the House that residents of north-eastern Tasmania will have a permanent memorial in place for next year's centenary of Anzac Day, remembering the 457 veterans from their region who served in the Great War. The Scottsdale RSL Sub-Branch, in my electorate of Bass, has successfully applied for a grant of $25,000 under the government's Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. What they are coming up with is a walk of honour at the Scottsdale cenotaph which will feature paving stones engraved with the name, rank and service number of World War I veterans who were born in the Dorset municipality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The official records show that in Scottsdale alone, which had a population of just 1,653 souls in 1914, 139 people volunteered for war service and 29 gave their lives. I know their contribution was replicated in many towns and farming and mining hamlets in north-eastern Tasmania. The walk of honour will help current and future generations understand what residents of the Scottsdale area sacrificed in the Great War. I visited the site of the project recently and am confident it will be a fitting commemoration of the Anzac spirit in north-eastern Tasmania. The project has been three years in the making, and it is only proper that we acknowledge the work of the Scottsdale RSL President, my friend, Bruce Scott; Treasurer, Brian Medcraft; and Scottsdale RSL members for their passion for and commitment to this important project.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  Yesterday the ACT government handed down its 2014-15 budget, and, let me tell you, the Gallagher government could teach the Abbott government a thing or two about delivering budgets in tough times without breaking promises or hurting low- and middle-income families. The ACT budget is a sensible mix of investment in health, education, infrastructure and community services, and carefully targeted revenue measures. It is a budget that will grow the ACT's economy, that will do its best to shield the ACT from the significant economic challenge presented by the Abbott government's cuts. As the ACT's Treasurer, Andrew Barr, said in his budget speech, all budgets are about choices. Where the Abbott government has chosen to break promises, to cut and to target the most vulnerable in our community, the ACT government has chosen to support fairness and opportunity, to invest in our city, and to believe in the brilliant possibilities of Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />There is no question that the Abbott government's budget has called on Canberra to do the heavy lifting. The promise of cutting at least 16,500 Public Service jobs over the next four years means around 6,500 will be lost from right here in Canberra. That is around 2.9 per cent of the ACT's total workforce—and I fear that that is just the start. Reduced spending from the Commonwealth will impact Canberra's wider labour market by influencing hiring decisions and delaying recruitment plans in the private sector. Canberra faces an enormous economic challenge, and I commend the Gallagher government for not adding to the pain caused by the Abbott government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Allen Bolaffi went into hospital on Sunday morning at 8 am suffering from a suspected infection after returning from an overseas trip. At the age of 57, he was dead by the end of the day. It is an extraordinary story in the modern environment, with all the things we know about health and research, that a person of 57 could die so quickly from the septic shock that set in from this infection.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Allen Bolaffi was a great stalwart of the Adelaide business community, but particularly the Jewish community. He was the founder and 20-year chairman of the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce in South Australia. To put that in some perspective, I first spoke at the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce in 1994, and 14 people were present. Following a budget during the Howard-Costello government, the South Australian chapter of the AICC organised a post-budget lunch for Peter Costello—and 1,200 people attended. Allen Bolaffi made an enormous difference to South Australia, to the Jewish community in South Australia, as chairman of the Adelaide Jewish Museum and to his synagogue, and he will be greatly missed by the people of South Australia, people of my electorate. As a personal friend of mine, I will miss him very greatly.</span>

This report, using census data, identified the alarming situation where 2,680 students—that is, six per cent—across six LGAs, including my electorate, are not attending school. Educators worked tirelessly to follow up on absences and adopt processes to ease the transition for students moving from primary to secondary school. Many schools employ attendance officers and welfare officers to provide the much-needed support to students and families to keep students engaged at school. Whilst national partnerships money has supported this work in recent years and allowed success stories of re-engagement, transition and improved attendance for at-risk students, federal cuts to this funding will impact negatively. There has been a failure to understand that schools receive no specific funding for this critical work. Without funding, more vulnerable young children aged 10 to 14 will drop out of the system.</span>

Whilst the result of the game was fairly ordinary for North Queensland supporters, the company was fantastic. Joining the Cowboys, Senator Brett Mason and me were the High Commissioners from Fiji and Papua New Guinea. If we are to develop the north of Australia, we must look not just inwardly. We must not just look west of Townsville; we must look east and north. Fiji and Papua New Guinea will be very important countries, as will all the Melanesian nations, in the development of northern Australian and the development of my city.</span>

I was lucky enough to score the chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Thailand. Last night we had a gathering of a lot of people, and I got to meet His Excellency Mr Maris Sangiampongsa, who is the Ambassador of Thailand to Australia, Tonga, Fiji and Papua New Guinea. There are 65 million people in Thailand and 290 Thai people in Townsville. We are looking forward to seeing him there.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Last week I spoke in the parliament about and for the Bangladeshi workers who lost their lives in the Rana Plaza disaster in an entirely preventable industrial accident and in recognition and support of their struggle for justice. But I am also not forgetting textile, clothing and footwear workers in Australia. The industry has been critical in Melbourne's north, in the past especially and still today, where hundreds of people in the Scullin electorate are employed in the industry. There are also many outworkers in Melbourne's north, including in the Scullin electorate, who work in conditions that should prick all of our consciences, just like those terrible conditions in Bangladesh do. I was horrified at some photos of outworker workplaces shown to me by Michele O'Neil, the wonderful and inspiring National Secretary of the Textile Clothing &amp; Footwear Union of Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was shocked at the retrograde steps that this government is taking in respect of this industry and those who work in it in terms of the termination of Commonwealth funding to Ethical Clothing Australia and the winding back of hard-won protections in the Fair Work Amendment (Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industry) Act 2012—two attacks on exploited outworkers there. And there are three further measures: the revocation of the Fair Work priorities from 1 July this year, the closure of two important business support funds and the early termination of structural adjustment programs and vital access and advocacy support for retrenched workers. This government is abandoning the textile industry and, shamefully, it is abandoning vulnerable and exploited workers in that industry. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  With winter approaching, the temperatures plummeting and thousands of Australians having their electricity cut off because of high electricity prices, I would like to raise something that recently happened to a family in Liverpool. Because they could not afford their electricity bills, they got a small bit of coal to try and warm their house to keep their three kids warm. Unfortunately, they did not open a window to allow for some ventilation, and those children had to go to hospital for carbon monoxide poisoning. This is one of the costs of high electricity prices in our country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />We know that the lowest 20 per cent of income earners in this country pay 3½ times as much, as a percentage of their income, for electricity as the average family does, and they pay five times as much as the 20 per cent on high incomes. That is why I call on good members of the opposition to please repeal the carbon tax before winter starts. We know that the cost is $550 for the average family. It is a regressive tax. It hits the poorest in this country the hardest. So I call on you to show good conscience, talk to your friends over there in the Senate and repeal this regressive tax at least for when winter starts so families in this country can afford their electricity bills. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I was very pleased to join with the community for what was a very exciting and informative event. The open-day celebrations really showcased the array of services that the clinic offers. A year in, the Tweed Health for Everyone Superclinic has expanded so much, and in fact it is an absolutely huge community success.</span>

In fact, in the past year, they have treated 50,000 patients, a great achievement for this superclinic. I would particularly like to acknowledge the work of the clinic's main doctors, Dr Di Blankensee, Dr Austin Sterne and Dr Jenni Soden, and also all their staff on this first birthday celebration.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the local federal Labor member, I was very proud to have delivered the $7 million needed to provide this wonderful medical facility and all the services it brings with it. In fact, prior to the 2010 election, I had announced that, if Labor were re-elected, we would be delivering this superclinic, and indeed we did. It has now been open for a year, and it is fantastic. That is what Labor governments do: we provide health services like this outstanding clinic.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  I rise to draw the House's attention to the incredible story of the Carrolup artworks and the young Nyungar artists who grew up near my home town of Katanning. In 1945, the new headmaster of the Carrolup Native Settlement School, Mr Noel White, recognised the natural talent the Nyungar schoolchildren had for drawing. He secured crayons, pencils and paper and encouraged them to bushwalk and draw whatever they saw. They created vivid landscapes, rich with wildlife, and depictions of traditional Aboriginal life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1966, US businessman Herbert Mayer purchased these paintings, and the art was lost for many years. But, in 2004, a touring Australian-based art scholar visiting Colgate University, in upstate New York, recognised the works as those of the Nyungar children of Carrolup. This prompted 10 years of cultural interchange between the Nyungar elders of the Great Southern, academics and students of Colgate, culminating in the generous donation of these artworks to Curtin University, in Western Australia.</span>

I hope this exhibition of unique artworks proves inspirational to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Western Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  I rise today to congratulate the team of scientists at the Newcastle CSIRO Energy Centre who this week announced a globally significant breakthrough in solar energy generation. Project lead Robbie McNaughton and his team have, for the first time, used solar energy to generate the hottest supercritical steam ever achieved outside of fossil fuel sources. This breakthrough has been described as the equivalent of breaking the sound barrier and confirms the potential of solar energy to be used to drive power station turbines now fuelled by coal or gas. This advance is a game changer in energy generation and demonstrates the potential for power plants of the future to use the free, zero-emission energy of the sun to achieve the same result as fossil fuels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The $5.68 million research program has been supported by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA. This development is a clear reminder of the expertise of Australian scientists and the potential for Australia to be a leader in renewable energy. Under this science-denying government, who have elected to scrap ARENA and hundreds of jobs at the CSIRO, the potential for future breakthroughs such as this look much less likely. I call on the Abbott Liberal government to start making some smart decisions for our planet's future. Appointing a science minister to guide our research, keeping university affordable for scientists, supporting renewables and getting a real plan for climate change would be a good start.</span>

The reason that visit was to formally announce the funding of $100,000 of security improvements to the perimeter of the Belmont Forum and village shopping centre complex. In attendance were the Minister for Justice, the Hon. Michael Keenan; Glenys Godfrey, the hardworking local MLA for Belmont; the Mayor, Phil Marks, and the CEO, Stuart Cole, of the City Belmont; Mario Fisicchia, of the Sapore Espresso Bar, where there had been an attempted break-in earlier that week; and John Gillespie, also known as Jock, the CEO of the PCYC.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">CCTV has been successful in Belmont, and the Liberal Party has a long record of commitment to crime prevention in the area. The rollout of CCTV in Kewdale and Rivervale was spurred on by a commitment by the Howard government back in 2007 and has been considered a success. The City of Belmont supported this commitment because of the stats suggesting that CCTV actually works. In Belmont between January and August 2013 some 48 incidents involving closed circuit television were given to the police, with 20 positive results.</span>

With a lot of pressure we managed to get them to open it five times!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apparently the wellbeing of regional Australians would be at the forefront of a Liberal-National Party government in health policy. However, in Senate estimates last week the minister for rural and regional health admitted that she was not involved in any discussions about the implementation of the new GP tax, nor was she privy to any discussions or advice on the impact that this tax would have on regional Australia, nor did the minister make any inquiries about its impact on regional Australia. Before the election the LNP were hopping from country town to country town, telling them that health would be the No. 1 priority. Now Minister Nash has admitted that she was not involved in any way in the No. 1 health priority decision of this newly elected government.</span>

This will help to provide telehealth, remote health clinics and 24-hour coverage for emergency aeromedical evacuations. Over the past year in South Australia and Central Australia the RFDS teams have conducted almost 9,000 aeromedical evacuations. They have conducted over 6,000 telehealth consultations using today's modern technology. At a national level they have done likewise, with thousands and thousands of face-to-face consultations and telehealth consultations. With a fleet of 63 aircraft, they are conducting more than 290,000 patient contacts every year—that is someone, somewhere in our country every two minutes—a fantastic achievement.</span>

On Saturday night I attended one of their great fundraising events, with over 900 people raising close to $200,000. Congratulations to John Lynch and the rest of the team at the RFDS.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  I rise to show my support for the Vic ambos' Code Red campaign. Victorian ambos are the highest trained in the country and have the best cardiac survival rates in the country, yet they are the lowest paid. That is why half the Victorian paramedics are considering leaving the state of Victoria to practise their skills in other states. The Victorian Liberal government pays paramedics at least 30 per cent less than those in other states. That is why Victorian paramedics are finding it very hard to support their families and an exodus is occurring. Today in Bendigo there was a rally of about 100 paramedics and their supporters, asking Denis Napthine, the Victorian Premier, to meet them. He refused. Perhaps this is why he is about to become the former Premier of Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These ambos are working really hard and they deserve our support. The federal government is also attacking them. They are concerned that the GP tax will make their job harder, with people not seeking help when they need it but waiting until a crisis or an emergency and then calling out an ambo. The ambos are also under attack from this government because of their HECS debt. They will have to pay more on their HECS debts. Again, whether it be state, whether it be federal, the Liberals just do not care about our paramedics in Bendigo and Victoria.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  Last Saturday morning I had the good fortune to attend a sad but very successful fundraising event at Perth in the north of my electorate of Lyons. The publican at the Queens Head Inn at Perth, Les Oakley, organised this very special version of Australia's biggest morning tea cancer fundraiser. This very special event was organised in memory of Mrs Pauline Davey, who has coordinated the town's annual morning teas with her friend Janice Burn for the past seven years. Sadly, Mrs Davey, who was a cancer sufferer herself, died earlier this year, so Mr Oakley volunteered to help keep the event going as a tribute to the well-known and dedicated community worker.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mrs Davey's husband, Tony, advised me that more than 180 people turned up to the morning tea this year, I have no doubt many to remember the contributions made by Pauline over many years. They raised more than $2,700, which will go to the Cancer Council of Tasmania. Mr Oakley prepared most of the food, including home-made sausage rolls and soup. Former Perth IGA supermarket proprietor Dennis Woods organised all the bread and fillings and Margaret Double made the sandwiches. Yvonne Morton made scones, as she always does.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">14:00</span>):  I wish to make two statements prior to beginning question time. One is a ruling with regard to standing order 68. I hope the House might bear with me as it is a fairly lengthy one. However, copies will be made available so that people can see the statement itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At question time on Monday, 2 June, the Manager of Opposition Business raised a point of order about standing order 68.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last paragraph of standing order 68 was an addition made at the commencement of this parliament. It provides:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If a Member has given a personal explanation to correct a misrepresentation and another Member subsequently repeats the matter complained of, the Speaker may intervene.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that the standing order applies to all proceedings in the House and Federation Chamber, not just to question time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the first occasion that an issue under the new standing order 68 has been raised and so there is no existing interpretation of the provision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interpreting standing order 68 presents considerable difficulties for the chair. Importantly, the wording in the standing order that the Speaker may intervene is a clear indication that the additional provision should not result in an automatic estoppel to a member speaking on a particular topic. Nor can it be allowed to be used to disrupt. Accordingly, any general use of the standing order is significantly limited by the following:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the chair would need to be aware that a personal explanation had been made about an issue for which there is a complaint and that it amounted to a correction;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the chair would need to be satisfied that the matter complained of is an exact repetition of the matter responded to by way of personal explanation; and</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the chair would need to determine whether to intervene and if so what is the appropriate intervention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the one hand, the standing order potentially creates a role for the chair to intervene in the free flow of information, discussion and debate in the House even though there are other forms of the House available for recourse. On the other hand, it is recognised that members can take great offence at misrepresentations being repeated when they believe they have corrected a misrepresentation, at times on a number occasions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Achieving a balance between these two objectives is a challenge, particularly as I have said on many occasions that I wish to actively promote free speech and robust debate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The wording of standing order 68, tying the intervention to a correction, creates its own problems. The standing order states 'the Speaker may intervene where a personal explanation has been made "to correct" a misrepresentation'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Oxford Dictionary</span> defines 'to correct' as meaning to set right, amend or substitute right for (wrong). The standing order could be seen to place the chair in the almost impossible position of having to determine whether a personal explanation has in fact amounted to a correction. This could involve the chair, potentially, in a detailed examination of what was said originally and whether it amounted to a misrepresentation or whether a personal explanation had corrected the alleged misrepresentation and whether the subsequent statement is a precise repetition of the said misrepresentation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Notwithstanding these difficulties, I consider the standing order should be interpreted in a manageable way. Thus I propose to adopt the following approach:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">if a member makes a personal explanation to correct a specific personal matter which the member claims is a misrepresentation and another member subsequently repeats the same words that have been the subject of the misrepresentation then: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the member who made the personal explanation can make a complaint to the chair about the misrepresentation being repeated;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the chair in these circumstances may ask the offending member to refrain from repeating the misrepresentation;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">in asking a member to refrain the chair will not be making any judgement on the truth or otherwise of the alleged misrepresentation or the correction;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">should the chair intervene, the member making the complaint will not have the opportunity to subsequently make a personal explanation on the matter; and</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">should the member elect not to seek to invoke standing order 68 and have the chair intervene, a personal explanation would still be available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The difficulties faced by the chair are illustrated by the case raised by the member for Watson in his point of order. The matter commenced on 29 May 2014, when the member for Jagajaga made a personal explanation in response to remarks during question time, which she said were made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health. The remarks appear to be those concerning her involvement in the Hawke government introducing a Medicare co-payment and her position as Director of the National Health Strategy, which advised the then health minister Brian Howe. The member for Jagajaga stated she was opposed to a Medicare co-payment in 1991. In answering a question on 2 June, 2014, the Minister for Health stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Back in the Hawke years, Jenny Macklin, as the head of the policy department that advised Brian Howe at that point, said that a co-payment was necessary to make Medicare sustainable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was at this point that the member for Watson raised his point of order under standing order 68 and said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Minister for Health is now precisely providing information which the member for Jagajaga has previously explained to the House is false.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this case the minister is quite entitled to make reference to earlier history which is on the record. The only occasion for the chair to intervene under standing order 68 is if there is a very specific reference to the matter where the member has corrected the misrepresentation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the minister referred to the member for Jagajaga's role as the head of a policy unit that provided advice to the then government. This is quite legitimate. However, the inclusion of the word 'said', that is, implying the member for Jagajaga stated her support for a co-payment, would seem to invoke the provisions of standing order 68. But if the words were, for instance, that the policy unit headed by Ms Macklin advocated a co-payment, it would seem not to invoke standing order 68.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I trust that members will show a degree of tolerance towards whomever is in the chair as those who occupy the chair endeavour to apply the standing order in a way which is as fair as possible to all members and does not inhibit the free flow of information, discussion and debate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I propose to re-evaluate this approach after a period to assess whether there are any undesirable consequences, particularly on the free flow of debate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">14:07</span>):  There was another question asked of me by the member for Moreton which I also propose to deal with at this stage. I apologise for holding up question time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, after question time, the member for Moreton asked me a question about the use of CCTV and the searching of members' offices within Parliament House. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members have the right to expect that their offices and property are safe from unauthorised access and theft while they are in Parliament House and during their frequent absences from Parliament House. Responsibility for the security of members' suites within Parliament House rests with the Serjeant-at-Arms, and this includes the management of access by third parties to the suites for maintenance (both routine and emergency) and the issue of keys to members' suites.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said yesterday, members' offices cannot be searched without the permission of the relevant member. The only exception to this is in relation to search warrants to be executed by the police in respect of a member.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also asked about the use of CCTV within Parliament House. The first thing to say is that when CCTV was installed in the parliament it was done so to form part of a range of security measures in place to protect Parliament House and, more importantly, its occupants. In respect of access to CCTV footage, I can confirm that such access is governed by a policy which is publicly available on the APH website; however, for the convenience of members I will have copies of the policy delivered to each member's suite today.</span>

                  </a>  No? $8.8 billion I had to put into the Reserve Bank, and why? Because the Labor Party when in government had taken extraordinary dividends and in fact materially weakened the capacity of the Reserve Bank to respond to unforeseen circumstances. So we had to put $8.8 billion into the Reserve Bank. Then buried deep in the Economic Statement of the former Treasurer was a commitment to over 14,000 Public Service redundancies, 14,500 Public Service redundancies that the Labor Party did not have the courage to explain to the Public Service. Did they fund those redundancies? No, they did not. Shock and surprise. And there are other areas. They failed to properly finance the ACCC, they took $1.2 billion from Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory in relation to the so-called Gonski funding. We know it is the old story: the Labor Party wrecks the joint, the coalition has to come in to fix it. That is exactly what has happened. That is one of the reasons why I am absolutely positive our forecasts are more accurate than anything they have ever delivered.</span>

This is a major new step which will help to support states which are looking to recycle some of their assets and to reinvest in new projects which will produce greater productivity and enhance the growth and development of their regions. By using brownfield investments to leverage investment in new areas of infrastructure we will help to provide the infrastructure that we need for the 21st century. It is anticipated that this $5 billion which the Treasurer has put aside into this initiative could lever around $125 billion worth of investment across the nation.

                  </a>  at the choice of the states as they would choose to make these investments. So we believe that this 15 per cent incentive will help make a difference to ensure that projects which may otherwise have been unaffordable can in fact come to fruition. We saw in the Queensland and the ACT budgets over the last couple of days examples of governments wanting to take advantage of this initiative, looking at ways in which they will be able to invest in new greenfield assets that will help build the infrastructure that they need to support their communities. So it is a historic initiative that will certainly expedite nationally significant projects across the country and result in the world-class infrastructure that Australia needs for a prosperous future.</span>

What about the 14,000 redundancies that Labor promised in the Public Service, yet they had not bothered to provide for any redundancy payments? Essentially, this information was withheld in those initial reports. In many other areas as well, Labor had made commitments but had not funded them. Those are the sorts of things we had to take into account when preparing the budget that is before the parliament at the present time. They are the sorts of things which gave the previous government the reputation of having not been honest about its finances and delivering appalling debts. But the true situation was even worse than they had reported to the people.</span>

                  </a>  It is good. And it means that for year on year it is about 3.5 per cent. Household consumption increased by 0.5 per cent in the March quarter to be 2.8 per cent higher over the year. Dwelling investment rose strongly, up 4.7 per cent. And dwelling investment will continue to improve. There is going to be a significant pipeline of construction activity over the next few months which will mean a lot of jobs for plumbers, electricians, builders and brickies. It is a good story. New private investment fell 1.2 per cent, to be four per cent lower for the year. This is essentially the massive investment in the mining construction boom coming off as new investment needs to emerge in the non-mining side of the economy. We are seeing green shoots in this regard. It is hugely important because the non-mining side of the economy is 90 per cent of GDP and 98 per cent of employment in Australia. So we want to see that transition occur. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question will be how quickly mining investment comes off and how quickly new investment in the non-mining side of the economy continues. But, unquestionably—and this is the difference, you have to look through the figures rather than get too excited about the headline—export volumes in the last quarter were exceptional. One of the reasons for that is, thankfully, we did not have any cyclone activity during the March quarter which meant that the miners were able to get the volume out the door, and they dug deep into inventories and that should recover. But the fact is mining volume was exceptional in this quarter. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The net result is that it is the highest percentage increase since September 2000. As a result, we have the smallest current account deficit as a share of GDP since March 1980. I was 14 years of age in 1980 and the member for Longman was 10 years away from being born. So you see, the key is jobs. I remember this Leader of the Opposition standing at the dispatch box railing against the government's activity on jobs. In the first four months of this year, 106,000 new jobs have been created, 79,000 full-time jobs created. So we are on track, let our budget be on track.</span>

Our debt continues to rise, already costing us $1 billion a month in interest, and, if left unchecked, would peak at $667 billion. So we have got a long, hard task ahead of us.

I wish he would not vote against the appropriation bills; I wish he would not do that, notwithstanding the fact that the opposition is obviously not going to block supply, as it is commonly known. And why? Because Australians expect stable government, no matter who it is. They expect stable government. And they expect that the government should be able to engage in appropriations for the best interests of the economy and the best interests of the community. I understand that you are seeking to make a point about the budget, but it is more a political point than a policy point. I wish we would get some constructive policy suggestions from all of those critics, because no-one is offering a credible alternative.</span>

                  </a>  A 'task'! I suggest that is a call to action, in some sort. But there is a budget task. The thing is: the Labor Party is offering no alternative. Indeed, Member for Denison: what is your alternative? What is your alternative to Labor's legacy of $667 billion of debt? What is your alternative to Labor's legacy of deficits as far as the eye can see? What is your alternative to Labor's legacy of unemployment rising to 6¼ per cent—of over 700,000 Australians being unemployed? What are your policy alternatives over there? There are none. And why? Because we have the chief clerk of the national complaints desk here, who is more about complaining than providing an alternative scenario. We know the budget is difficult. We know the budget is tough. The fiscal consolidation is less than budgets we have brought down in previous years, and less than Labor's previous budgets. But the budget is right for Australia and it is right for the Australian economy.</span>

In fact, it is the largest single electorate in the world—probably outside of a totalitarian state, I would suggest! But it is the largest electorate in the world. And of course there is a heavy reliance on everything from road transport to energy in her electorate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The carbon tax is a handbrake on economic growth. There is no doubt about that. And before the election our political opponents recognised that, in a sense, and said that they were going to terminate the carbon tax. The problem is: they are doing everything they can to stop us from terminating the carbon tax. If we repeal the carbon tax, the size of the economy will be about 0.3 per cent higher than it otherwise would have been in 2020. It is actually a tax of $9 billion a year on the economy now, and in four weeks time, unless it is repealed by the Senate in the interim, the legislated carbon tax will go up another five per cent, to $25.40 a tonne. That is three times the size of the European carbon price—three times the size! And the Labor Party are defending that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the carbon tax remains in place, the cost to the economy is enormous. It would cost the Western Australian economy over $200 billion out to 2050 and it would cost the Australian economy over a trillion dollars out to the same point of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it costs families; and if we abolish the carbon tax now we can immediately reduce the cost to the average household by $550 a year—$550 a year! According to Treasury, the expected impact of the tax on real wages rises to about 2.6 per cent by 2030, which is around $2,000 of average full-time wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, if we get rid of the carbon tax we can strengthen the Australian economy. That is the bottom line. That is why we went to the last election saying to the Australian people, 'We want to abolish the carbon tax,' because we want to strengthen the Australian economy, we want to strengthen household budgets and we want to ensure that we can compete on a level playing field with the rest of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only problem is our political opponents, who said before the election that they wanted to terminate the carbon tax. Instead, they come into this place and do everything they can to prevent us from terminating the carbon tax. If the Labor Party does care about the economy, and if it does care about households, support us in getting rid of the carbon tax.</span>

Because I remember the member for Lilley standing at this dispatch box on budget night and announcing that he was going to deliver four surpluses in a row—four surpluses in a row! And the member for Lilley—God bless him! He is my best friend over there; we need more of him—went out last night and said, 'Look, I would have delivered a surplus if only we were re-elected—if only we were re-elected!—Give me another chance,' the member for Lilley said.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:36</span>):  I thank the member for Barker for his question. I can confirm that the Australian government will deliver an affordable, responsible and sustainable aid budget and that while Labor is continuing to make unaffordable, irresponsible and unsustainable commitments, this government will focus on the quality of our investment in developing countries in our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are focusing on results for our aid budget, and we will not be misleading the Australian public into making announcements, as Labor did, of an additional $5.7 billion to the aid budget which they then withdrew from the forward estimates. We will not be ripping $740 million out of the aid budget to plug a hole in the onshore processing costs as a result of their loss of control of the borders, making the Labor Party itself the third largest recipient of Australian foreign aid. Our priorities will include alleviating poverty through economic development, through public-private partnerships leveraging the private sector and through the economic empowerment of women.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are increasing the humanitarian aspects in the budget. In fact, over the weekend I was able to announce an increase of $100 million to the eradicate polio program across our region because we have put sustainability back into the aid budget.</span>

The legacy left by the member for McMahon was 92 announced but unlegislated taxation changes—he did not break the tonne. You think he should be proud of his record. On his website he does not even refer to the fact that he was Treasurer. I would be blanking it out as well. It is the modern equivalent of liquid paper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is, of those 92, including the ones announced by the member for Lilley in last year's budget, Treasury provided advice that they simply could not be legislated. They did not know how to actually draft the legislation because the policy intent came out of the then Treasurer's office without any capacity to actually draft the changes to the taxation laws to get the money that they claimed they were going to get. There were 92 announced but unlegislated taxation changes. In relation to what he claims to be companies moving money offshore, the fact is, again, the advice was that Treasury could not deliver the policy intent because the legislation was going to be drafted with massive unintended consequences for Australian companies that wanted to expand offshore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want Australian companies to expand offshore. We want them to be more profitable and successful in the global market place. It came down to the fact that the Labor Party did not understand taxation policy. That is why they had eight different versions of the mining tax, a mining tax that was just 97 per cent short of original revenue estimations, a mining tax that actually hits a new benchmark in taxation policy—not even the Greeks got there—in announcing a tax that raises no money. But the Labor Party did and that is what we were left with.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The legacy of the pre-election fiscal outlook is there are all these spiders buried in the closets around Canberra. Why? Because Labor did not have any policy; they did not understand how to govern. And that was reflected in the fact that they were constantly changing leaders, they were constantly changing ministers and they were constantly changing policies.</span>

I have not done a study of the frontbench of the government to discover which universities they went to or which ones paid HECS; nor have I done so for the frontbench of the Labor caucus. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I can tell the member that, if she wants to go back and discover who it was that decided that free education was not working—and was not bringing low-SES students into universities but simply subsidising the middle classes and the upper-middle classes—she should look no further than the former Prime Minister and Treasurer Paul Keating. He said at the opening of the Victoria University of Technology, Sunbury campus:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… a 'free' higher education system is one paid for by the taxes of all, the majority of whom haven't had the privilege of a university education. Ask yourself if you think that is a fair thing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member's question gives me the opportunity to point out how far the current modern Labor Party has moved from the Hawke-Keating legacy, and to repeat the point that I made in the previous answer and question: the current Labor Party has shredded their economic credibility. Most Labor figures of the past realised that so-called free education did not have any impact on bringing students into university. </span>

                  </a>  We have a modern-day example that the member for Fraser would have studied. In the United Kingdom there is free education in Scotland and there is a deregulated education market in England. As the member for Fraser knows, since deregulation in England the number of students from low-SES backgrounds is at record levels. The number of students from low-SES backgrounds has ballooned in England; in Scotland there was been no change whatsoever since free education was introduced. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we are absolutely committed to our higher education reforms, because to us it is an equity measure; it is an equity reform. It will give more young people from low-SES backgrounds the opportunity that I had, and that so many members of this House had, to go to university and get the chance to increase their earning capacity over a lifetime. I am not going to slam the door behind me after I got a great university education, and nobody in the Labor Party should either. Get off your Green-Left agenda and start standing up for students from low-SES backgrounds, like I am.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration and Border Protection</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:50</span>):  I thank the member for Hughes, my good friend and colleague from the shire. I also want to thank the Treasurer for his comments regarding our performance in the border protection portfolio. The Treasurer and I have many things in common, and one thing we have in common is backbone. The backbone you have seen displayed on our borders is the same backbone this Treasurer has put into the budget. That is in stark contrast to what we saw from those opposite. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can update the House. It will come as no surprise to the House, I am sure, that since my update yesterday there have still been no successful people-smuggling ventures to Australia, and we are now in our sixth successive month of that being the case. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it was not always thus. I am glad the Treasurer saw fit to reference the performance of the member for Watson and the performance of the member for McMahon—and I could even go to the member for Gorton—when it comes to backbone, or lack thereof, and their performance on the borders. I will remind the House. When the member for Watson was minister for immigration, 68 boats turned up—a total of 5,358 people. And he was only there for a couple of months! When the member for Gorton was minister for immigration, 183 boats turned up—a total of 12,386 people. That is what happened under the member for Gorton.</span>

                  </a>  Madam Speaker, I am reminding the House about the record of the member for McMahon when he was the minister for immigration—398 vessels and 24,447 arrivals. What we will see from the member for McMahon if he were ever to become the Treasurer again is the same backbone that he showed in immigration he would apply to the budget. That is what we are seeing in his response to this budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can update the House that it is true that $2½ billion is the saving in this budget from our successful border protection policies. At the last election, those opposite were forecasting 33,000 arrivals over the budget and forward estimates based on their current policies at the election—enough to fill Simonds Stadium, which is the home stadium of the member for Corio. That would have cost this budget $7 billion. Our border protection policies are working for Australia and the Treasurer's budget is working for Australia—and that is how it will remain.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr TRUSS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:56</span>):  I am happy to answer the question. He asked what the problem is. The problem is Labor. It is Labor that delivered the five biggest deficits ever. It is Labor that has delivered a national debt that will take us generations to repay. And it is Labor that delivered for Queensland an $80 billion debt that Premier Newman and his colleagues have had to try to address. He is doing that through his budget. Through his budget he is trying to restore some balance in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He also inherited a horrible legacy from having followed a Labor government—a Labor government of waste; a Labor government that had actually left schools so dilapidated that many of them had not been painted during the whole time that Labor was in office. Labor had left the people of Queensland an enormous debt, and that is on top of the debt that Queenslanders have to share with other Australians when it comes to our current debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to expenditure on hospitals and on education, let me repeat the self-evident point. Total funding on schools from this government increases by eight per cent this year, eight per cent the following year, eight per cent the year after that and six per cent the following year. When it comes to health, it increases by nine per cent this year, nine per cent the following year, nine per cent the year after that and six per cent the year after that. Total Commonwealth funding to Queensland amounts to $96 billion. Indeed, Queensland will receive $53 billion from GST share, and that is $2.2 billion more than was anticipated in MYEFO. So the Commonwealth is providing significant funds to Queensland and to other states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say by way of observation that, while I quoted nine per cent increases for health and eight per cent increases for education, those are national figures. Queensland figures are actually better than that. They are actually going to get more money than that. So that helps Queensland to try to address the problems Labor left behind—Labor's problems that Premier Newman in his budget has to address and which he is manfully seeking to do. I congratulate him on the work that has been done to rebuild Queensland—a task that we are also setting about nationally.</span>

The government is committed to ensuring the NBN is delivered quickly, cost-effectively, at least cost to taxpayers and affordably for consumers, and we are going about this in a businesslike way. We are conducting now a thorough cost-benefit analysis, being dealt with by an independent panel headed by Dr Mike Vertigan. It will report in the middle of the year and that will inform the rollout of the project. That is in marked distinction to the Labor Party who, as we know, committed to a single access technology—fibre to the premises—without any cost-benefit analysis, all done on the back of a beer coaster on a VIP flight from Sydney to Brisbane.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that a Conrovian fog has fallen over the Labor Party which prevents them from acting in a rational economic manner. It causes them to deny the budget realities, the consequences of their wastefulness, the $667 billion of debt we are headed to without any change. But the fog sometimes breaks. I say with respect to the honourable member that I come not to embarrass the member for Fraser but to praise him, for I am very concerned, as we all are, that the Conrovian nonsense he is forced to spew out occasionally nowadays will live after him, but the wisdom and economic rationality will be buried in his bones, unless we draw people's attention to it. </span>

You can imagine the Conrovian electrodes going onto him, as they give him another jolt to stop him being rational. You can imagine him coming out of the bunker shaking and spouting nonsense about 'no budget crisis and everything is okay'. Imagine the electricity bill of that exercise; imagine the carbon emissions. It is extraordinarily wasteful. But every now and then you see that it is very hard to cause somebody who is highly intelligent to be stupid all of the time. It really is. Even the Labor Party is unable to do that. We know they regret it. They must always be saying, 'If only we'd got him from the AWU, not the ANU!'

I refer the minister to the government's plans to introduce a Medicare co-payment. I ask if the minister could inform the House of the history of support for a co-payment within the parliament and the reasons such a co-payment was advocated.</span>

He has taken quite an interest in the history of the co-payment. For 50 years the  Labor Party has supported a co-payment, right up until this budget.

We want to have a strong Medicare system and that is why we have proposed a co-payment. We know, as I say, that Bob Hawke was the father of the co-payment, we know that Jenny Macklin was the head of the unit that provided advice to Mr Brian Howe, who obviously then went on to implement a co-payment. So we know that Jenny is the mother of the Medicare co-payment and we know that the son of the co-payment is here in the member for Fraser.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As it turns out, when we look at this family tree, there are another couple of people that we need to out today. The member for Lingiari voted for a co-payment in 1991. And we know that the member for Werriwa, the overachiever in the Ferguson family, voted for a co-payment as well. Good on him, because he wanted to make Medicare sustainable. We all want to make Medicare sustainable.</span>

We introduced the co-payment, $5 of which goes into the Medical Research Future Fund, $2 of which goes into doctors' pockets so that we can help supplement the money that they get from Medicare now, so that we keep bulk billing. We cannot afford Labor's model of giving everything to everybody for free and racking it up on the credit card. Bob Hawke knew it. Jenny Macklin knows it. The member for Fraser knows it.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  Madam Speaker, I have a question for you following question time today. I preface it by saying that I understand that it is very difficult to observe everything going on in the chamber during question time, and I appreciate that more than most. But is it appropriate for members of the government to be inviting people to a brawl, to come on over to the other side of the chamber and have a bit of a biffo during the exchange? I think it is stretching the behaviour and the standards a bit far when we actually have members calling people over to step outside. The only other time I have actually seen it occur—and the member for Bass might want to run back to his seat—was with the member for O'Connor in a previous parliament, where he was attempting to—</span>

Out of deference to her former position as Speaker of the House, I listened very carefully to what the member had to say. But I have made the same ruling as she made and Speaker Jenkins made, that the only questions to the Speaker are ones that relate to administration. However, if there have been instances of invitation, shall we say, to affray then they are quite unseemly and out of order, and they will desist.</span>

What rubs salt into the wound for students right around the country is that the Minister for Education, who does not like students very much, went on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> program on Sunday and said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what he forgot to mention was that, when he said students will be the winners, he did not mean students from low-SES backgrounds; he did not mean women; he did not mean students from regional areas; he did not mean students who do not have the limitless funds that are required now to pay for his university degrees; he did not mean the types of kids that we want in our university system, who now might baulk at the extraordinary cost that it takes—</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. On this side of the House, we reject their narrow and elitist view of higher education, just as we reject their narrow and elitist view of the country more generally. It says it all about the government that they want university study to be the preserve of the wealthiest people in our community, the preserve of the few, and not something that the broad range of Australians, whether they are from lower SES backgrounds or otherwise, can access. They want to take us back to the bad old days, where university was just for the kids from the fanciest suburbs, with the most well-to-do parents and from the most expensive schools, and we reject their approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with this government is that, while the whole world is concentrating on how they combat inequality, how they invest in human capital, how they do the right thing by the broad mass of their people to get the right kind of economic growth—while the rest of the world is seeing that as a challenge—this government sees rising inequality as an objective. We know this because the cuts that it has made to the higher education system in this budget will hurt the poorest kids the most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, we believe that access to higher education should be about the contents of your mind and the contents of your imagination and not the contents of your wallet. If we are serious about building the right kind of economy into the future, we should be investing in all of our young people and giving them the access to higher education that they deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality about this budget is that the government have Australia hurtling in the wrong direction. It is worth reminding the House of the list of cuts that they have put into higher education in this budget. There is $5 billion in cuts to higher education in the budget. There is $3.2 billion in cuts to HECS. There is $1.9 billion in cuts to universities by reductions in government course subsidies. There is $202 million in cuts by indexing university grants to the CPI. There is $172 million in cuts to funding to promote and reward universities for enrolling low-SES students. There is $173 million in cuts to the training of Australia's research students, the scientists and academics of tomorrow. There is a $75 million cut to the Australian Research Council. There is a $31 million cut to the national regulator. They have abolished the $3.5 billion Education Investment Fund, and they have deregulated student fees from 1 January 2016, leading to higher fees and spiralling student debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier on, in question time, the member for Hotham asked a very good question about how many of the current cabinet had had access to a free university education or affordable HECS. In his answer, the Minister for Education said that he has not done a study of that front bench. Well, we have. We have done a study of their front bench. What we discovered is that—depending on which biography you have a look at—something like 12 or 13 of the 19 people in the Abbott cabinet benefited from either a free education or affordable HECS. Twelve or 13 of the 19 had some aspect of their university education provided for free by the taxpayer. I will not take the House's time by running through them all, but, when the education minister got up here before and talked about the opportunities provided to kids, the reality is that, as the member for Hotham said, he is slamming the door on people who want the same sorts of opportunities that he had when it comes to affordable HECS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree with the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Canberra, Stephen Parker, who said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I … think it is unethical for a generation of leaders who by and large benefited from free higher education to burden the generations behind them in this way …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think he makes a very good point. The education minister went on the Alan Jones show yesterday, and he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… they should be buying a bunch of flowers and a box of chocolates and visiting a home near them where they know someone hasn't been to university, knocking on the front door and saying thank you very much for paying for my education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My advice to the Minister for Education is: he should go into some of the lower SES areas and knock on their door and explain to them why he wants to extinguish the dreams that they have for a higher education in this country. The reality is that those opposite are in denial and disarray when it comes to higher education in this country.</span>

                  </a>  No. Or (c) the Treasurer's statement that HECS loans 'shouldn't be different to any other loan'? Is it (a), (b), (c) or (d) none of the above? The answer, of course, is that none of the above turned out to be true.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The education minister has been running around today trying to pretend that these changes will cost an extra $3 a week for students, or $5 a week, something like the middy that the Treasurer talks about so regularly. I refer him to the Universities Australia modelling which was released today, which shows that an engineering graduate's HECS debt will go from $49,000 to $119,000 and take 26 years to pay off instead of 18 years. That is the magnitude of the changes we are talking about. That is why the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Adelaide said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… it is starting to look as if the student debt burden for many under the proposed reforms might well be worse than in the US.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The House should be aware that the United States' student debt has tripled in the last eight years. That vice-chancellor is talking about Australia dwarfing that outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We did some of our own calculations. Instead of $3 to $5 a week, based on the Universities Australia report a nurse might pay an extra $15 a week—that is a very conservative estimate—and an engineering graduate who takes some time off for work might pay an extra $82 a week, so I think we can dismiss the $3 to $5 figures pretty easily. The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's the ordinary Australians that I think aren't getting enough of a guernsey in this conversation …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He is right. So many different vice-chancellors and people who know more about the education system than the Minister for Education have expressed their alarm about this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that this goes to the core of what kind of country we want to be in the future. How we invest in higher education is one of the most important determinants of how we will go as a nation into the future. Instead of tackling those sorts of big issues we have an education minister who goes on <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> on Sunday and talks about student politics, still fighting the Cold War on the uni campus. He says, 'My job is to fight the Left,' and he puffs his chest up about student politics. There are all kinds of quotes that reveal that this is about settling scores from when he was at university. This should be a far more important conversation than the Minister for Education implies in those sorts of comments. It goes to the type of country we want to be. It goes to whether we have a big vision for Australia or whether we have a narrow, elitist vision for Australia. In that sense it goes to the very core of our national identity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are serious about building economic growth into the future, we want more people to have the types of tools of success that you get at university, not less. We do not want to narrow or diminish the pool of success stories that we can have into the future in our economy. We want to have a more expansive higher education system, not less. We want a more inclusive economy in this country. What the government shows with the cuts to higher education in this budget and what it shows about the difference between that side and this side is that on this side of the House we want fairness and access in higher education to be part of the country's future and on that side of the House they just want it to be part of their past. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="FKL" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FRYDENBERG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  It is my great privilege to stand up and rebut this MPI. The member for Rankin should know better—the member for Rankin, who has a PhD, just like the member for Fraser. The member for Rankin and the member for Fraser should know that the future of the higher education sector in this country relies on deregulation. It relies on excellence. It relies on quality. It relies on choice. I am very proud to be a member of a government that has produced an important budget which will pay back Labor's debt—nearly $300 billion—over the next 10 years and will put in place measures which will encourage growth, encourage job creation and boost productivity. Central to that thesis is our higher education reforms, the greatest reforms in 30 years. We are the party of Menzies, and Menzies gave us the Murray committee and the Wills committee and an expansion in the university sector. This is the next stage in strengthening our higher education sector. You opposite have no ideas, no alternatives and no policies. The member for Maribyrnong gets up here in his budget reply speech full of cliches but no policies, no alternatives, no hope for the higher education sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures in this budget as they relate to higher education are a great leap forward for the sector. What do they do? For the first time they put significant government support in favour of students who are undertaking diplomas, students who are undertaking pre-bachelor degrees. For the first time they will receive significant support: up to 80,000 students will for the first time get their opportunity as a result of the federal government giving them support. We are saying to apprentices that they will be able to access government loans in the same way that tertiary students can, because taxpayers should not just support those people who go to university, they should also support those people who undertake apprenticeships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is more, in these reforms, $1 in $5 that is taken by the universities as a result of the deregulation in fees will go towards Commonwealth scholarships to help those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and from the regions—the very people that you are now turning your back on by denying us support for these higher education reforms. Those opposite are standing in the way of a commitment by this government to increase the funding for higher education: $900 million of additional Commonwealth funding that will go to higher education and research over the next four years. And how much for schools? An extra $3½ billion in additional funding will go to schools as a result of this budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an education budget. This is a budget for the future of Australia and Australians. We are investing in higher education, in research, to the tune of more than $900 million in additional money over the next four years and $3½ billion of additional money to schools—money that would never have flowed if you had been successful last year in the election. Not to mention the $20 billion investment in the Medical Research Future Fund: the biggest investment of its kind anywhere in the world. That is going to be our legacy. That is what those opposite are in denial about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you see those students rioting about these changes, you could be forgiven for thinking that they were paying for their university education up-front. No, they are not. Do you know why? Because you do not pay $1 back on your university funding until your income is above $50,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me repeat that. You do not pay $1 upfront for your tertiary degree until your income is above $50,000. And what is more—and the Minister for Education has pointed this out repeatedly in the House, in the press and at every opportunity—even when, as a student, you have paid back your higher education fees through HECS-HELP you have only contributed 40 per cent of the cost of your higher education. Sixty per cent of the cost of your higher education is picked up by the taxpayer. That is an important point: even when you have paid back your HECS-HELP fees, you have only paid back 40 per cent of the cost of your degree.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As has also been pointed out, people who undertake a university degree, on average, earn 75 per cent more over their working lifetime than those who do not get the benefit of a university degree. It accounts to about $1 million extra income earned by those who have a university degree, as opposed to those who do not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms are not just about boosting the quantity of students who are able to get a good education, boosting choice and helping those in the regions to get the best education; it is also about excellence. Because when we look at the world rankings of universities, we see that Australia has five in the top 100 and not one in the top 30. We as a country put great emphasis on excellence and everything we do and, in most endeavours, we will be in the top 30 of the world. But not in higher education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms are designed to give universities flexibility and to empower them to take extra money and reinvest it in the classroom, in the best-quality teachers, in the best possible infrastructure, in the best possible technology and to compete against other universities, particularly in our region, which are receiving more funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not want you to take my word for the fact that this is a good package of measures, I want to read some of the third-party endorsements. The Regional Universities Network said, following the budget:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Regional Universities Network (RUN) welcomes the announcement in the Budget of an ambitious program of reform for higher education which recognises the importance of the sector to Australia. The Treasurer and the Minister are to be congratulated for highlighting the important role Universities play in Australia's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about the statement from the University of Adelaide's vice-chancellor, who is probably well known to the member for Hindmarsh:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Federal Budget has outlined massive and much needed reform to the higher education sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about the statement from outgoing vice-chancellor, Professor Ed Byrne, of Monash University, a university I was proud to attend? He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The approach in the budget lays out a series of steps for an ambitious deregulation of the sector. The future of universities will be more in their own hands than ever before. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are very powerful words. They are testimonies, as the member for Riverina has pointed out, of the significance of the budget reforms that we have put in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would not be a speech in response to Labor's MPI unless we quoted the member for Fraser, the shadow Assistant Treasurer. I am quoting from <span style="font-style:italic;">Imagining Australia</span>. I am not imagining Australia; I am quoting from <span style="font-style:italic;">Imagining Australia</span>. I am not imagining this; this is from his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Imagining Australia</span>. I bet he wishes he was imagining this! This is what the member for Fraser, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Australian universities (should) be free to set student fees according to the market value of their degrees. A deregulated or market-based HECS will make the student contribution system fairer, because the fees students pay will more closely approximate the value they receive through future earnings.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could not have said it better myself. In fact, the member for Fraser should have been the first speaker on our side. This MPI is a load of rubbish, it is not even believed by those opposite. We have the better policies for higher education. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:34</span>):  While the list of those in the Australian community betrayed by the recent Abbott government's budget is a long one, there is no betrayal that is more bitter than the betrayal of the people in our community who are dreaming of building a better life for themselves through hard work and education. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the last election, the coalition's <span style="font-style:italic;">Real Solutions</span> policy pamphlet promised Australians who hoped to one day earn a university degree that the Liberal Party would:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now know that that was just another lie, a fib, a fabrication, a falsehood. Existing funding arrangements for our universities will not continue under the policies released in the federal budget. In fact, the budget indicates that Commonwealth government higher education expenditure for this year will actually decline in real terms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, students will be slugged with massive increases in both their upfront uni fees and the costs of their university debts. In fact, Universities Australia today said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">With the reduction in the Government contribution, the student contribution to course fees will rise by an average of 23 per cent. For some courses the increase will be closer to 60 per cent. This could be much higher at institutions with strong market power and in the absence of an upfront cost to mute the price signal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Bruce Chapman, the man who designed the original HECS policy, has stated that as a result of these changes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Fees will go up and they will go up quite significantly …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And further:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I expect most universities will increase tuition fees to international student fee levels, which are currently about three times higher. The Group of Eight universities will do that pretty quickly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Chapman also slapped down the desperate claims of those opposite that competition might prevent this from occurring, stating blankly:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The idea fees will go down anywhere is frankly fantasy land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of this betrayal, the Minister for Education had the hide to tell the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> program: 'Students will always be the winners,' as a result of the Abbott government's massive university fees hike.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If students will always be the winners, my question for the Minister for Education is: how will students be winners of what the vice-chancellor of the University of Adelaide has suggested could be a 'student debt burden that is worse than that in the United States'. Student debt burden in that country has tripled in the last eight years and is now larger than total US credit card debt. How will students be winners from decades of debt and a new interest obligation that will increase an unpaid student debt of $40,000 to almost $60,000 over a 10-year period? How will existing students be winners from having the debt burden of their already incurred university debts retrospectively jacked up to a rolling average of the government bond rate? It's an utter nonsense and those opposite know it. To bastardise Hot Chocolate: 'Everyone's a winner, baby—that's a lie!' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest losers from the government's plans to massively hike university fees will be families from disadvantaged backgrounds like some families in my electorate. There are few things that give people more pride than seeing the first member of their family attend university. I have seen families in my electorate speak about this. It is a great achievement and one that requires a lot of hard work and sacrifice, not only from the students themselves but from the family members around them. The government's plan to massively hike university fees will destroy this dream for many of these families. The Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University in my own electorate, Professor Peter Dawkins, has already said that the equity impacts of the government's proposals are 'the biggest question mark against these reforms'. In the inaugural Mitchell Institute policy lecture, Professor Dawkins noted: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear that the burden on students will rise significantly and with interest being charged from the time the student commences, significantly higher levels of debt will accumulate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His conclusion was that this risked discouraging students from low socio-economic backgrounds from starting university. This view is shared by the man who designed the original HECS scheme, Bruce Chapman, who recently noted: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Past changes to HECS didn't deter students from entering university, but now that there will be a real rate of interest on the debt we are in uncharted waters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He noted that the 'real interest subsidy' in the original HECS scheme was an important and deliberate feature of the scheme designed to ensure the policy's equity. He further noted: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The interest rate subsidy is there for protection. A lot of people, particularly women, will spend time out of the labour force, child-rearing, or people will have accidents and have bad luck and end up in poor jobs. When you think HECS you've got to think about insurance all the time. That's what it is—it insures you against bad luck … Once you put a real interest rate on that, that's gone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bruce Chapman is right. This government's plans to massively increase university fees take the equity out of our higher education system. If this legislation gets through the equity is gone. It will be a broken promise that betrays Australia's future. Labor has always fought for an accessible, high-quality education system. We would never introduce a system as unfair and inequitable as the one that those opposite are proposing and we will fight to make sure that the proposals never eventuate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:39</span>):  I do not know whether the member for Gellibrand actually went to university but it is not 'bastardise', it is 'paraphrase', and I did not go to university. Anyone who goes around quoting Hot Chocolate really has to have a really hard look at themselves. Maybe you could quote some Bruce Springsteen or someone like that, 'down by the river' or something like that, so you have something really worth going to. I have sat through 15 minutes of this now and I have to ask what the actual question is here. What is actually being asked here? It seems to me that in this matter of public importance they are asking for free education. They seem to be saying that all fees are bad, there is nothing good in this. We have to go back and say, 'Where were you guys when HECS was brought in by your party?' That is okay. So some debt is okay but it is just Liberal debt that is not okay. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you go through this you really have to sit there and look at it. It is their ability to latch on to change. We would have thought that with the last parliament they would have been right up with change, that there will be no problems with change at all. 'There will be no carbon tax on the government I lead—hey, we are for a carbon tax. Away we go. We are not going to change private health—hey, we are up for a change of private health. We can accept change, we accept change all the time.' Oh no, when it is proposed by somebody else it is all out: we cannot change anything. 'Don't change anything, because we are glass half empty people.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will tell you a couple of things about this. We are coming up to the World Cup. In the last World Cup we had the member for Grayndler saying we were a vuvuzela of negativity. I cannot wait to see the musical instrument that the Brazilians will be using, but can I tell you I might wax lyrical about the Brazilians! There is a complete and utter lack of any coherence in anything that they are doing at the moment other than saying it is bad. Whether they choose to believe anything that we put forward, no-one in this parliament can deny that over the last six years you guys clocked up over $190 billion worth of debt. The first thing you have to do is figure that out. So we have to look at ways of making sure that people have access. When things are broke, when there is no cash, who pays? The poorest pay. So we have to look at getting people who are the most exposed into higher education. That is what our policy does: it opens up another 80,000 places. For every $5 extra that is paid in HECS one dollar goes into the Commonwealth scholarship scheme, the greatest scholarship scheme this country will ever see. It is specifically targeting low SES people who would never otherwise get a chance. But 'No, we don't want that, we don't want that.' You blokes just talk a good game about people from disadvantaged backgrounds. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I come from Townsville where we have James Cook University. It has three campuses, in Townsville, Cairns and Singapore. They are keen for competition. They say: 'Bring on the competition because we are up for it because we have a science degree that stands alone on absolutely everything. We have people coming from all over the world for our science degree and our marine science degrees and our coral reef studies. We have people coming from all over the place, from all over the world to get into that degree. In our science degree we have our Daintree outlook, we have our cattle station and we have Orpheus Island.' There is a degree that will stand alone against any form of competition for anything. James Cook University is rated number one in the world on coral reef studies and marine sciences. They say, 'Bring on the competition because we can handle the competition.' We just invested another $42 million in James Cook University for the Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine. There are 3.6 billion people of middle-class by 2035 to the north of Australia in the Asian century and we are ready for it because we embrace competition. We open it up and say, 'Bring it on.' Those opposite are looking at their bellybuttons saying, 'Nothing can change, just roll on past like a tumbleweed.' You are wasting everyone's time. Just get out of the road because you guys are in the Melbourne Cup and you have not gone past the post the first time. We are coming down the straight again and you are standing there dawdling in the road. Get the fag out of your mouth, move out of the road and get yourself a job.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms O'NEIL:</span>
                  </a>  I understand, Deputy Speaker. I went a little overboard there. I do apologise. But I will say that there are half-truths, there are perversities and there are contradictions and no more so than in the proposed changes to higher education. When we think about winners and losers, I can tell you that the losers from these changes will be the young people who are sitting out there watching this debate today from the gallery. These changes will see universities auctioning their degrees to the highest bidders. The introduction of commercial, compound interest rates will see those much higher loans growing every year. What experts are saying is that, with the new changes, universities will charge what they are currently charging overseas students today. Overseas students doing a law degree at Sydney university pay $140,000. For a nursing degree at Sydney university, they pay $88,500. The interest rate changes will mean that a student who finishes university with a $40,000 debt will pay $75,000. A woman who finishes her university degree and goes into a job that is not particularly high paid may never pay off her loan in her whole working life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember, these changes are being made by a cabinet, of whom 12, as we know, went to university completely for free. It is absolutely perverse. They use their free education to get power and position and now they are using that power and position to slam the door in the face of other young people in Australia who want to access those opportunities. We know from what other speakers have talked about that, very unfortunately but not surprisingly, the biggest impact of these changes is going to be on students from low-income families. I probably should not need to say this, but, without equal access to education, all of us are going to lose. The member for Rankin spoke quite eloquently about the need to try to not limit access to university education but get as many young people in this country to university as we can. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has argued that young people from low-income families will not be deterred by these huge fees. This is hogwash. It absolutely defies expert opinion and just plain common sense. A detailed study by Deloitte Access Economics on changes to HECS has shown that, where reductions in university demand have happened in Australia, they have been almost all from students who have come from disadvantaged backgrounds. I have talked to quite a lot of local principals about the changes, and their frustration is absolutely palpable. I want to quote one of the local principals who said to me: 'The amounts that are being talked about will absolutely scare my students away. For these kids, a sum like $100,000 is a TattsLotto win. It's an unimaginable amount of money.' They point out to me the pressure that these young people are already facing within their families to go out and earn more quickly. They think that these increases in fees will be enough to shift the balance, not just subtly but a lot. But the biggest impost they point to with these changes is the impact they could have on the culture in their schools right down the line. These principals tell me that they work so hard to produce environments of excellence and a belief that these students can go on to do anything they want in life, but this culture is being completely undermined by a university system that will see many of them locked out of tertiary education. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has argued that there are increases to Commonwealth scholarships and therefore this, of course, answers the access question. This is staggeringly unfair. Why should only a handful of the best and brightest young Australians from low-income families go to university when students from much wealthier homes will get much broader access to education? In Australia, that is just not how we do things. I can say that, as Labor, we will never tell Australians that the quality of their education depends on their capacity to pay. A country like ours should be a meritocracy and nothing aside from your intellect and drive should determine whether and where you go to university. But this is not how things are in Tony Abbott's Australia. If you are a white, privileged male, the government has got your back. But if you are poor, if you are a woman, if you drive a car, if you live in a region, if you are an older Australian, if you are a student, if you are a single mum, and especially if you are a young person, you had better watch out, because these guys are coming for you. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:49</span>):  I want to thank the member for Hotham for her question in question time. It was a brilliant question—a brilliant question about who brought in HECS in Australia. I think it was fascinating to remind the House that it was the Keating administration who first came up with the notion that it was fair, very fair, for a student to contribute to the cost of their education. It is a fair principle. It is a principle that we should seek to reinforce in Australian education today, and this government is seeking to reinforce it. The only thing that could have made the member for Hotham's presentation a little better would have been a glass of chardonnay, because it was chardonnay socialism at its best. This is not about poor students. This is not about people on the breadline. This is about reinforcing the privileges of those upper middle-class kids at uni who are being paid for by poor students who do not go to universities. That is what this is about. People who go to universities are subsidised by the rest of our community. They are subsidised by people who never have a prospect of entering university and who, on average, have much lower incomes. We know that, when you get an education degree, it is an economic asset; it stays with you for the rest of your life. It is only fair that you make a contribution to that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that this government is expanding this scheme. We are not just expanding the cost incurred by a student; we are expanding access. The MPI that has come up today is really from the D team. There is no shadow minister. Nobody of really any note moved this motion. It is the D team. Maybe it is the F team.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HAWKE:</span>
                  </a>  The interjections are from the F team. Those opposite say that this measure is unfair when the government is expanding access for the first time under the HECS to diploma, advanced diploma and associated degrees—a notion that any Labor government should have been proud of. It is a notion that the Hawke government would have been proud to put forward. It is a notion that the Keating government would have been happy to put forward. But we have this new chardonnay socialism from those over there. These members from the inner city suburbs of Melbourne really need to get out more. They need to leave the inner city of Melbourne and get out more and find a real student, a real struggling student. This is the same Labor Party that supported compulsory unionism for students. It supported high fees for students, making them pay out of their pockets, regardless of the equity issues, compulsory union fees. They were happy to take $1,000. When I went to Sydney university they were happy to take money from me for their compulsory student unionism even though I came from Western Sydney and did not have a high income.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But when we say people should make a contribution to their own education, they claim there is something wrong with that. Well, it was Paul Keating's notion. It was a worthy notion and one that this government is expanding because we need to ensure greater equality of access to universities. We need to make sure we have universities of the highest standard in the world. We do not have a university in the top 30; we need to get one. Deregulating the sector is nothing to be afraid of; it is a worthy concept and it is a worthy set of programs to put forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you hear this lame set of arguments from the D team opposite, you really get the sense that this is a revolution without a cause. With the Minister for Education, I had the chance to be in Sydney to see the predictable Green Left Resistance, with their soulless eyes, addictively chanting. They do not even know what they are chanting. 'What are we chanting? Well, we are revolutionaries so let's have a revolution!'—a revolution of revolutionaries. They are like the Zapatistas in Mexico—revolution for revolution's sake. They do not even know what it is about. They do not understand that you do have to pay for things in life, that there is no such thing as a free education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Rankin is absolutely wrong to come in here and suggest education is free in this country and that somehow he is going to do something to alleviate the need to pay fees. People have to get a signal early in life that you have to make a contribution to your own education. It is only right and proper. A university degree is an economic asset that will stay with you all of your life. On average, people who have one will earn $1 million more than others. This is chardonnay socialism at its worst. This is not on behalf of poor people, this is not on behalf of socially disadvantaged people. It is on behalf of the inner suburbs of Melbourne, the chardonnay socialists in the Labor Party. They are disconnected from their trade union background, they are disconnected from the ordinary worker, they are disconnected from their base—and I say long may it remain so. Keep fighting for those inner city spivs in Melbourne and Sydney, stick up for them hard! It is only right and proper that people make a contribution to their education. It is a principle established by both Labor and Liberal governments. Really, this motion today is absolutely pathetic. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Charlton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:54</span>):  I enjoy being lectured about career achievement by a man who has spent seven years in here not making a single mark! If we are the F Troop, he has got to be the Z Troop—and he is sitting amongst others there! This is a debate about a nasty government pursuing an ideological agenda. The inconsistency on their side is remarkable. We heard from the first speaker about paying down Labor's debt. And then we had the black is white story, that this is actually about equality of access, that liberating students from their money will give them greater chances in their attempt to get an education. The truth is that education is a great enabler. Like many on this side, I am proud that I am the first on my mum's side of the family to go to uni. I am not one of these chardonnay socialists. I am someone who went to university. I paid HECS in an affordable manner, indexed to the CPI, and had plenty of time to pay it back. What they are doing on that side is shutting the door on more kids from working-class backgrounds going to uni. They are shutting the door by introducing $5 billion of funding cuts. They are shutting the door by jacking up fees. They are shutting the door by applying commercial interest rates that will force working-class students to think twice about going to uni.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my regional seat of Charlton 34 per cent of graduates are nurses, teachers or from allied health occupations. They are not lawyers, they are not doctors. They disprove the myth being peddled by the Minister for Education that all graduates will earn $1 million more than average workers. That is utter rubbish! I am proud that I have in my electorate the biggest hospital between Brisbane and Sydney. It has 120 nurse graduates entering this year. But it is going to struggle to get new nurses coming through because they are going to be turned off by this fee hike. According to research by Universities Australia a new nurse entering training now will see their fees go up—once you add the interest—from $23,000 to $98,000. How is that fair? How is it fair to ask a poor working-class kid, who wants to be a nurse to help out in our health system, to pay $98,000 instead of $23,000 over a reasonable amount of time with CPI indexation? They will be paying that money for 25 years. They will be 48 before they are able to pay off their debt—if they are lucky.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And teachers do not earn $1 million more than an average worker. I received an email from Jacqui, a year 11 student at Jesmond High in my region. She said: 'For a long time now, all I have wanted to do is study primary school teaching at Newcastle uni. I was disappointed and angry to discover that instead of my degree costing $19,000 over four years it will now cost around double that. I have worked out that, on a teacher's salary of $59,000 per year, it will take nearly 14 years to pay back my HECS debt. With interest, I would have paid a total of around $90,000. This figure will be higher if it takes me longer to get a job or I spend time out of the workforce for family reasons.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the truth behind this inequitable policy. This is the truth when you look at students who go to the University of Newcastle, the best uni in Australia under 50 years of age, where 27 per cent of students come from a low-SES background. They are not the chardonnay socialists the member for Mitchell railed against; they are kids from low- and middle-income families who will be turned off by these huge fee hikes and by the deregulation of uni fees. This will place a real barrier against their entry to university. This is a great betrayal of the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I look at MPI debates, I like to see what those opposite said before the election. I go to that great document <span style="font-style:italic;">Our Plan: Real Solutions </span><span style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span style="font-style:italic;">or All Australians</span>, which the Prime Minister hid behind. It was his shield whenever a journalist had the temerity to ask him a question about anything before the election. 'Just look at my pamphlet. The pamphlet has got everything I stand by—and it is in writing, so you can trust what I'm saying'—it is in writing, so it must be true! If we go to page 41, we can read a firm commitment from the Prime Minister, a paragon of virtue and honesty: 'We will ensure the continuation of the current arrangements in university funding.' That is pretty direct; there are no ifs or buts. The truth is that this is an important debate because those on the other side stand for the betrayal of low- and middle-income families and their chances of getting a decent education, getting a degree in nursing or teaching, contributing to our society, advancing their family and maybe being the first in their family to go to university. That door is being shut by the heartless mob over there who are just pursuing a nasty ideological agenda. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  This is a matter of importance to people in my electorate, because regional students have been disadvantaged for a long time. Before I get to that, I must point out the great injustice done by the member for Gellibrand. Hot Chocolate fans all over the world are right now picking up the phone, getting on their computers, sending emails because it is not 'Everyone's a winner, baby, that's no lie'. The great line is: 'Everyone's a winner, baby, that's the truth.' Yes, that is the truth, which is exactly the opposite to what the member for Gellibrand said. As much as I would like to sing in this place, I am sure it would be inappropriate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a serious matter. The people in my electorate are a lot like me. I was born in Bundaberg and had similar opportunities to them. I finished high school in 1986; I graduated with a score which was good enough to get me into university. I had an offer for university, but for me to attend university at that time meant moving to a capital city, and that was an expensive move. Students from regional areas have to travel, pay accommodation, feed themselves. They move away from home; they do not have mum there any more to help them out. They have difficult social challenges. If I had taken that opportunity at that time, the financial disadvantage for my family and my younger brothers would have been far too high, and it was not a price I was willing to pay. So I took a job as an apprentice electrician, and it was a wonderful time. Those four years were absolutely fantastic; I worked with some great people in an industrial workplace—a highly unionised workplace—and they were good, honest, hard-working people. They did their best every single day. I loved being an electrician—getting out and doing that work was absolutely great. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, one of those chardonnay drinking engineers who came from somewhere else suggested that I was not smart enough to attend university. So that was the reason I did not go—I was not smart enough. I accepted the challenge in 1992 and went to the Queensland University of Technology as an adult student. I used the money I had saved for four years to attend university. If I had gone in 1987, how much HECS would I have paid? Absolutely none! But in 1992 I had to pay HECS.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PITT:</span>
                  </a>  Quite a lot, but I tell you now, Mr Deputy Speaker, if I had the chance to talk to my skinnier, younger and less grey self, the advice that I would give is very straightforward: take the loan. At that time 10 per cent was the return on money deposited in banks. I should have put my money somewhere else and taken the cheap loan that was provided by taxpayers; the benefits would have been much greater. Instead, I used my own savings. I paid all those fees and got them out of the way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going to university is an opportunity that is not afforded to many regional students, because they simply cannot afford to go. Our policy provides scholarship opportunities for regional students—students from low socio-economic backgrounds, students who would otherwise never get the opportunity to go to university. There are now some universities in my electorate—the University of Southern Queensland's Fraser Coast campus. For first semester 2014 there are 743 students in Hervey Bay. What is the gender split? Seventy-eight per cent are female; 22 per cent male. It is fantastic. There are 29 Indigenous students on campus and 23 external; there are only 11 international students. Of those 743, 367 are mature age and only 187 are school leavers. For a very long time the absolute best export from my electorate was our young talent: they travel to the city, do university and do not come back. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These policies will give opportunities to people in regional areas, make our universities stronger and our regional universities more viable. And that will mean more students. I look forward to the day when our local universities triple in size—not 700, but 2,000 in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay—providing opportunities for our local kids so they can stay at home, attend university—opportunities that city kids have had for many years. I am not talking about opportunities provided by the taxpayer, but things they can do for themselves. In regional areas that is what regional kids are about: they do not want a handout, they just want opportunity and they will seize that opportunity with both hands. With that opportunity they will make this a better country and they will certainly be great for my electorate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  It is a pleasure to rise to speak on this matter of public importance. I thank the member for Rankin for his impassioned and fantastic speech. This is such an important issue because it affects not only the lives of individuals but the future of our country as a whole. It is something I am very passionate about. Like other people who have spoken today, I was the first person in my family to go to university. My parents left school at grade 10; I went to James Cook University and then on to the Queensland University of Technology for my bachelor's degree. I am very proud of that and, frankly, I would not have been able to do it, had it not been for Labor reforms to higher education. I am very proud of the Whitlam reforms and the Hawke reforms with the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act of 1989, which members opposite have spoken about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Higher Education Funding Amendment Act came into force because of a view that there was a limited private benefit to public education, but the public benefit was overwhelmingly greater than the private benefit of that higher education. We know that graduates earn substantially more over the course of a lifetime. What do they do with that higher income? We have a progressive income tax system and, as a consequence, graduates pay more in income tax. That is the way our taxation system works. Yes, we have a HECS system; we have a Higher Education Contribution Scheme. Why shouldn't we recognise that there is some private benefit, but that ought not mean $100,000 of debt over a lifetime for an engineering graduate. Students should not be saddled with debt for their whole life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, I will read to you a few things that I have received in my office about this issue. One is from a constituent. I will read it out in full. She says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">the Prime Minister—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">is out of touch with reality and his budget will lead to considerably higher university costs for mature age students who are being forced to change career so they can continue working until they're 70+. I'm a divorced 48 year old female who raised 2 children most of my life, hence I don't have enough superannuation to retire. For me, retirement is a pipe dream. My career to date has been in office admin - my salary is therefore capped. I'm changing career to become a lawyer so I can become self employed in my own legal practice and work until I'm 80 years old, my mental faculties permitting. Hence, I'm enrolled in a Bachelor of Law, but the Abbott government needs to keep the funding available to mature age people such as myself who are being forced into re-education and a change of career so they can work longer. Mr Abbott you can't have your cake and eat it too. Fair go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what one of my constituents, who is a mature-age student, has said to me. It is not just young people who are being forced into debt. But when it comes to young people, when you think about that idea of having $100,000 of debt to be paid off over a lifetime—that is for an engineering student, and it is not my number; it is Universities Australia's number—that is 20 to 25 years worth of repayment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Think about the fact that women will often take more time out of the workforce to raise children. What is the consequence? It takes them longer to pay off their debt. That is the consequence. And when you increase the interest rate to six per cent per annum that debt is going to grow and grow. So you are going to saddle them with more debt, it is going to take them longer to pay it off and their debt is going to be higher because they have taken time out of the workforce. That is the sort of legacy that the Liberal-Nationals are leaving this country. They should be ashamed of themselves.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, these are not my numbers; these are the numbers of Universities Australia, that well-known, as the members opposite have described us, chardonnay socialist group—I don't think.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, when we are talking about the deregulation of university fees so that universities can charge higher fees, the higher interest rate and the lower repayment threshold, let us not forget the massive cuts to higher education in this government's 2014 budget—$5 billion in cuts to higher education and university research.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  I have really enjoyed the scare campaign about universities put forward by the other side. You would think, for some crazy reason, that all universities are going to close down or that everyone is going to be charged a huge amount of money. The thing that those opposite fail to acknowledge is that it is their own side that originally came up with many of these deregulatory ideas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at the contribution of the member for Rankin, who spoke about the accessibility of universities to low-socioeconomic demographics. To start with, we are actually extending what we are doing with trade and apprenticeships—$20,000 is what we are going to give to incentivise people to go in through the TAFE system. I went through the TAFE system and then went into the University of Western Sydney. This is where incentivising people through some of the other types of gateway courses is so crucial. If you look at the University of Western Sydney, which is in my electorate, you would think that, by the deregulation, universities are irresponsible institutions. The fact is that universities are not irresponsible institutions. They are thoughtful institutions. They are institutions that think about their students. They are institutions that think about the future, about how they going to create future leaders. Already because of the scare campaign of those opposite we have had eight universities come out and say, 'No, we're actually going to freeze our fees.' They include the University of Western Sydney, the university from my own electorate; Griffith University, I am sure the member for Griffith would like to know that; Deakin University; Victoria University; Flinders University; Murdoch University; and Edith Cowan University. By freezing university fees they are providing security to students so they know what their fees are going to be. The members opposite are running around trying to scare everyone by saying that university fees are going to go into some exorbitant place. What they are not actually saying is that universities are responsible institutions. What they are not talking about is how we are going to provide more gateway opportunities for people to get university. We are talking about 80,000 additional places. That is what we are doing here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go back to the University of Western Sydney. It is a wonderful institution in my electorate. The University of Western Sydney is once again investing. It invests in health and research. It is looking at how it can grow the education sector in this country. It is also going overseas to places like China. It is seeing how it can be more internationally competitive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a fabulous foreign affairs minister, and with the Colombo Plan and what they are doing with taking university students to China and from China back to Australia we are seeing our universities finally become internationally competitive. Under those opposite we saw our universities drop out of the top 100 universities in the world. This deregulation, together with the Colombo Plan and getting people into universities through gateway programs, will see our university sector once again be internationally competitive. If we want to have future leaders, if we want to have future thought leaders within our communities we need competitive universities. We need universities that are going to lead by example. We need universities that invest in research and funding. We will be investing in research so that our universities can go out there and find the research projects that will take us into the next millennium.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at what this is all about we will see that this is about providing future leaders. This is about providing university to more people. We want to talk about people in low-socioeconomic demographic areas. Sometimes getting through year 12 is not necessarily the easiest thing in the world, so finding gateway programs that will take people into university is so crucial. If you actually want to help people in low-socioeconomic demographic areas—if you want to provide university opportunities to get the mechanic who has done his trade to become a mechanical engineer—you help him get his trade and then you help him get to university to be able to become a mechanical engineer. That is what I did. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March 2010 the United States Congress enacted the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, also known as FATCA. The aim of the act was to improve compliance with US tax laws. FATCA imposed certain due diligence and reporting obligations on non-US financial institutions, including Australian institutions. Two years after the passing of FATCA, the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan, the then Treasurer, met with United States Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner in Washington and issued a statement on 7 November 2012 announcing that Australia had commenced formal discussions for an intergovernmental agreement with the United States to minimise the impact for Australians of FATCA. That statement noted that an intergovernmental agreement would also improve existing reciprocal tax information-sharing arrangements between the Australian Taxation Office and the United States Internal Revenue Service, which would help ensure Australian tax laws are effectively enforced so that Australian businesses and individuals who pay their fair share of tax are not disadvantaged by those who seek to evade their tax obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the agreement which has been signed with the United States and was announced by the Treasurer on 28 April this year, we now have an intergovernmental agreement which sees Australian financial institutions complying with FATCA. Under this arrangement, a broad range of Australian financial institutions are affected: banks, building societies, credit unions, specified life insurance companies, investment funds, custodial institutions and some brokers. Those financial institutions are to be required to register with the US IRS. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this bill, from 1 July 2014 the affected financial institutions will review customer accounts to determine whether they are reportable accounts, US citizens or US tax residents under the intergovernmental agreement and will report to the ATO in the 2015 calendar year the required account information for the 2014 calendar year, which will then be passed on from the ATO to the IRS. This bill puts in place those appropriate arrangements in order to see Australian institutions complying with FATCA. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is pleasing for those of us on this side of the House to see the end of these negotiations, begun under the member for Lilley and concluded under this government. The Labor Party welcomes sensible steps to assist tax authorities in ensuring compliance with tax regulations. What we are concerned about, however, is that while the government has managed to conclude this deal, it has dropped the ball on multinational profit shifting. More than $1 billion of loopholes have been opened up under this government, which will allow multinational firms to shift profits overseas. So while dual Australian-US citizens will be affected by FATCA, the multinationals will be able to continue to shift profits overseas. In a speech earlier today I listed the measures, five of them, on which the government has backtracked. The total amount is $1.1 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Multinational profit shifting is a painfully detailed area and we were fortunate in government to have Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury focusing on these reforms for us. It might be helpful to the House if I outline in straightforward terms how multinational firms shift profits out of Australia and into low-tax jurisdictions. One simple example that members might think about is an arrangement in which the Bermuda arm of a company sells the Australian arm a paperclip at a cost of $1 million. The Australian company then claims that as a $1 million tax deduction and the money is effectively shifted offshore. That particular loophole has been closed, but a parallel trick can still be played with debt, in which the Bermuda subsidiary makes a multimillion dollar loan to the Australian arm and effectively $1 million a year is shifted out of Australia in the form of interest payments. Those interest payments are a tax deduction in Australia and the profit can be moved to Bermuda, where the company tax rate is considerably lower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concern that the Labor Party has on this is that multinational profit shifting will invariably become more tempting as industries internationalise. As more and more business is done over the internet, we are moving from a closed economy to a very, very open economy. And a government which is going soft on multinational profit shifting is a government which is increasingly going to miss out on revenue. Australia already has a higher than average share of revenue collected from company taxes, and so failing to close company tax loopholes is a significant issue for Australia. And because this government is unwilling to close corporate tax loopholes it has to do things like taking money away from children on the first day of school—getting rid of the schoolkids bonus payments, which is targeted towards low- and middle-income households, because it is going soft on multinational profit shifting. The Treasurer talks the big talk when he is at the G20, as the Prime Minister does when he is at Davos. But when it comes to actually walking into this House and passing bills which see multinationals pay their fair share of tax, this government is not up to the job. As a consequence, ordinary Australians will have to pay more tax or receive lower services. </span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If I go back to the PEFO—as we know, the PEFO is where the officials tell the truth about what the budget really is from the previous government. From the previous Government, that's what it does, that's what it does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A little repetitious, but you get the idea. PEFO is the true state of the books, so let's compare where we are at under the true state of the books, the Charter of Budget Honesty state of the books, with the current budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current budget's deficit is higher this year. It is higher next year and it is higher over the forward estimates. So what the government has done effectively in this budget is to redistribute resources—redistribute them from the most vulnerable to the most affluent. This is not only a failure of the fair-go test, because those who were most vulnerable have, after all, been doing it worse over the past generation, a generation in which incomes have risen faster for billionaires than for battlers, but now we have a budget that transfers resources from battlers to billionaires. A simple example of that: the budget raises the non-concessional superannuation cap pushing it from $150,000 to $180,000—a measure which will help some of the most affluent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the vulnerable Australians do not just have low incomes; they also spend a larger share of their incomes. In fact if you look at those in the bottom income group, they tend to spend all of their incomes; and those in the top quintile tend to save about a quarter of their incomes. So, if you take $10 billion, you move it from the bottom quintile to the top quintile and then you take $2½ billion out of the economy. What would that do? You would expect it to have a hit on retail trade, and we are already seeing retail trade figures down. You would expect it to have a hit on consumer confidence, and we have the ANZ Roy Morgan Consumer Confidence measure now falling faster than at any time since the global financial crisis. We have the Westpac Melbourne Institute consumer confidence survey at nearly a three-year low. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of what is going on at the Westpac Melbourne Institute consumer confidence survey is that confidence has fallen to a lousy 74.9 among Labor voters. I have news for those opposite: Labor voters may not have supported them in the last election but, if you are a retailer, a dollar coming out of the wallet of a Labor voter is just as good to you as a dollar coming out of the pocket of a coalition voter. This pessimism in the economy is hurting retail trade. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Robert Menzies liked to say that about half the people didn't vote for him at each election and they could not all be wrong. It neatly sums up the value of bipartisanship but it is particularly important when we are thinking about economic policymaking. Governments must govern for all Australians. They must recognise that retailers are depending on the spending of coalition voters and Labor voters alike. But a government which is behaving as political scientist Judith Brett wrote recently like 'a bunch of winners taking it out on the losers … It all feels a bit like student politics and its short-term point-scoring, its payback and its intense personal antagonisms'. A government of that kind is a government which will not engender confidence in the economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps we should not be surprised then that the Australian Institute of Company Directors biannual survey found that fewer than one in three company directors believe the federal government is having a positive impact on their business decisions and consumer confidence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a measure which improves transparency, and it is good to see this government supporting transparency. As Justice Brandeis said—that is not 'the-would-be Justice Brandis'; that is the real United States Justice Louis Brandeis—sunlight is the best disinfectant. I am a strong supporter of transparency, but it does strike me as strange that the government is very keen on transparency for US-Australian citizens in exchanging information between the ATO and IRS but less keen on transparency when it comes to what has happened in our detention centres, what is happening with boats. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission, a commission set up to ensure transparency in the charitable sector and to ensure that Australian donors can see the organisations to which they are donating, the government wants to scrap the ACNC and reduce transparency in the charitable sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is yet to hold a single community cabinet, a great transparency measure introduced under Labor. The government has said that it will not release the Treasury blue books under the freedom of information laws as they were after the two previous elections. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government in another anti-transparency move has taken the Family Impact Statement out of the budget. The family impact statement was put in the budget by Peter Costello, and maintained when the Rudd and Gillard governments were in office. We thought they were a good thing, so we kept them there. This year they disappeared, and families will not be surprised as to why. If you are a family in the bottom quintile in income distribution, families with children lose 6.6 per cent of their disposable income as a result of this budget; they lose more than $1 in $20. The poorest single parent families with children lose more than $1 in $10—$1 in $10 is being taken out of their wallets as a result of this. No wonder the government is backtracking on transparency with the Family Impact Statement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the measure championed by Labor, which would have required the tax commissioner to publish the amount of corporate tax paid for entities with a total income of $100 million or more, the coalition has already sent out strong signals that it is not going to proceed with that particular transparency measure. They were so proud of that particular announcement that they brought it out in the first week of the new year—not normally a time in which you announce the things that you are very excited by—but the time when then Assistant Treasurer Arthur Sinodinos chose to drop the story to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review.</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>We have heard nothing of it so far, but I am deeply concerned that this transparency measure will be dropped as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition supports this sensible measure. The FATCA agreements were initiated under Treasurer Swan and concluded under Treasurer Hockey. I wish the spirit of this bill would better pervade the government's actions. Transparency is good enough for FATCA and it ought to be good enough for other areas of government policymaking. If it is good enough to close down tax loopholes to stop tax minimisation then it ought to be good enough to close down tax loopholes that are allowing a billion dollars of tax owed by multinationals to escape.</span>

                    <a href="242515" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  I want to briefly speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the FATCA Agreement) Bill 2014. I want to congratulate the Treasurer, Joe Hockey, on so quickly coming to the aid of Australian financial institutions and concluding the FATCA agreement. The unilateral decision by the United States has meant that Australian financial institutions with any presence in the United States could be subject to a withholding tax rate of 30 per cent. In announcing the signing of the agreement, the Treasurer highlighted the importance of this change in reducing the burden on Australian financial institutions and in particular that due diligence that would be required from Australian institutions in managing each of the accounts that may or may not be relevant to the FATCA requirements. In order to comply with the relevant reporting obligations, Australian financial institutions would have been required to undertake a range of procedures in identifying all relevant accounts. Broadly, FATCA requires foreign financial institutions to provide the US Internal Revenue Service with information on US citizens living abroad who have more than $50,000 in their accounts. So it is a wide-ranging and significant compliance burden on Australian financial institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commencement of the regime is looming on 1 July 2014, as the member for Fraser said, and it will obviously have a huge impact on Australian financial services. One of the reasons that Australia has had to enter into the agreement with the United States which is now the subject of this bill is that Australian privacy laws generally prevent compliance with these US based regulations and some Australian state and territory antidiscrimination laws could also prevent the interrogation of customer accounts based on US citizenship. In recognition of the fact that many of these domestic laws would otherwise prevent foreign financial institutions from fully complying with FATCA, the US developed an intergovernmental agreement approach to manage these legal impediments, simplify practical implementation and reduce compliance costs for relevant financial institutions. That is why I congratulate the Treasurer, Joe Hockey, for moving so quickly to sign the intergovernmental with the US in April. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As always, this government has its eye on the ball when it comes to making sure that our businesses are not weighed down with red tape and unnecessary administrative costs. Unfortunately, that was not the case when those opposite were in government. Treasurer Joe Hockey was advised soon after last year's election that 96 tax and superannuation announcements, with one dating back as far as March 2001, had not been legislated. One of those announcements related to FATCA. The former Treasurer announced his intention to negotiate an intergovernmental agreement with US on FATCA in November 2012, but it was not signed by the former government. This slack approach was not fair on Australian businesses or consumers and it created uncertainty, particularly with the likelihood of a withholding tax applying to Australian financial institutions. That approach has changed and we have ended the uncertainty with the subject of this bill. We are listening to businesses and consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the Australian Bankers Association welcomed the signing of the intergovernmental agreement. Steven Munchenberg, chief executive of the ABA, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We congratulate the Australian government in securing this agreement. It will enable Australian investors and savers to more easily access the US economy without suffering a prohibitive 30 per cent withholding tax cost. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is an essential development in facilitating capital flows into and out of Australia while having best practice regulation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current and previous governments' work in this area will ensure Australia continues to have one of the world's most competitive financial services sectors, a major factor in economic growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I want to congratulate the Treasurer for ensuring that the uncertainty that applied with the possible application of a withholding tax in the United States is not an issue that Australian financial institutions have to worry about any further. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are of course compliance costs associated with this measure. As a government, we are proud that the approach we have adopted ensures that the compliance costs are the lowest of all the available options. Again, it is to ensure that capital that flows in and out of Australia can be as free as possible and not subject to interest withholding tax. I again congratulate the Treasurer.</span>

As previous speakers have noted, this bill in effect requires Australian financial institutions to collect information about their customers who are likely to be taxpayers in the United States of America and to provide that information to the Australian Taxation Office which will, in turn, provide that information to the US Internal Revenue Service. This of course gives effect to the Australian government's commitments as set out in the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA—the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act—which was signed in Canberra in April 2014, as the member for Deakin noted a moment ago.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">FATCA has been described by <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Economist</span> as 'by far the biggest catalyst' of a movement towards global tax-transparency or, indeed, tax fairness. I note that the UK has also, in the aftermath of FATCA, taken what may be regarded as similar steps to the US, and that the OECD is progressing the implementation of a single global standard for the exchange of relevant information. This year's G20 finance meeting in Sydney endorsed common standards for sharing account information across borders, with automatic exchange taking effect by the end of next year. This is an important development—although, as is the case with the bill before us, there is obviously considerably more work to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note in that regard—and I think the member for Deakin also touched on this—the very important work that the former Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Lilley, did in the lead-up to this bill, by commencing the formal discussions between Australia and the US following a meeting between the Treasurer and US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner in November 2012. I also note the important work that former Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury did in the area of cracking down on corporate profit-shifting and tax minimisation schemes. I congratulate him on his recent elevation at the OECD. It is well deserved and I wish him very well, though I think it is appropriate that I also say that he is very much missed in his former role in this place in the government of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The FATCA is an American law, developed to reduce offshore tax evasion and regain federal tax revenues from American account holders at foreign—that is, non-American—financial institutions internationally. It obviously, in that regard, has implications for Australia and Australia's financial institutions. The impetus for the act in America was a 2009 court case in which Swiss bank UBS was found to have assisted American nationals to evade paying American taxes. As a result, UBS agreed to pay the US government US$780 million in fines, in restitution, and also to provide the names of suspected tax cheats. There has obviously also been some significant subsequent litigation in this area. According to the US Department of Justice, the use of offshore bank accounts to avoid paying American taxes costs the US Treasury, in total, at least US$100 billion annually. This is of course a cost to American society of the same magnitude.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The wide-reaching FATCA was passed in the 111th Congress as part of the 2010 Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, the HIRE Act, becoming law in March 2010, and requires individuals to report their financial accounts held outside of the United States; and foreign—again, that is, non-United States—financial institutions to report to the IRS about their American clients. To enforce the FATCA, it has become necessary for the US government to sign agreements with foreign governments such as Australia's, allowing the trade of individuals' financial data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor welcomes any sensible steps to assist tax authorities, whether in Australia or overseas, to ensure compliance with tax regulations. The Treasurer has acknowledged that some multinationals are not even paying their fair share of tax anywhere and called for a global response. I welcome this, too. But there is more to be done—much more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has demonstrated a significant gap between its rhetoric and its actions when it comes to ensuring that multinationals pay their fair share of tax within Australia. By not proceeding with similarly sensible measures, as are implemented in this legislation, the Australian people have forgone over a billion dollars in revenue. This is resulting in cuts to essential services. And, as the member for Fraser has noted, every dollar avoided by multinational companies must, in effect, be paid for by Australian taxpayers and businesses, or, of course, by cutting services—essential services maintaining the fabric of our society. We have seen with this budget which side this government is on. It asks those with the least to do the most, time after time after time, as we heard in the matter of public importance discussion only a few minutes ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, I think it is important to acknowledge that cracking down on multinational profit-shifting is not just about making sure that firms pay their fair share of tax, important as that is. Critically, it is also about making sure that the burden of tax is fairly shared across businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am reminded of the comment of the Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr: 'Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society.' That was as prescient of the debate in Australia at the moment, as we argue in this place and outside it about what makes a civilised society. I note the context for that remark. It was made in a dissenting judgement in a 1927 case involving a Spanish tobacco company seeking to minimise its tax arrangements on insurance in the Philippines, then subject to the law of the United States. Even by today's standards—the standards that FATCA is engaged in working through—it was a very complicated case. But His Honour saw through the complex taxation arrangements then, and we must do our best to do likewise now. To quote him more fully: 'It is true … that every exaction of money for an act is a discouragement to the extent of the payment required, but that which, in its immediacy, is a discouragement may be part of an encouragement when seen in its organic connection with the whole.' This notion of an 'organic connection with the whole' is one that deserves some greater consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that this principle is at the very heart of taxation. Taxation should never be seen in isolation, as those opposite and their right-wing cheerleaders insist it should be. It is true, of course, that our roads, schools, hospitals and all of our services are, in large part, funded from tax revenue, but this is part of a broader purpose—that purpose being, of course, to build a society where people are not left behind or excluded because of the material circumstances in which they entered this life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why the coalition's budget has been so devastating, because its basic message is: if you are not born into comfort then you will not get to fully participate in society. And this is why we, on this side, describe the budget as cruel. To say to someone that, no matter how hard you work or how smart you are or how well you apply yourself, you do not stand a chance to get ahead in life because your parents' wealth does not allow for it—this is cruelty. Interestingly, that seemed to be acknowledged to some extent by the former Prime Minister, John Howard, in his contribution at the National Press Club today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Countries that have progressive taxation systems tend to have the least inequality and, in turn, tend to be more collectively prosperous and productive. One only needs to look at the Scandinavian examples as proof of this—evidence, as opposed to neoliberal theory. Can those opposite point to examples of prosperous, productive and equal societies that operate under these sorts of neoliberal regimes? I doubt it, and I again reflect on the contribution of John Howard, a former conservative Prime Minister, in his remarks on the state of the US society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that the US has passed laws to crack down on tax evasion and that Australia is assisting with collection. But it is somewhat ironic that the US is where those opposite look to as a model for Australia, whether it is for universities, health care or gated communities more generally. The US system is in too many respects based on concepts of user-pays exclusivity. It applies a moral lens to those who, for instance, cannot afford to take on massive amounts of debt, who cannot find work or who until recently could not afford health care. It divides their community into haves and have-nots, deserving and undeserving. This has never been the Australian way, and it cannot be so in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I applaud the US administration for getting the high-roller tax evaders to pay their fair share wherever they may be. I note that these measures are permanent, not temporary like this government's deficit tax on high earners. Our government could learn from the US government to treat foreign companies and people the same as it treats Australian companies and people. What is this government doing to tackle Australians seeking to evade taxes here and abroad?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I return once more to Holmes' decision:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The result of upholding the government's action is just. When it taxes domestic insurance it reasonably may endeavor not to let the foreign insurance escape. If it does not discriminate against the latter it naturally does not want to discriminate against its own.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, getting foreign or domestic companies or wealthy individuals to contribute to the running of a society and system of government from which they derive a profit or protection from is entirely just.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And so the principles of this legislation are supported by Labor. But again, it is only part of what is needed to be done. The government wants to repeal Labor's tax transparency reforms. These reforms would have ensured the public could see how much tax Australia's largest companies are paying. They are supporting transparency for US citizens vis-a-vis their tax obligations, but not for large businesses here. If the government are serious about making sure companies pay their fair share of tax, why are they trying to let these same companies hide how much tax they are paying?</span>

                    </a>  The coalition is also not proceeding with Labor's changes to the offshore banking unit regime or the abolition of section 25-90, which allows companies to deduct interest expenses on debt related to foreign untaxed income. According to the government's figures in MYEFO, this will cost Australian taxpayers around $700 million. So while the US is cracking down on people evading tax, the coalition government seems to be doing the exact opposite—indeed, facilitating it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of this debate is a discussion about the revenue-raising capacity of the government and its distribution of this finite resource. Governments all over the world, faced with structurally lower revenue bases, are facing the choice of whether to accept this neoliberal dogma and go down the austerity path of cutting people loose and dividing the haves and the have-nots, or to get those most able to to do their fair share of the heavy lifting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, we do need to have a broader debate about the role of government which, of course, partly manifests itself in this taxation debate. To this extent, the government has started this debate with its neoliberal, extremist budget. For the record, I take this opportunity to say that I believe that there is such a thing as society, and that there is a major role for government in society. Those opposite say that government should get out of the way so that we are left with a dog-eat-dog, survival-of-the-fittest contest that punishes the weak. I believe that government can, indeed must, be a check on the unfettered power of the strong over the weak.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AN0" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CIOBO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  I want to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. The Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the FATCA Agreement) Bill 2014 gives effect to Australia's obligations under the treaty status Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will require Australian financial institutions to collect and provide certain financial account information as specified in the agreement annually to the Australian Taxation Office which, in turn, will provide it to the United States Internal Revenue Service. This will enable Australian financial institutions to comply with the United States Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act in the most cost-effective way possible. In particular, I draw the attention of the House to page 34 of the explanatory memorandum, which details the compliance cost saving this bill will bring about—a saving of more than $583 million over 10 years. The bill will also help to enhance the tax system integrity by providing for improved cooperation between Australia and the United States for the purpose of preventing tax evasion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the amendment that has been moved by the shadow assistant Treasurer, and also take this opportunity to highlight that the government will not support the opposition's amendment. And I note that while there has been a good contribution by government members in relation to this debate, unfortunately, we see another pious amendment that has been moved by the Australian Labor Party in relation to this bill. This time, of course, it is reflecting on the fact that they believe the government should be doing more in relation to multinational tax avoidance. I cannot help but think that once again we see a situation where Labor's narrative in the House sits at strange odds with the general community perception about Labor's economic approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The actual amendment that has been put before the House sits, and dovetails quite nicely, with Labor's ongoing narrative that the way in which—as best as I can tell—Labor intends to pay for their multi tens of billions of dollars of additional spending is to look at being able to recoup additional revenue through the use of the kinds of initiatives that they allude to in this amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And so it is that I consistently hear from Labor members opposite—and we heard it in the contribution of the shadow assistant Treasurer and from the member for Scullin—that Labor's approach in relation to now wanting to put some $38 billion to $40 billion of spending back into the budget is that it will be funded through a crackdown on multinational institutions. The amendment that has been put in relation to this debate goes to the core of Labor's attempt to try to pretend that that is in some way going to provide the revenue that they need to bring about the kind of fiscal consolidation that the government is focused on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately though, the facts simply do not accord, yet again, with Labor's narrative in relation to both those issues—those two issues being multinationals paying tax and the second being their ability to raise enough revenue to make sure that those additional spending initiatives that Labor would like to reintroduce into the budget are actually able to be covered off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen the Labor Party attempt, very poorly, to make changes to transfer-pricing rules in 2012 and 2013. They did it through the Tax Laws Amendment (Cross<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:MS Mincho;&#xD;&#xA;  ">‑</span>Border Transfer Pricing) Act and through the Tax Laws Amendment (Countering Tax Avoidance and Multinational Profit Shifting) Act 2013. It was very clear to the coalition then that the consequence of those acts was going to be that the government was going to massively ramp up compliance costs but not actually get the balance right with respect to ensuring that compliance versus the integrity of the tax system would be in fact balanced. Labor is big on rhetoric when it comes to this matter but their follow-through is, unfortunately, quite poor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition, in contrast, has a proud track record in this sense. We have long supported legislation that counters transfer-pricing, having introduced the original legislation in 1982. In fact, the Treasurer identified addressing base erosion and profit shifting as one of the key issues that G20 finance ministers are focusing on throughout this year. Indeed, in the February meeting of finance ministers in Sydney as part of the G20 process, the Treasurer was able to steer a very good outcome for those G20 members to ensure that there would be strong in-principle agreement. It actually was part of the BEPS process—that is, base erosion profit shifting process—which is taking place throughout this year. There is action by the coalition both in an historical context—having moved the original legislation—and now more recently through our activities in the G20.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the Australian Labor Party a very simple message—that is, the government is actually acting on base erosion and profit shifting. Labor's approach was heavy-handed when it came to red tape and compliance. Labor's approach has failed miserably. Most importantly, not for one second should Australians hold the view that Labor's narrative, their attempt to pump some $38 billion or $40 billion back into the budget, will be covered off by an attempt to try to squeeze more money out of international institutions. The government is alert to failings in this regard. The government is making reforms and, in fact, the coalition is leading international discussions in making sure that the BEPS issue is addressed. It stands in stark contrast to the kind of political games the Australian Labor Party are playing with an amendment such as the one that has been moved by the shadow Assistant Treasurer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fundamentally, the Australian Labor Party needs to recognise that they need to make some hard decisions when it comes to fiscal consolidation and when it comes to putting the budget back on the right track. They cannot mask their decisions by saying, 'Well, we will find the additional revenue for $30 billion or $40 billion of additional spending by magically squeezing more money out of multinational institutions.' No, that is in fact not going to provide anywhere near the kind of revenue the Australian Labor Party is proposing. Rather, what Labor need to do is undertake some of the tough choices about making sure that Australia as a nation and the federal government as an entity live within their means.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I hear contributions like that from the member for Scullin, who made comments that he believed the budget unfairly put too much pressure on pensioners, for example, and on those of lower socioeconomic status, I say to the members opposite, 'Why is it that Australian Labor members profess so much concern for pensioners yet will happily turn a blind eye to the fact that they are lumbering the next generation of Australians with debt that will take decades to repay?' I stand at the dispatch box here and when I look up at the Australian students in the gallery I know that those children are going to be the ones that will be paying off Labor's debt for the next 20 or 30 years. I say to the children of Australia that they are going to be responsible for paying back this government's largess for decades. I say to the Australian Labor Party we do not need lectures about there being an unfair burden on particular elements of the community. Because the reality is that the Australian Labor Party are being grossly hypocritical by making comments like 'it is unfair that this particular group is penalised' meanwhile conveniently ignoring the fact that the very real impact of the past six years of Labor's failed economic approach has been that young Aussie kids are now indebted and will take 20 or 30 years to pay back that debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that is germane to this debate is because the fig leaf that Labor use, trying to explain how they can possibly put forward a proposal to reintroduce $30 billion or $40 billion of spending back in the budget, is to miraculously find the revenue in multinational institutions. I have heard it from the shadow Treasurer. It is not only the shadow Assistant Treasurer who comes up with these pithy little amendments; it is also the actual shadow Treasurer—the alternative Treasurer of the country—who turns around and makes comments such as 'we will find the revenue from multinational institutions who are not paying their fair share'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is important that all Australians recognise that while these kinds of amendments are fun and games for the Australian Labor Party and might tick some kind of factional box for the shadow Assistant Treasurer, the reality is that it will not provide anywhere near the revenue that Labor needs. Labor needs to actually step up to the plate, make some hard decisions and recognise that the populist approach to economics got them into trouble in the first place. It will not get them out of trouble until they have the fiscal discipline to implement the kinds of tough decisions that mean Australia can live within its means. In rejecting the opposition's amendment, I also take this opportunity to commend the bill to the House.</span>

It increases the Medicare levy low-income threshold, the point at which the levy starts to be paid, for families and their dependent children or students, in line with movements in the CPI, commencing in 2013-14. It contains amendments to protect against situations where taxpayers have anticipated the impact of announcements made by the previous government in regard to tax law which have been overturned by the current government and as a result have been left worse off—this is taxpayers who have filed tax returns; lest any listeners think this might have broader applicability. Thirdly it is to introduce an integrity rule to limit the ability of taxpayers to avoid paying tax by dividend-washing, which is a taxation loophole created by the tax treatment of franking credits. </span>

We're also concerned about the co-payment. And I know that Premier Napthine particularly agrees with me that this could see people using ambulances more frequently and also turning up at our emergency departments rather than put their hand in their pocket to go and see a GP.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An editorial in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Medical Journal of Australia</span> this week starkly outlined the view that health professionals have taken about this government's approach to health care. Written by Andrew Wilson, the Director of the Menzies Centre for Health Policy, it says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Chronic disease is a common cause of shortened working life, even when it doesn't kill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The direct effects of the proposed federal Budget on prevention include cuts to funding for the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive health, loss of much of the money previously administered through the now defunct Australian National Preventive Health Agency, and reductions in social media campaigns, for example, on smoking cessation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cuts to preventive health are particularly short-sighted. When bringing down the budget, the Treasurer spoke about the importance of long-term thinking. Yet nothing better epitomises short-termism than cuts to preventive health. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was my pleasure last year on behalf of the Minister for Health to launch the first report of the Australian National Preventive Health Agency. It was a very thoughtful report that looked carefully through the costs and benefits of preventive health treatments, and focused on issues ranging from obesity to road safety, from smoking through to exercise. Yet that agency is being slashed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The editorial in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Medical Journal of Australia</span> by Andrew Wilson is also concerned about the government's proposed $7 co-payment for GP visits:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Other studies confirm that health care visits for preventive activities are the ones most reduced by financial hardship or disincentives. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The editorial goes on to note concern about hospitals:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government's commitment to index its contribution to public hospital costs to population growth and the consumer price index will be insufficient to meet the predicted increase in demand for health care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> Blind Freddy knows that health costs have been running faster than inflation for decades, and so these changes in indexation are going to hit the ability of Australia's healthcare professionals to tackle some of the big healthcare challenges. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a pleasure to have the member for Blair here in the chamber with me. I know he has been a tireless advocate of closing the gap on Indigenous health. Yet, as he has so articulately pointed out, the cuts to health in this budget are going to make it harder to meet the Indigenous targets, to close the gaps in healthcare outcomes. Indeed, these outcomes, as he has pointed out, could be widened. The gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians could be widened by the decisions that are made in this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These decisions are not simply wrong; they are a breach of promise. There is a reason that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health are so keen on trotting out things that I wrote over a decade ago when I was in university, and that is because they do not want to talk about what they said when they were campaigning to be the government of Australia. They were very clear that there would be no cuts to health and education; yet we are seeing more than $80 billion of cuts to health and education as a result of the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to not honouring the National Health Reform Agreement, the Abbott government has cut $368 million out of health by abandoning the National Partnership on Preventive Health and another $201 million by breaking their promise and not honouring the National Partnership Agreement on Improving Public Hospital Services. These cuts are going to lead to the sacking of nurses and doctors, the closure of hospital beds, putting off infrastructure upgrades and sacking frontline healthcare workers like psychiatric nurses and psychologists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is fighting these changes, as are health experts across the country. The Australian Medical Association's national conference has called for an overhaul of the model proposed by the government because of its potential effects on the most vulnerable patients in the community. Steve Hambleton, the outgoing AMA President, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Overseas evidence shows that better health outcomes are delivered when barriers to primary care are low.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Front line primary care services are very efficient and are a low cost part of the Australian health system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Encouraging patients to access this part of the health system reduces pressure on the hospital sector and can avoid the need for more expensive medical interventions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Co-payments can hit vulnerable groups hard.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is particularly striking that both the Prime Minister and I have shifted our view on co-payments since the early 2000s. In 2002 the Prime Minister said that co-payments were 'madcap'. He has since shifted from that view to now be at odds with health experts in Australia. I have shifted my view too, and I am proud to say that I now stand with Australian health experts and organisations like the Australian Medical Association and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Medical Journal of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australia</span>—deeply concerned by the impact that this government's healthcare policies will have on the most vulnerable.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Brian Owler, the Sydney neurosurgeon widely known as the face of the 'Don't Rush' road safety campaign has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If a large proportion of their patients can't afford to pay the co-payment, then those practices might still be bulk-billing, but it will be the GP that bears the cost, and who will be financially worse off … the only way they could do it would be to see more patients. Instead of doing 6-minute medicine, they'll go to 4-minute medicine. That's not something that we want to see happening.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have claimed that they are going to set up a medical research fund but, in fact, as has been pointed out this really is like something out of <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Hollowmen—</span>a fund which is currently funded only by ripping out money from existing funds. Really, it is the trick pulled by Peter Costello with the Future Fund. It is not a serious investment in medical research for the future. This government's healthcare policies will leave Australians sicker and show a lack of concern for the most vulnerable.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  The government came to office determined to restore integrity to the tax system. Our first order of business was to deal with the backlog of 92 announced but unenacted tax measures. This backlog was the source of considerable uncertainty for taxpayers and their advisers.    We moved quickly to announce a position on 28 of those measures and a predisposition not to proceed with the remaining 64 subject to consultation. With the benefit of discussions with the tax profession we then announced a firm decision not to proceed with 48 of those 64 measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this includes measures that some taxpayers would wish we had decided to legislate, at least everyone now knows where they stand—and that is important. In some cases the Commissioner of Taxation announced an administrative approach which permitted taxpayers to reasonably anticipate a change in the law before it occurred, usually where the announced change was expected to operate retrospectively and to be beneficial for taxpayers. In deciding not to implement some announced but unenacted measures, the government also resolved to deal fairly with those taxpayers who had availed themselves of this approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of this bill provides taxpayers who reasonably and in good faith anticipated particular tax law changes from having their tax liability reassessed or adjusted. Importantly, this is a specific accommodation that applies to a discrete list of unenacted measures. It is not a green light for taxpayers to anticipate tax law changes generally either now or in the future, including in respect of those measures the government has announced will proceed. Within the measure there are also safeguards. It will not prevent the Commissioner of Taxation from amending an assessment to give effect to a decision of the AAT or court on review or appeal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 implements one of the measures the government has decided to proceed with, specifically to deny a taxpayer the benefit of franking credits they receive as a result of dividend washing. The measure addresses a loophole and helps to restore integrity to the tax system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Acting swiftly and decisively on announced but unenacted tax measures means that we will be able to embark on the development of a tax white paper without a large backlog hanging over us. That does not mean that we will shy away from making the tough decisions that are needed in the short term to get the government's finances back on a credible path to surplus. We did that with the recent budget. We are getting on with the job of restoring integrity of the tax system. We are getting on with the job of getting Australia's finances back on track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are introducing a three-year temporary levy at a rate of two per cent on individuals with taxable income in excess of $180,000 per annum. This recognises that everyone has to contribute to the task of rebuilding the nation's finances. We are also reintroducing indexation of fuel excise. Clearly, this will have implications for people, particularly those in regional and rural Australia, who travel long distances. We recognise that. But people from rural and regional Australia also understand that if you are going to build roads for the 21st century then you have to pay for them. In difficult fiscal conditions, with borrowings still at record highs, this is a responsible and measured approach to securing additional roads funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over time we want a tax system that rewards hard work, enterprise and entrepreneurial endeavour. We also need a tax system that is simpler and that is more resilient to changes in the way commerce is conducted these days. Thanks to the government's swift and decisive action we can focus on that task without being weighed down by a backlog of measures stretching back more than decade. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="E09" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms OWENS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  I rise to speak on the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2014 Measures No. 2) Bill 2014. I am quite pleased to do so because it gives me an opportunity to talk about a number of things which are either on the government agenda or well and truly included in the budget. The first one is the Medicare levy. This bill ensures that families who were previously exempt from paying the levy will continue to be if their incomes have increased in line with or less than the CPI. As such, it provides more low-income earners with free access to health care and that is a very good thing. It also provides protection for taxpayers who inadvertently failed to realise that there are changes to the tax law. It is a protection provision which gives certainty to taxpayers who are negatively impacted by the unenacted announcements by the previous government, providing that they acted reasonably in anticipating the announcement by previous governments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very good inclusion in the bill because there is, of course, a great deal of uncertainty out there at the moment with the way this government has handled itself. There are of course bills before the Senate now to abolish the loss carry-back provisions as of July last year which still have not passed the House. There are bills that abolish the instant tax write-off for small business as of 1 January this year that are still before the Senate. There is a debt levy coming as well. There is a range of things on their way and there is the abolition of the quarterly R&amp;D credits for small business. So there is a range of things out in the ether generating quite a bit of uncertainty for business. We are likely to see, because of the lack of clarity by the government on a whole range of things, people getting caught in the middle between what they thought was going to happen and what actually does happen. In particular, I would like to talk about the Medicare levy and the changes this government has included in its budget. I want to say first that these changes are incredibly harsh and we all know that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are going to see people in large numbers unable to afford to go to doctors because of the GP tax. I want to point out once again, as I have a number of times in this House, that the pain the government is inflicting on families through this action is not improving the bottom line. The government claims over and over that these are harsh measures. They accept that they are harsh but they say they need to do them because they need to bring the budget back into surplus. Yet, when you look at the figures and at what they are achieving through harsh measures such as the GP tax, they will not bring the budget back into surplus any faster. In fact, the bottom line is slightly worse than it was in the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection yesterday in question time about how PEFO contains the real figures—the figures that the government and the opposition do not have their hands on. If you compare what the government is achieving in its bottom line in this budget compared to PEFO, you see that the deficit will be $5.8 billion worse in 2014-15, which is this budget year, $12.4 billion worse in 2015-16 and $6.4 billion worse in 2016-17. When they come to the dispatch box and talk about these harsh measures being a way to improve the bottom line, we should all remember that, despite all the bluster and all the rhetoric, they have not managed to improve the bottom line at all. Their principal reason for inflicting so much pain through this self-confessed harsh budget is to improve the bottom line, yet they fail to do so by their own accounts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The GP tax is a particularly harsh measure. We know anecdotally from people around the country, from doctors' surgeries and from professional organisations, that we are already seeing people cancel appointments on the basis that they cannot afford to go, even though the GP tax has not yet been introduced. It is a very cruel broken promise. It is designed absolutely as an attack on Medicare. We know that the Liberal conservative government has no love for Medicare. We know that because we have seen over decades how they have behaved when they got to the government benches. In the Whitlam years, we introduced Medibank. It was railed against by the conservative parties of the day and they managed to abolish it during the Fraser years. We introduced Medicare again in the Hawke and Keating years and then in the Howard years we saw the rates of bulk billing decline dramatically to such an extent that in some regional towns in particular you could wait several months to see a bulk-billing doctor. We know that they do not like Medicare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After the Howard years we got back into government and started to work on raising bulk-billing rates again. We succeeded. In fact, in my electorate of Parramatta the bulk-billing rate at the end of 2012-13 was 95.3 per cent and 1,250,000-plus visits to doctors were bulk billed. Were the GP tax imposed on those visits in 2013, my electorate would have lost $9.1 million, which should have gone into my local economy but would have gone directly into the coffers in Canberra. That is an extraordinary amount of money for a community to lose and is an incredible impost on people who are least able to afford it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, in my community we also lost $80 million from the Westmead Hospital local services and a share of $8 million for the Children's Hospital at Westmead and two of my medical research institutes, the Westmead Millennium Institute and the Children's Medical Research Institute, had funding totalling $22 million removed in December last year and $100 million was removed from Westmead Hospital itself. So we have already had substantial cuts to the bottom lines of two of my hospitals and two of my medical research institutes, and now on top of this we are going to see quite a punitive $7 per visit tax, plus a tax on pathology and imaging.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was down at one of my very good local health centres recently, a health centre in Harris Park which has a number of GPs plus specialist services. It is open until 10 o'clock at nights. It is open on public holidays. It works very closely with the local emergency department at Westmead Hospital. Emergency knows when it is open and quite often sends people down to the centre. I was talking to them about the red tape burden of this GP tax and the burden that they are expecting it to have on their patients. They were telling me about the high obesity and diabetes levels in Harris Park. In the neighbouring council of Holroyd, which sits up against Harris Park, the diabetes rate is 10 per cent of the population. Ten per cent of the population in that community have diabetes, and well over 50 per cent are overweight or obese. They were telling me about the regime of some of the more serious diabetes cases, who go to the doctor literally every second day to have bandages changed and have their blood tests when they need them. What an impost this would be on a person that actually had to go to the doctor every two days. What would happen? In fact, they had had some feedback from one of those people, who had said they probably could not afford it. The consequences of not affording it, if you have diabetes at that level, is amputation. It is effectively amputation. We will see people who need to go to the doctor who will not because of this $7 GP tax, and we will see people who think that maybe they need to go to the doctor who will put it off because of this $7 GP tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The irony in all of this—it would be funny if it were not serious—is that cutting support for primary care does not ultimately reduce your health costs. In fact, in the long run it increases them. It is an almost universal truism that what is best for the patient is actually cheaper for the taxpayer. It is cheaper for the taxpayer to immunise than to have whooping cough. It is cheaper for the taxpayer for people to go and have their blood tests and find out about an underactive thyroid or whatever, or diabetes, than let it go for a while. The earlier a person finds out and the earlier the medical intervention, the cheaper it is for the taxpayer and the better it is for the patient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is, of course, best for all of us is a focus on health in the first place, a focus on preventive health and staying healthy. But we have seen this government slash funding to preventive health, abolish the Australian Preventive Health Agency altogether and walk away from the federal responsibility for keeping people healthy. We saw John Howard do that as well. I remember sitting on this side between 2004 and 2007 debating issues of health and hearing the Prime Minister of the day, John Howard, talk about how the federal government does not have responsibility for preventive health. Again, it is an example of a government that considers that its bottom line today is more important than the bottom line of the future or the health of future generations. This is not a government that is prepared to invest now to save costs 10 or 15 years down the track and to save costs for families who ultimately will bear the price of this mistaken policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not the only one. We on this side are not in any way the only ones who are saying that this is a bad idea. We have had people, from doctors and the professional associations, talking about this, saying that this is a bad idea and that it can only lead to people avoiding visits to the doctor that they otherwise should have. In fact, we know from international experience that people will not seek preventive care or follow-up treatment where a GP co-payment is applied. That is exactly the opposite of what we need in this country. The only people advocating for this are the Abbott government and the Commission of Audit. The AMA, the college of emergency physicians, the Doctors Reform Society, the Public Health Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Consumers Health Forum, the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association and countless health academics and economists have advised against this tax, but the government is going to do it anyway. They have advised against this tax for two reasons. It will cause people who should go to the doctor to put it off or not go at all. Ultimately, when that happens, it increases the health cost, not decreases it. I, like so many on this side of the House, urge the government to seriously reconsider this. This is a bad tax that affects the health of our community and affects, ultimately, our health costs down the track. I condemn it. We on this side condemn it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:28</span>):  I will digress in a minute, because we seem to be talking about a lot of things that are not in the Tax and Super Laws Amendment (2014 Measures No. 2) Bill. I will come to those in a minute. An important aspect of this bill is that we are going to increase the Medicare levy low-income threshold for families for the 2013-14 financial year to be in line with movements in the consumer price index. This will ensure that the thresholds keep pace with consumer prices and that low-income families who did not pay the Medicare levy in 2012-13 will continue not to pay it in 2013-14 if their incomes have increased in line with or by less than the CPI. This is very important because, as you know, if you do not index those types of thresholds, with bracket creep you can start to get people who are affected by that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The low-income threshold for couples and families will increase by $674 to $34,367, and the phase-in threshold will increase by $793 to $40,431. The amount added for each dependent child will also increase by $62 to $3,156. This will put money back into the wallets of low-income earners. And, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance noted earlier in this debate, this bill is also about restoring integrity—and, might I add, certainty—to the Australian tax system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to digress, though: the other side have been speaking a lot about things that are not even in this bill. Can I just comment on the Medicare co-payment and talk about what that is going to fund. That is going to fund the Australian Medical Research Future Fund. Earlier speakers on the other side were talking about things like preventative health and other issues. This fund will do more for preventative health and do more for the prevention of disease than anything that the history of this country has ever seen. On this side of the chamber, we are builders. We build things. We are about making this country better, stronger and, in this context, more healthy. We want this fund to be a world leader in medical research. How exciting is that for every citizen of this country?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the member for Fraser talk earlier about how it is a trick. I think that is what he said. I think his words were that it is a trick like the Future Fund, which Peter Costello started. Well, if it is anywhere near as successful as the Future Fund, bring it on. The Future Fund, as we know, was—again—this side of politics building something. It was this side of politics looking into the future and wanting things to be sustainable. We saw that we had public servants who were going to retire, and there was nothing put away for the obligations that the government had for their superannuation, so that fund was started by this side of politics because we ran a responsible budget. We put $50 billion into it, and over the last six or seven years that has grown—I am not sure of the exact number—to be about double what it was. So there we have now a $100 billion fund which is sitting there because we built it, which has every public servant's superannuation obligation funded. That is what the medical research fund is like. If the medical research fund is nearly as successful in getting results for preventing disease and for improving the health of this country, that will be absolutely fantastic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance also noted, we were elected, and we were confronted with a backlog of 92 announced but not enacted tax and superannuation measures, one of them dating back as far as March 2001. Again I come back to the point of sustainability. The one thing that tax systems have to have is certainty so that the investing public and businesses know what is in the tax system and there are not any surprises there. The tax system—unfortunately, as some people may think—has to be not only certain but competitive. I know that you know this, Mr Deputy Speaker Kelly. You have a business background. You have business experience, and you know that companies now can move. Companies are not always confined by geography. There have been examples where countries have lowered the corporate tax rate and—guess what?—they have collected more money. So our tax system not only has to be about certainty, which this bill certainly is, but also has to be competitive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The backlog that this bill is dealing with had created considerable uncertainty for many taxpayers in the business community. The government has taken decisive action to resolve this backlog. We quickly moved to announce our support for 28 of these measures and a disposition not to proceed with the remaining 64, subject to consultation. We do not make decisions like those the member for Wentworth continually tells us about—decisions about NBN on the back of beer coasters—or irresponsibly. We make decisions because we consult. We go to people in the real world, in the real business world or the real tax world. We go through; we analyse it, and we make responsible and—dare I say it—adult decisions. That is what this bill is about with these tax measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the discussions that we had with the community, we said we would not proceed with 48 of those measures. However, in deciding not to go ahead, the government had to resolve how to deal with those taxpayers who had, in good faith, anticipated these changes before they were enacted. So again, as adults, being responsible, we said that because they had acted in good faith it was incumbent upon us also to act in good faith, and those protections would be measures in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The protection provision will protect and provide ongoing certainty for taxpayers who have self-assessed on the basis of the particular announced taxation measures that the government has decided not to proceed with. The commissioner's usual amendment and recovery powers apply in circumstances where the conditions for protection are not met. The measure does not apply more generally to measures that are not listed or to those that may not proceed as a result of future decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third aspect is related to dividend washing. Every sector of the economy and every sector of our world certainly has its own language, and 'dividend washing' is obviously very specific to the finance world. A lot of people get very confused about it. This is also referred to as 'distribution washing'. It allows an entity basically—Mr Deputy Speaker Kelly, you may well understand this and have dealt with this—to obtain multiple franking credit entitlements in respect of a single underlying shareholding. Common sense tells you that that should not happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To dividend wash, an entity sells shares shortly after becoming entitled to receive the franked dividend in respect of those shares, then shortly afterwards the entity purchases a new and substantially identical set of shares that also provides an entitlement to another fully franked dividend. This dividend washing enables sophisticated shareholders to effectively trade their franking credits to each other, with some shareholders receiving two sets of franking credits for the same parcel of shares. This practice can allow foreign shareholders who cannot use franking credits to sell their franking credits to domestic investors who can use them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure amends the tax law to deny the benefits of any additional franking credits received as a result of dividend washing. The measure is targeted at sophisticated taxpayers who are exploiting a loophole in the existing provisions. Investors operating within the intent of the existing law will not have anything to worry about. Since this measure was announced, dividend washing already has been significantly curtailed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a tax bill. As a country we need certainty in our tax laws and we need our tax laws to be competitive. As a government we look at the two sides of the equation: one side is spending; the other side is income, which is tax collection. What the budget and this bill are about, as we say in this chamber every day, is for our spending to be sustainable. For people who rely on the age pension, on the public health system, on the public education system or on any other welfare spending of this government, we want that to be sustainable. And for that to be sustainable the spending has to be responsible. On the tax side of the equation, that has to be competitive and certain. When you get both of those right, people can live in a system and know that they have comfort.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, a lot of governments and a lot of countries around the world do not get this right. It is very easy for a politician when they are in government—dare I point over there, Mr Deputy Speaker—to walk around throwing money around. That is very easy and it is lovely—there is nothing like walking into a group of people and splashing some money around because you might well feel like a hero. When politicians do that too often—there are many countries in Europe, and I would put the United States in the same category, where politicians do too much of that—without being responsible, they get themselves into trouble.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a country we had the best set of books. Six years ago, when the coalition left government, we left this country with the best books in the world. We had a $20 billion surplus in the last year we were in government and we had put $50 billion aside into the Future Fund. We had a great set of figures. We were able to fund the welfare programs, health and infrastructure with certainty because we were being responsible. In six years we went from having the best set of figures in the Western world to having the fastest-growing debt of any country in the Western world. The result, in just that short space of time, is that we are now spending $1 billion a month in interest. That rolls off the tongue too easily, but that is $12 billion a year. What could we spend that on? One of the biggest infrastructure projects in my electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Kelly, is also a major infrastructure project in the country: the duplication of the Pacific Highway. Do you know how much it is to do that? Do you know how much federal money is going into that? It is $5 billion to $6 billion. It has been a massive infrastructure project that is taking us decades to build and $5 billion or $6 billion worth is left to do. That is a lot of money. That is half of our interest bill in one year. The sad thing about that, Mr Deputy Speaker—and you know this because you have been a businessman—is that we will have that interest bill again, next month, next year. We have not repaid the debt; that is just the interest on the debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill with its taxation measures are about certainty. They are about businesses being able to function in this economy efficiently, effectively and with certainty so that as a government we can fund the essential services like health, education and welfare, as we should. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr JENSEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  Today I am pleased to rise in support of the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2014 Measures No. 2) Bill 2014. This bill has been brought on to address three matters. One is to increase the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for families in line with increases in CPI. These changes ensure that Australians who did not pay the Medicare levy in 2012-13 will continue to be exempt if their incomes have risen in line with or by less than CPI. The second is to introduce measures to protect taxpayers who have self-assessed on the basis of particular announced taxation measures that the government has decided not to proceed with. The third is to improve the fairness of the taxation system by amending tax law to deny an entity the benefits of any additional franking credits that an entity receives as a result of a known process known as distribution washing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 13 May the Treasurer passed down the coalition's first budget. It was a tough budget but it was fair budget. At the heart of the budget was the notion to restore integrity to Australia's finances. We delivered a budget of both saving and building. It is a budget that ensures that we will get back to living within our means, just like households must do. In delivering the budget the coalition ensures that the effort to restore the mess left by six years of Labor chaos and calamity is shared amongst all Australians, while at the same time ensuring that it is done in a fair and equitable manner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes under schedule 1 build on this notion by ensuring those Australians who did not pay the Medicare levy in 2012-13 are not unfairly affected by having the Medicare levy imposed on them if their income has risen in line with or by less than CPI. This measure leaves more money in the pockets of affected families, money that will make the day-to-day costs of living easier. It is an important measure because last year I and the Liberal Party campaigned on a platform of easing cost-of-living pressures for families. This is one such measure that will support that promise. The coalition is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. The Minister for Health has already spoken to the challenges Australia's health system faces and I commend Minister Dutton's recent speech to CEDA to anyone who is interested in the reasons for reform in this area. In short, the coalition is making the tough decisions to ensure the health of our system is sustainable into the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a disappointment that those opposite and their brethren in the other place would block the coalition's plan to fix Labor's mess. Their publicly stated aversion to passing around $18 billion worth of announced reforms to health, education and welfare is without foundation. Nor do those opposite respect our mandate to repeal the carbon tax and the mining tax, which would further ease pressures on the household budget. As has been restated many times in this place, scrapping the carbon tax will save households up to $550 annually. Schedule 2 of the bill, importantly, puts in place measures that bring to light the inefficiency of the dark Labor Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Soon after the government was elected we were advised that 96 tax and superannuation announcements, with one dating back as far as March 2001, had not been legislated. In November the Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer announced that the coalition would finally deal with the backlog of announced but unlegislated tax and superannuation measures. This backlog created a significant operational uncertainty for businesses and consumers. Labor never did or never will appreciate the real-world consequences of stalled decisions on business. They never understood the impact of the delays and indecision and they still operate in a policy myopia bereft of any understanding of the importance on acting upon announcements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 exists because of Labor's failure to deal with 96 tax and superannuation announcements before the change of government. These were measures that were announced and shelved to gather dust, because they were too busy concentrating on infighting and not on the important job of running the country—infighting and dysfunction that led to the fastest spending growth and the third largest increase in net debt in the OECD. It is a burden that those on the other side deny and are happy to wash their hands of, instead choosing to foist the responsibility for the decisions they made upon the next generation. This legacy is costing Australia $1 billion per month in interest payments or $500 annually for every man, woman and child in Australia. This is money that could be directed at hospitals, improved roads or schools. What is sad about the need to repay this money is that it is not being captured within the Australian financial sector. This is good money that is being sent overseas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What were some of those 96 measures that were ignored or too uncomfortable for Labor to deal with? There was the famed self-education expenses cap, a proposal that would put a cap of $2,000 on the amount people could deduct for self-education expenses. At the time, the world's best Treasurer said that this was to target people who made large claims for first-class airfares, five-star accommodation and expensive courses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately for the member for Lilley, the reality could not be further from the truth. It does not take much to scratch the surface and discover that 80 per cent of the people who claimed this benefit are earning less than $80,000 annually. I was pleased that the coalition, sensibly, did not proceed with this measure. People on this side of the chamber will recall Labor's grand plan to close down the car-leasing industry with their proposed changes to the fringe benefits tax laws. These changes would make it harder for people to have a company or salary-sacrificed vehicle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This $1.8 billion hit would have, according to the Australian Salary Packaging Industry Association, affected roughly 500,000 employees. Approximately 70 per cent of these people are on a salary that is less than $100,000 per annum—everyday Australians whose employers wanted to provide an additional benefit to their salary package and be more competitive in the marketplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> Because the coalition understands business and does the hard yards to understand the real-world impact on people's hip pockets, we scrapped this misguided tax. It was a commitment we took to the election and one that we honoured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As promised by the Treasurer, today we are honouring our commitment to the Australian people. Today we are ensuring that those people who self-assessed their taxation in good faith that Labor would stick to their word and implement the measures they announced while in government will not be penalised. The changes in this bill are retrospective acknowledgement that people made decisions on the little trust that they had left in Labor, believing they could deliver on their promise, only to be bitterly disappointed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud of our government's ability to hit the ground running and make decisive decisions that were holding business to ransom, decisions that deal with the ineffectiveness of those members opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At heart, I believe in ensuring that we have a fair tax system and our amendments to schedule 3 of this bill are another step towards ensuring equity is maintained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those in a position to take advantage of the share market should adhere to the spirit of the rules governing the purchase and selling of stocks. Currently, sophisticated investors can undertake a practice known as 'distribution washing'. This occurs when an entity sells an interest shortly after becoming entitled to receive a fully-franked distribution in respect of that interest and then, shortly after, purchases a new and substantially identical interest that also provides a second entitlement to another fully-franked distribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The imputation system contains integrity rules to ensure that franking credits benefit only the true economic owners of shares and to ensure that franking credits are only available to shareholders in proportion to their shareholdings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As was highlighted by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, distribution washing contravenes both these principles. By closing this loophole we are ensuring that the tax system remains fairer for all. We are ensuring that those who have the capacity to take advantage of the share market are doing so in a way that does not give them an unfair advantage. This measure will raise $60 million, money that can be reinvested in health, education and building the roads of the 21st century. Already, since the announcement of the policy, there has been a significant decrease in activity that could be perceived as distribution washing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this affects a small portion of the market, it is important to note that trading activity has continued to grow. The coalition went to the election promising the Australian people that we would fix the budget. We promised to create jobs and we promised to break the cycle of debt and deficit that had been placed upon the Australian people. We made these promises because getting the economic fundamentals right is in the Liberal Party's DNA. Today the ABS announced that Australia's gross domestic product grew 1.1 per cent in the first three months of the year to bring Australia's annual growth rate to 3.5 per cent over the 12 months to March. This means on an annualised basis Australia's economy is now growing more quickly than the US, UK or New Zealand. In the words of the Treasurer, we can be cautiously optimistic that our plan is working. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Carl Sagan once stated, 'You have to know the past to understand the present.' When the coalition left office in 2007 Australia had $20 billion in surplus and $50 billion in the bank. Australia is in the position that we are today because of the decisions Labor made over the last six years: decisions like the pink batts scheme, concocted and costed in two days with little or no consultation. Those two fateful days left a dark legacy and the stain upon the nation with the death of four good citizens and an economic cost of more than $2.8 billion. Decisions like the $16 billion BER for the construction of Gillard memorial halls that were overpriced and in some cases not even fit for purpose. Decisions like the gold-plated fibre-to-the-home NBN, which was conceived between Prime Minister Rudd and communications minister Stephen Conroy in a plane with an initial public investment of $4.7 billion. But, as was shown upon the review last year, it ballooned out to more than $73 billion and would have missed its completion date by three years. Decisions like the economic stimulus package which sent $900 cheques to around 27,000 Australians living overseas and 21,000 dead people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is committed to ensuring sensible measures are put in place to address those failings, wrongs that left a Labor legacy of 200,000 more unemployed people, gross debt that without action was projected to rise to $667 billion, $123 billion in cumulative deficits, more than 50,000 illegal arrivals by boat, the world's biggest carbon tax and $191 billion in unfunded spending measures. It is now time for Australia to start repaying the credit card. Since coming to government we have taken practical steps to give Australia the bright future it deserves. The Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2014 Measures No. 2) Bill 2014 is another step on the road to recovery. I commend the bill to the House. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  This is an opportunity to commend Australia's tax and transfer system and in particular shine a light on schedule 1 of this bill, which makes changes to the Medicare low-income threshold. With your indulgence, Deputy Speaker, I will focus specifically on the schedule that has not been addressed in the debate so far: changes to the low-income threshold which make a significant change for people living with incomes in the range of $20,000 to $35,000. I mention it because it is almost an untold story in the budget and many of us look with a certain bemusement at left-wing journalists who attempted to make broad assumptions about how people would be worse off in the 2014-15 budget when in reality they were unable to incorporate some of these very positive changes around safety nets that gave low-income Australians a real chance of being able to both afford the health system we are in at the moment but also weather periods when there are significant out-of-pocket costs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every health system in the world grapples with this simple fact that there are some people with chronic, complex and expensive health needs but there are also people who experience individual years of very high out-of-pocket health costs. Australia has quite an elegant way of dealing with it through safety nets introduced under the Howard government. I guess one of my concerns is that the level of understanding of these safety nets is quite poor. When you speak to people who are potentially eligible for the safety nets, many have not registered with the Department of Human Services to be eligible. Many are not tracing their use of general practice, optometric and other Medicare eligible out-of-hospital services to know that they are hitting the safety net at all. This is a very important piece of information not just because they exist but because in this budget we work to strengthen those thresholds for low-income earners and it appears in this legislation under schedule 1. I want to emphasise that now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stepping back in context, Australia has the most finely balanced, exquisitely balanced, health system on the planet with about half our population having access to private health insurance and half using a very high-quality public system. We achieved that balance not by accident. We achieved it by a coalition committed to getting there. We got there through health minister Dr Michael Wooldridge and his three-pillared approach to building confidence in private health care: the 30 per cent rebate that has been the subject of considerable detrimental tweaking by the previous Labor government; the Medicare levy surcharge, where if you do not take out private health insurance you pay an additional Medicare levy of between one and 1.5 per cent; and, finally, community rating, which works to ensure that, regardless of your health and age, you can enter and contemplate private health insurance even if you live in Rockhampton without having to be concerned about paying more. While there are obviously elements of adverse selection avoided, some people do criticise that system because of the moral hazard around potentially engaging in unhealthy behaviour but still paying the same price for your private health insurance. That is one for another day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back to the Medicare levy, the surcharge for high-income earners who do not take up private health insurance is probably the most powerful of those three. It is a piece of policy unique to Australia, which was the first to adopt it in the late 1990s. Once again it is one of those elements of coalition social policy that has been looked at, examined and adopted in other parts of the world. The Medicare levy surcharge was in place mostly as a way to get more people to take out private health insurance, but let us make one thing clear: the Medicare levy does not pay for the Medicare system. The entire Medicare levy component, as discussed in schedule 1 of this bill, is only about 15 per cent of the total Medicare bill, so it is a contribution but in no way covers it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At these levy calculations which change as a result of this budget and this bill, we know that at lower incomes people who are not paying tax into the system are not actually triggered to pay the Medicare levy. That makes perfect sense, doesn't it. What happened in this budget was that these thresholds were increased even more than CPI. That has important implications for some people who are living in those income ranges. If you are below the threshold, and that is $20,542, there is no Medicare levy payable. Between about $20,000 and $24,000, you are paying for 10 per cent of any of your excess above the $20,000 figure. But once you hit that $24,168 then the entire taxable amount is subject to a Medicare levy surcharge. These are reasonable as are the pensioner tax offset concessions, which ensure that if you are receiving a full pension the same thresholds are not triggered and you do not start paying a Medicare levy. For every reason this is good policy because there is no point having a tax churn down in the group or pulling into a tax system simply to pay a levy. That makes good sense. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is important are the changes that we have made to the Medicare safety net. We have seen reductions, significantly, to $400 for singles and families, $700 for those who receive family tax benefit part A and $1,000 for others. People do not even know that these safety nets exist in many cases, and they need to. They need to know that the coalition has worked to ensure that families who are living in various parts of Australia can now still come under the one family safety net. That is an important piece of policy that makes our health system even more affordable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last important piece of policy intervention was to cap the amount relative to the scheduled fee that can be charged from an out of pocket, and that would be to prevent gouging in instances of very high medical bills that depart significantly from the Medicare scheduled fee. That makes sense and it avoids that gaming situation where a medical practitioner may say, 'You've already hit the safety net for the year so all of this will be paid for by the government, so please don't feel bad about this particularly large bill.' That gets addressed as well. People need to know when they hit the $400, $700 and $1,000, these simplified, much lower and much stronger safety nets are now in place thanks to the Abbott government. The Howard government was responsible for these safety nets. The Abbott government has strengthened them and schedule 1 of this bill works in a complementary way to ensure that people who are not paying tax are not hit by the Medicare levy.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  I thank those members who have contributed to this debate. Schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the FATCA Agreement) Bill 2014 amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the Medicare levy low-income thresholds in line with the consumer price index.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The families' threshold will increase from $33,693 to $34,367 and the threshold for each dependent child will also increase from $3,094 to $3,156. The amendments to the Medicare levy low-income thresholds apply to the 2013-14 year of income and future income years. The Medicare levy low-income thresholds for individuals and pensioners have already been increased by more than the growth in the consumer price index between 2011-12 and 2013-14. Full detail of this measure is contained in the explanatory memorandum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of this bill introduces an important measure to protect taxpayers who have self-assessed on the basis of particular announced taxation measures the government has decided not to proceed with. This protection measure arises from this government's decisive action to restore integrity to the taxation system by clearing the large backlog of announced but unenacted measures left by the previous government. This backlog created considerable uncertainty for affected taxpayers and their advisers. The protection provision will provide ongoing certainty for taxpayers that were impacted by an unenacted announcement for which protection is provided. Full detail of this measure is contained in the explanatory memorandum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of this bill amends the tax law to deny an entity the benefits of any additional franking credits that an entity receives as a result of distribution washing. To distribution wash, an entity sells an interest shortly after becoming entitled to receive a fully franked distribution in respect of that interest, then shortly after purchases a new and substantially identical interest that also provides a second entitlement to another fully franked distribution. The imputation system contains integrity rules to ensure franking credits only benefit the true economic owners of shares and to ensure franking credits are only available to shareholders in proportion to their shareholdings. Distribution washing contravenes both these principles by enabling sophisticated shareholders to effectively trade their franking credits and by enabling some shareholders to receive two sets of franking credits for effectively the same parcel of shares. It effectively allows foreign shareholders who cannot use franking credits to sell their franking credits to domestic investors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the announcement of this policy, there has been a significant decrease in activity that could be perceived as distribution washing. Of course, this only affects a small portion of the market. Overall trading activity has continued to grow, with the value of trading increasing by five per cent since this policy was announced. Addressing distribution washing by closing the loopholes will support investment by improving the efficiency and integrity of the tax system. It will also help ensure the long-term sustainability of the imputation system for all Australians. Full detail of this measure is contained in the explanatory memorandum.</span>

                    </a>  I hear the shadow Assistant Treasurer say it is groundhog day. We continue to see silly amendments being put forward by the opposition, but it is entirely consistent with the silly approach Labor adopted to economic policy in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note in the amendment that the Labor Party attempts in some way, shape or form to make reference to the government's co-payment by referencing, to use the words of opposition, 'the government's attack on universal health care through its introduction of the GP tax'. The extraordinary thing about this is that the shadow Assistant Treasurer, the person who has moved the second reading amendment, is indeed the one person who it would appear at first blush on the opposition benches is least able to move this amendment. I wonder whether the actual reason this amendment has been moved by the shadow Assistant Treasurer has less to do with a belief in policy or more to do with an attempt by the shadow Assistant Treasurer to earn some stripes with respect to his credibility amongst his Labor brethren.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, the fact that the shadow Assistant Treasurer would attempt to, in some way, insinuate that a co-payment for a GP consultation is not an appropriate policy tool is slightly strange, given that the shadow Assistant Treasurer has put forward his strong support for a Medicare co-payment in the past. In fact, in 2003, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span>, the shadow Assistant Treasurer wrote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As economists have shown, the ideal model involves a small co-payment—not enough to put a dent in your weekly budget, but enough to make you think twice before you call the doc. And the idea is hardly radical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the heart of the problem is that in health care, as with other goods and services, free provision leads to overconsumption.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So you can understand, I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, my slight bemusement at the amendment that has been moved by the shadow Assistant Treasurer, and you can understand the reason that not only I and other members of the coalition but also, no doubt, members of the public wonder about the true rationale for the amendment that has been moved by the shadow Assistant Treasurer—because clearly, given the shadow Assistant Treasurer's academic background in economics, and given the writings that I have just quoted from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span>, which the shadow Assistant Treasurer provided, I assume, as an op-ed, you can understand that the shadow Assistant Treasurer is in fact a devotee of a co-payment when it comes to medical consultations.</span>

                    </a>  I will certainly do so, Mr Deputy Speaker. So let me be quite particular with the words I use. It is very clear that the shadow Assistant Treasurer held the view that it is not radical for there to be a co-payment with respect to medical consultations, and, furthermore, that the fundamental problem with the so-called free provision of a service is that it leads to overconsumption. I have no doubt that the aspirational side of the shadow Assistant Treasurer means that he has now got to walk away from his economics background, and he has now got to walk away from his true belief.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that goes to the very core of the point I make, which is that there is, understandably, a clear understanding on this side of the House, and among the general public, that this amendment has been moved for the very same reason that the shadow Assistant Treasurer jumped to his feet just now, and indeed the exact same reason that the shadow Assistant Treasurer offered a personal explanation, and indeed the same reason why the shadow Assistant Treasurer has walked away from his belief that a co-payment is good policy—for one reason and one reason alone, and that is that the shadow Assistant Treasurer wants to make sure that he is in lock-step with Labor Party policy. And so—</span>

                    </a>  I take that on board, Mr Deputy Speaker. But it is self-evident to anybody who has been listening to this debate—and not only to this particular debate but to the general debate around a co-payment—to understand the rationale for the decision of the shadow Assistant Treasurer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is that we see the Labor Party walk away from good policy. We see the Labor Party walk away from good economic policy, from good social policy and from an appropriate initiative taken to attempt, in some way, to make sure that Australia lives within its means with respect to the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the fundamental problem with the amendment that has been moved by the shadow Assistant Treasurer is that Labor is not proposing—either through this amendment or in the discussion that they have been having through the media and with the general community—to put forward any alternative plan for how Labor would fund the policy approach that Labor believes this country should be taking. It is one thing to be as populist as possible. In fact, it is understandable that an opposition, having been comprehensively rejected by the Australian public, would take the view that they need to do all that they can to attempt to appeal to the masses, so to speak, in their policies. But it is a separate thing for an educated individual like the shadow Assistant Treasurer to walk away from sound policy, to walk away from an approach that he himself was a fierce advocate for, for many years—a position which he took the decision to walk away from only in the last several days, knowing full well that it was done to benefit him politically. So the question that the constituents of Fraser can ask themselves legitimately, and the question that the constituents of Fraser can ask legitimately of their federal member, is: how many other matters of principle is he prepared to walk away from in pursuit of his political career? That is the fundamental question that the electors of Fraser can ask. How many other matters of principle is their elected representative willing to walk away from in pursuit of his ambition? Because it is crystal clear that he is prepared to walk away from this matter—something that he has believed in, obviously, for more than a decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the approach of the member for Fraser—that is, the approach to reject sound policy in pursuit of short-term populism—is entirely consistent with the broader approach of the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party's approach with respect to this amendment and, more broadly, economic policy, is to reject any adherence to sound policy and to embrace a short-term, knee-jerk reaction in the hope that they can in some way build some political credibility off the back of some of the short-term concern that elements of the community express with respect to the budget initiatives that were announced.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have said on numerous occasions, and the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and others have said on numerous occasions, that we understand that this budget and the initiatives within the budget are not popular in all strata of society, and we understand that there are elements in the community that dislike some of the initiatives. But the fundamental, inescapable fact is that these decisions are a consequence of six years of reckless spending, of six years of poor economic management and of six years of a failed economic approach that meant the pathway this nation was on, where we were borrowing a billion dollars a month just to service the interest on the debt that Labor had accumulated, was unsustainable. But for the fact that Labor had racked up so much debt and so much deficit in such a relatively short period of time, these kinds of decisions would not be necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If Australia were as healthy today in an economic sense as it was when the Australian Labor Party was first elected back in 2007, these types of choices would not necessarily have to be made. But now, faced with a crippling debt burden and faced with a prognosis from the independent Parliamentary Budget Office that indicates that unless structural change is made now, Australia will not be able to respond in the future, this government has done the right thing and taken the decisions that needed to be taken in order to live within our means. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But unfortunately, the government's commitment to protecting our natural environment does not extend much further than tokenistic gestures. The government simply has no credibility when it comes to the environment. In fact, the member for Batman beside me will sometimes interject when the Minister for the Environment jumps to his feet: 'He's not the Minister for the Environment! He's the Minister against the Environment!' A government that lacks a minister for science effectively lacks a minister for the environment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why Australia is moving backwards on its reputation for protecting World Heritage icons: the government have disallowed the endangered community listing of the River Murray from the Darling to the sea. They have—against all reason, all advice and sneakily—had the world's largest marine reserve system re-proclaimed to undo the management plans to give them effect. They have begun the process of handing over environmental approval powers to the states, to give Campbell Newman control over the Great Barrier Reef and Colin Barnett control over Ningaloo Reef. But worst of all, the government is moving backwards on climate change—moving from sound science and economic based approaches to approaches that will cost more and do less.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The key point of a carbon price is that it internalises the externalities—a terrific philosophy and, indeed, a philosophy that I see when I turned to the explanatory statements behind this bill on the Department of the Environment's website. On that site I see:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The levy offsets the costs of benefits paid to oil recyclers as an incentive to undertake increased recycling of used oil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This ensures that some of the costs of used oil recycling are borne by the markets that gain the benefits from the production and use of that oil rather than from public moneys and other markets. In economic terms, it internalises the externalities—a terrific idea. If only this government could do it not only for oils but also for carbon pollution. We know that Australia has a carbon price which is working well. It is not an economy-wide carbon price as some of those opposite would have you believe. It covers about 60 per cent of domestic emissions, excluding largely agriculture and transport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the electricity sector, the industry most directly covered by the carbon price, has seen its emissions fall 7.6 per cent, 14.8 million tonnes, in the first year of the carbon price. So let no-one tell this House that the carbon price is not working already. And so much for $100 roasts and Whyalla being wiped off the map. We have seen strong economic activity in the period since the carbon price was put in place. There are challenges to consumer confidence and retail sales at the moment. But, in the immediate period after the introduction of the carbon price, there was no evidence that it was going to lead to the economic Armageddon that those in the coalition were suggesting. It is particularly ironic that we have a Treasurer who says in his post-budget speech:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet this desire for dealing with deficits has not extended to, for example, reducing the deficit, because compared to PEFO, as the member for Cook yesterday pointed out, the government has increased the deficit—this year, next year and over the forward estimates. But if you are focused on intergenerational equity, why on earth would you kick the can down the road on climate change? Why would you eschew a measure which, in economic terms, internalises the externalities? It is good enough for oils; it should be good enough for tackling climate change.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Standing beside President Obama, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Gina McCarthy, said recently:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is 'not just about disappearing polar bears or melting ice caps. This is about protecting our health and our homes. This is about protecting local economies and this is about protecting jobs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that is exactly what a carbon pricing scheme does. It ensures that we get least-cost abatement and are therefore able to keep up with the rest of the world, which is moving significantly faster than us on climate change.  We know now the United States is aiming for 17 per cent emissions by 2020. Australia will struggle to hit the five per cent emissions reduction target.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How are the United States doing it? Those opposite will have you believe that the United States are purely committed to direct action; that President Obama loves nothing more than direct action. But of course President Obama's first option for dealing with climate change was to take a cap and trade bill, co-sponsored by John McCain, to the congress. That was killed off. Some of the more extreme elements of the Republican Party killed off his ideal cap and trade scheme. President Obama is now going to 'pivot', as he puts it, to a cleaner energy future via strict limits on carbon emissions from power generators and through cap and trade schemes that will place a commercial price on carbon permits.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was precisely what Labor did in government in introducing the carbon price. We put in place a scheme which increased the taxes on pollution and lowered the tax on work, because we wanted more opportunities for people to work but less carbon pollution and that is exactly the outcome we saw. The OECD Secretary-General has acknowledged, as the explanatory memorandum to this bills does, that in economic terms you want to 'internalise the externalities'.</span>

The Prime Minister, as the member for Wentworth has noted, has been a weathervane on climate change, has held every possible position on climate change. He supported what he called a carbon tax—'why don't we just deal with it with a simple tax'—not while he was at university but while he was a member of this House. Flipping again—the weathervane that he is—he said on 27 July 2009 on the 7<span style="font-style:italic;">:30 Report</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be news to the Prime Minister that 13 of the 14 hottest years on record have occurred since the year 2000. Australia has just had its hottest year on record. We have had the hottest winter on record. We have had the hottest summer on record and we have just seen record hot spells across Australia. So the climate deniers have the lie put to them by the Bureau of Meteorology.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are members of this House who think the Bureau of Meteorology is part of a great big conspiracy with NASA, CSIRO and some of those other wicked folks that have dreamed up climate science. But to serious public policy players, this is a serious problem that demands a solution. What kind of solution? A solution that, in economic terms, 'internalises the externalities'. What solution is this government proposing? They are proposing a $40 billion slope. According to modelling by the Climate Institute, the Emissions Reduction Fund, if it is to do the job of just getting a five per cent emissions reduction target, would need to spend $40 billion by 2020. If the government spends less than that then, as a consequence, they will not even hit that five per cent emissions reduction target. So we will undershoot five per cent while the US gets 17 per cent.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do experts think when they look at the government's Direct Action Plan? A survey by Fairfax's Matt Wade and Gareth Hutchens found that 33 out of 35 economists rejected the government's Direct Action policy. Internationally renowned economist Justin Wolfers of the Brookings Institution at the University of Michigan—I should disclose that Justin is a friend of mine—said that he was surprised that any economist would opt for Direct Action. BT Financial's Chris Caton said any economist who did not opt for emissions trading 'should hand his degree back'. When confronted with this sort of evidence in a survey of the Economic Society of Australia, Mr Abbott, in 2011, said: 'Maybe that's a comment on the quality of our economists rather than on the merits of argument.' The Prime Minister has never seen an expert that he did not want to trash-talk. He has never seen an expert committee he did not want to shut down. </span>

You do not have to go back to 2003; no, you have to go back a long way before that. In order to get to the member for Flinders' thesis, you have to go back to 1990. Greg Hunt's thesis was titled <span style="font-style:italic;">A tax to make polluters pay: the application of pollution taxes within the Australian legal system</span>. It argued that: 'A pollution tax is both desirable and, in some form, inevitable.' It noted that 'even if some Liberal's'—and he got the apostrophe wrong but let's not worry about that—'constituents do respond negatively, a pollution tax does need to be introduced to properly serve the public interest.' It goes on to say: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the member for Flinders in 1990, making the same point that the explanatory memorandum makes. Let me quote from the explanatory memorandum again: 'In economic terms, it internalises the externalities.' If it's good enough for oil, it should be good enough for carbon pollution.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alas, the member for Flinders has moved away from that position. He moved away from it surprisingly quickly. The parliamentary secretary was impugning my motives for shifting my view on a GP co-payment; I now take the view held by the Australian Medical Association and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Medical Journal of Australia</span>. But the member for Flinders cannot find a single serious economist to back Direct Action. What was the point at which he changed—or, dare I say it, the tipping point? Of course it was the one-vote change in the Liberal Party room, from Malcolm Turnbull to Tony Abbott as leader of the Liberal Party.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are now climate deniers run rampant. We have the Liberal member for Dawson, George Christensen, saying that 'a number' of Liberals disagree that climate change is real. The Prime Minister's chief business adviser, Maurice Newman, disagrees with 97 per cent of the world's scientists—apparently Mr Newman is a better judge of science than 97 per cent of the world's scientists—and he thinks there is no evidence of man-made climate change or of any climate change at all.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Direct Action is a policy that pays polluters to pollute, which is more expensive and which will not do the job. We still do not have details about the policy. As the shadow minister for the environment has pointed out, we do not have the fundamental details of a policy which the coalition took to the last election. We do not know the penalties that would apply to overpolluters. We do not know anything about the government's so-called 'safeguard mechanism'. We do not know how contracts allocated under the Emissions Reduction Fund could be for a five-year period, as the government claims, off a four-year funding base. We do not know how we can have crediting periods under the Emissions Reduction Fund for three to 15 years with a financial commitment of four years. The Minister for the Environment, Mr Hunt, has not explained how Australia could meet its target without applying a cap on pollution. And he has not made it at all clear why polluters should participate, given that there are insufficient incentives and no indication of what the benchmark auction price should be. </span>

While President Obama is taking action on climate change, hitting a 17 per cent emissions reduction target, Mr Abbott is running in the opposite direction with a policy that will not even achieve a five per cent emissions reduction. And to equate Direct Action with President Obama's Clean Power Plan, frankly, is to insult our American friends, who are fully aware that serious action on carbon pollution needs to involve a market based mechanism. I quote again from the explanatory memorandum: 'In economic terms, it internalises the externalities.' </span>

The policy we are debating, this bill, the product stewardship for oil bill, will increase the levy for certain oils in order to encourage the use of recycled oils and encourage the increased collection and recycling of used oils. It will put a price on oils, which will achieve an environmental outcome. Let's take that policy and let's put it to work with carbon pollution. Let's internalise the externalities and let's actually make a difference to carbon pollution.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:36</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of the Tariff Amendment (Product Stewardship for Oil) Bill 2014 and related bills. The Tariff Amendment (Product Stewardship for Oil) Bill 2014 seeks to secure the cost neutrality of the Product Stewardship for Oil scheme, safeguarding the work that it has been doing in the fields of environmental sustainability and resource creation over the past 13 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the Howard government that introduced the Product Stewardship for Oil scheme in 2001—a self-sustaining scheme that uses the revenue raised by excise and custom tariffs on petroleum based oil imports to pay for benefits ranging between 3c and 50c per litre to incentivise the recycling of used oil. In the months following the implementation of the scheme, rates of proper oil deposits by consumers were on the rise and a new industry in oil recycling and refining emerged. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the PSO scheme in providing significant incentives for the recycling of used oil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recycling and reuse of resources stimulates and diversifies the economy by carving out a space for re-refiners and recyclers of oils to provide an innovative service to the industry. The government has been pleased to watch a vigorous industry for the collection and sale of used oils emerge, especially in the eastern states. However, at the heart of the government's intent for the financial mechanism of the scheme was that the excise levy's purpose was to fully fund the benefit scheme, As the original intent for the scheme to finance itself has been breached, with the PSO running at a deficit, this bill seeks to increase customs and excise levies from 5.449c per litre or kilogram to 8.5c per litre or kilogram.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This increase to 8.5c per litre is in line with Aither's independent report to the government's recommendation that the levy be increased to at least 7c per litre or kilogram. It comes after PricewaterhouseCoopers' report in 2009 that the financial position of the PSO scheme had 'deteriorated' and that the excise would soon need to be increased. This measure is estimated to result in a gain to revenue over the forward estimates period of $79 million, bringing the scheme into a cost-neutral position and continue to provide significant, costed incentives for the recycling of used oil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PSO is a levy-benefit system, intended to finance itself by offsetting the cost of benefits with excises on imports. In this way, the oil industry in Australia finances its own risk management and removes significant health and environmental risks inherent in the improper disposal of oil. The cost of paying scaled benefits to recyclers has now outstripped the revenue the government secures by applying the excise and customs tariffs. The challenge that this places on the scheme is discussed in the third independent report to the government prepared for the Department of the Environment in September 2013. That states that the review found:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">A major structural imbalance in the levy-benefit arrangement that is resulting in current annual deficits, which will be compounded by known increases in re-refining capacity, and is financially unsustainable in the long term.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… surpluses generated by changes to levy-benefit arrangements could be redistributed towards investment in new or renewed collections infrastructure and more directly incentivising collections activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Annual deficits have partly been due to an increase in claims of the highest benefit scale, category 1, which pertains to large re-refining ventures. In consultation with the industry, government had concerns that category 1 claims were difficult to police and subject to frequent or even double claims. There may be further potential to tighten legislation around this area, but the increase in excise will mean that the scheme is not so financially vulnerable to sudden fluctuations or increases in particular categories of benefit claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the third independent report to the government, it is small to medium enterprises that are the biggest beneficiaries of this incentive scheme. The coalition has always prided itself on our commitment to the flourishing of small to medium enterprises, which is another reason why this bill is commendable in securing beneficial economic schemes like the PSO. My own electorate of Barton is host to a resource recovery centre administrated by SITA in Rockdale—an innovator and job creator in the area. The recovery centre provides residents and commercial bodies with a safe and environmentally responsible means of disposing of their household or business oil, which is then recycled by the centre.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disposing of petroleum based oil such as motor oil through small enterprises like SITA is becoming much more common since the introduction of the PSO scheme. The Australian Bureau of Statistics found that, between 2009 and 2012, Australians taking their oil to businesses to dispose of in the proper way jumped by 10 per cent. This kind of increase became evident in 2001, shortly following the scheme's introduction. In 2012 to 2013, approximately 311 megalitres of oil were collected through responsible recycling schemes. The amount actually recycled has gone from nil in the year 2000 to approximately 80 megalitres in 2011-12.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the passion of collection and recycling initiatives such as the Rockdale Resource Recovery Centre to turn waste into a resource. To demonstrate just how radically the scheme has shifted the way we look at used oil and increased consumer respect for environmental hazards over the past 13 years, I will quote from the third independent report to the government:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">The Scheme incentivises the recovery and re-use of used oil, at low overall cost to the Australian community, and with low implementation and compliance costs. In large parts of the country, used oil is no longer regarded as a waste but instead as a resource. More broadly, environmental and public health costs due to improper disposal of used oils and lubricants have been reduced or eliminated</span>
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By incentivising individuals, businesses and recyclers to cooperate in ensuring that oil is recycled, the government is fulfilling its obligations to all citizens who benefit from the continued use and reuse of oil as well as its obligations to the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians understand that oil is both a precious and an easily mishandled resource. Supply is valuable and finite but integral to our way of life in this advanced nation of ours. Equally so, Australians are well aware that disposing of oil in waterways or drains can be dangerous. In recycling used oil, both problems are addressed in one fell swoop. So easily mishandled is the disposal of oil that Professor Jean-Daniel Saphores, an expert in natural resource economics, declared in 2002 that used oil is 'the single largest environmentally hazardous recyclable material'. Once exposed to waterways or the natural environment more generally, used oil exerts a damaging pollutant effect and is difficult to remove. Used oil is often contaminated and much more hazardous to the environment than new oil, which is why recycling used oil is such a priority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a measure of a responsible government to provide incentives and guidance to the community and enterprise with regards to the proper disposal and recycling of hazardous materials. In fact, oil industries and consumers face penalties and compliance measures from the Environmental Protection Agency if they do not dispose of oil correctly. With the PSO scheme, the government instead rewards initiative and responsibility rather than punishing noncompliance. The transitional assistance provided to industries by the government as part of this scheme has been integral to its success. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clearly in the best interests of the environment, public health, the growing recycling industry and the public purse that this legislation receives the support of the House. It is a sensible and simple measure, which has been a long time coming. After all, in 2009, after consultation with the industry and detailed reports by PricewaterhouseCoopers advising the government of sustainability doubts, there was no legislative action taken to restore the viability of the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition can be proud that we are legislating in this area at last to safeguard this important scheme. By getting on with the job, we are restoring certainty and viability to the industry after doubts have accompanied its operations since its inception, especially over the last half-decade. Supporting this legislation comes down to the fact that, when schemes are running at a deficit, the government must act. The PSO scheme was never intended to run at a loss, but should be able to self-finance. This is true of the nation's balance sheet as a whole. It is not normal or excusable to be running levy-benefit systems such as the PSO at a loss. We can and should be working towards cost-neutral positions for our programs as we take the road to surplus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the financial state of this scheme has been rolling into deficit and out of the government's full control warns of the way in which numerous other government programs became untenable and unsustainable over the past six years. The government is committed to ensuring that good schemes such as the Product Stewardship for Oil scheme do not go the same way. We are committed to the future of the oil recycling industry and to the future of this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to seeing the implementation of a clear, costed and viable measure for the resources and recycling industry and strongly commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:47</span>):  I would like to join my colleague the member for Barton to talk about this legislation and to give it the thumbs up. We are here to talk about the Excise Tariff Amendment (Product Stewardship for Oil) Bill 2014 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Product Stewardship for Oil) Bill 2014. These bills amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to restore the PSO scheme to being budget neutral. The scheme has got out of hand of late and is $10 million in deficit. What we are proposing in this legislation will bring the scheme back to being budget neutral over the forward estimates by increasing the levy payable by oil producers and importers for petroleum products, oils and greases and their synthetic equivalents, to move the price to 8.5c per litre on oil or kilogram of grease. The current scheme offers a subsidy for the proper recycling of used oil—that is, companies into re-refining of oils get a subsidy of about 50c a litre. This is currently funded by the 5.449c per litre or kilogram but that is not enough. This legislation proposes that we increase the 5.449c per litre to 8.5c. As I said before, that will make the budget neutral and no money will change hands at the end of the day. So the importers of the oil will pay for the re-refining of the lubes, which have great benefit, as I will mention down the track. That is what this bill is all about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do we support this scheme and why did we come up with this bill? Three hundred and fifty million litres of waste oil is created every day in Australia. The full recycling of used lubes requires a very substantial industrial and market investment by companies willing to put up the hard funds to build re-refineries. The 50c a litre incentive is needed to make the full recycling of these lubes a viable business operation. It is good for the environment and it is sustainable because we are using more and more oil in Australia. Recycling used oil has many environmental advantages. Used motor oil contains various contaminants including lead, cadmium, chromium, arsenic, dioxins, benzene and polycyclic aromatics. These are hazardous to humans, plants, animals, fish and shellfish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Oil scum on water reduces the health of plants. It kills fish, frogs and any animal that breaths on the water surface. If we can rid ourselves of as much bad surface oil, the better we are going to live. One litre of oil will contaminate about one million litres of water. That is why it is such a hazard and that is why it is so important that we have a clean-up operation. Every tonne of burnt oil in Australia releases more than three tonnes of carbon dioxide or its equivalent. That is why recycling of used oil is so important for our environment and health. Through recycling, used oil can be cleaned by removing all the impurities. It refines the oil back to its original state and the oil can be used again and again, put back into the engines of tractors, trucks and earthmoving equipment. When it is used, the impurities drop out of the oil and it is time for an oil change. That is where this program comes into its full force. Then the trucks go out to the different collection points around the nation and pick up this waste oil, bring it back to the re-refineries and go through the process again. As I said, that can be repeated many times. Oil is not destroyed in any way, shape or form in an engine. It is the impurities, the additives, that go into the oil to make grease—and oil, originally. With all this thickening and hardening of an oil it becomes grease. That is how grease is made. There are a lot of impurities and other chemicals in that oil to make it a grease, a heavy oil or a light oil, depending on what you want. I can speak from some experience on this because I was a fuel distributor, and I have sold a lot of oil in my day.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is good news for central Queensland, Queensland and the rest of Australia is a company called Southern Oil. They are in the member for Riverina's country, in Wagga Wagga. They do a tremendous job across the nation. They built a plant, and it was only open in March of this year, at a cost of about $55 million. It is a huge plant. It is well designed. You could eat your lunch off the floor of the plant; it is a very cleanly operated plant. It is a credit to that company, Southern Oil in partnership with J.J. Richards. They call the plant in Gladstone the Northern Oil Refinery. In the member for Riverina's seat it is called Southern Oil. Whatever it is called, it is a company that is owned by the same guys, and they do a fantastic job. The plant in Gladstone can process a million litres of waste oil every year. That is 30 per cent of the Australian waste lube oil. It provides significant environmental benefits, as I mentioned before. It employs about 45 permanents in Gladstone and five or six other contract type people who run around in trucks and pick up the oil. It is a great asset for Gladstone and a great asset for Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Previous to re-refining oil, some terrible things happened in the old days. Mainly it was burnt off in refineries and things of that nature. Some of it was—and of course we all realise it now—simply thrown on the ground. They actually used to settle down the sand on racetracks with waste oil. That practice, as of now, has been wiped out for very good reasons, so we do not use waste oil on racetracks anymore. So the incentive to recycle oil is getting stronger and stronger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have just got to commend this bill. It is a wonderful bill. It will do a lot for looking after our waste oil, not putting it into the furnaces, not throwing it on the ground. Oil is getting very precious. There is less and less oil. We can have gas. We can have coal-fired power stations. We can have all sorts of other different energy—wind and solar—but you cannot run an engine on those sorts of energy supplies. It has to be oil. They say, 'Oils ain't oils, mate.' But that is what they need. The oil as it comes out of this refinery is as clear as crystal. It is a beautiful product, actually, when you see it in its raw state. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:56</span>):  I commend the member for Flynn for his interest in re-refining oil. We just heard a very wide-ranging speech from the member for Flynn. In his true style he talked about the bills before us. He also talked about racing. I know his galloper Territory is running in Sydney this weekend. May it well win. Certainly oil used to be used to smooth down racetracks. I know the member for Flynn has more than a passing interest in racing. He certainly has more than a passing interest in his electorate of Flynn and the progress thereof.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I very much welcomed joining him at Yarwun on 12 March this year where, indeed, the Wagga Wagga based company Southern Oil expanded into the city of Gladstone. That came about as a result of some concerted lobbying by both the member for Flynn and me to see this fantastic Riverina company expand. It does, as the member for Flynn pointed out, re-refine oil. A good friend of both the member for Flynn, Ken O'Dowd, and me is Tim Rose, the Southern Oil Managing Director, who has expanded its operations and called it Northern Oil Refinery. They are doing a great job. The Northern Oil Refinery opened, as I said, on 12 March. The Queensland Minister for Environment and Heritage protection, Andrew Powell, joined the federal Minister for Industry, Ian Macfarlane, the member for Groom, as well as the member for Flynn and me at the opening. What a novelty. We had an LNP minister for the environment and a Commonwealth minister for industry coming together to celebrate, to commemorate, to open an industry. That would not have happened under Labor, would it, Member for Flynn?</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr McCORMACK:</span>
                    </a>  No, it would not have happened. What a shame that sort of cooperation did not happen when we talked about the Murray-Darling Basin. What a shame that, when the then Prime Minister went to Goolwa to announce additional water for South Australia prior to the last election—before she was knifed by the member for Griffith—she did not take the agriculture minister with her to undertake this sort of collaboration and cooperation between industry and the environment. It is something our own Minister for the Environment, who has just joined us at the table, is so interested in doing: getting out of the way and making sure that these industries, with the right restrictions in place, get on with the job of making sure that Australia is open for business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the many projects that the Minister for the Environment in the Abbott-Truss coalition has given the tick of approval to. He, like the member for Groom, our Minister for Industry, and like the Queensland Minister for Environment and Heritage Protection, certainly very much approves of this Northern Oil Refinery. It goes to the heart of the particular legislation before us—the Excise Tariff Amendment (Product Stewardship for Oil) Bill 2014 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Product Stewardship for Oil) Bill 2014—which is there to ensure the environmentally sustainable management, re-refining and re-use of used oil and to support economic recycling options for used oil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme currently operates by offering a subsidy for the proper recycling of old oils, funded by a 5.44c per litre levy on new oil or per kilogram of grease sales, as the member for Flynn indicated. In 2013-14, the scheme is estimated to run a deficit of about $10 million, and this is expected to grow. The benefit for category 8 oils provides a refund mechanism for producers of oils which are specifically declared by the Minister for the Environment—the good minister at the table—because they do not create a recyclable user stream and are of low risk to the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last parliament, all we ever heard about with the environment was what the Greens wanted. It was Labor being led by the nose by the Greens. Everything was at the behest of the Greens, and industry was being held up. Business was being stymied at every turn by the Labor-Greens alliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was so refreshing to hear Mr Rose at the opening on 12 March in Gladstone, in the electorate of the member for Flynn, talk about what a unique event he was attending. 'You are here to help Southern Oil and JJ Richards and Sons launch a project which represents an investment in manufacturing, an investment in regional Australia and an investment in a better environmental future,' Mr Rose said. 'It will not be a day the joint-venture partners will forget. We hope for all of you it will be something to remember to be at the start of a new industrial enterprise.' And indeed it was. He said, 'At a time in Australia where much of the news is about how tough it is, particularly in manufacturing, we have stood up and committed to a significant investment in the future.' Indeed they have. It is an investment that is pumping millions of dollars into the electorate of the member for Flynn and dozens of jobs into that very vibrant city of Gladstone, a city that is going ahead in leaps and bounds under the stewardship and the representation of the member for Flynn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The plant and equipment that are installed on the site are state-of-the-art. I am very proud to say that they have been painted in a mustardy colour which Tim Rose calls 'Wagga Wagga wheat'. It resembles the wonderful wheatfields in my electorate. 'To the uninitiated,' as Tim Rose pointed out, 'lube oil may not sound too sexy, but it is essential'—as we heard the member for Flynn say. Mr Rose said it is the stuff that 'keeps your cars running, planes in the air, mining and farming equipment going—it literally lubricates the wheels of commerce and industry' right here in Australia. He said: 'Lubricating oil doesn't wear out; it just gets dirty and the additives in the oil lose effectiveness over time. Here we will re-refine waste lube oil for reuse as lube oil, restoring the oil to its original condition, which is at its highest, best and most environmentally responsible use.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was an excellent article, just after the opening, written by Mara Pattison-Sowden in the local <span style="font-style:italic;">Gladstone Observer</span>. She said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">with a refinery three times the size that can process 100 million litres of oil a year—the same amount of waste oil that Queensland produces annually.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will slash the need to dig for more oil while cutting carbon emissions by 300 million tonnes a year.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Three hundred million tonnes a year! That is a great success story, and it is a success story promoting business, promoting industry, and at the same time looking after the environment. You can do things which are good for the environment and things which help protect our clean, green image whilst at the same time adding jobs, adding investment and adding money into a regional city such as Gladstone. The Yarwun based site had many, many construction jobs, and a lot of the training came from Wagga Wagga. Of course, the construction phase is now over, and it is the production phase at full tilt. It is a great success story.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Mr Rose, Southern Oil injects $15 million into the region's economy each year. That is just tremendous. Interestingly, I also have a media release from Mr Rose, who says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He praised the Minister for the Environment, Greg Hunt, who is here at the table; the Minister for Industry, Ian Macfarlane, who was there at the 12 March opening; and the member for Flynn; as well as me, for our 'commitment to ensure the oil re-refining industry was protected'. Here is an interesting quote:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Oil Refinery was built based on a policy which Tim Rose and JJ Richards and Sons hoped would continue. They put in the faith, based on information that they had received from the previous Labor government, and Mr Rose was so thankful that our government is not only looking after the environment but looking after industry as well by backing his particular venture. He says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A recent report to the Federal Government had made recommendations to change the PSO which would be a disaster for true oil re-refining, so we told the government loud and often about our concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And indeed he did. I know he talked to the member for Flynn. He also talked to me. The Minister for the Environment, who is at the table, also had discussions with this company because he knew how important it was not just for industry but for the environment. As Tim Rose said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has listened and kept its PSO Scheme promises that were made before the Abbott Government was even elected.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So here again we have an industry leader talking about how we keep our promises, how we keep our commitments that we made and certainly commitments that are good to the environment and good for business and industry. Tim Rose went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Budget outcome means re-refiners like Southern Oil can continue to recycle lube oil and remove hundreds of thousands of greenhouse gas emissions from the Australian environment every year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a great success story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Southern Oil and Northern Oil re-refining process is a 'cradle to cradle' treatment of oil and the highest form of recycling—keeping a lube oil in productive use, delivering improved oil security through avoided imports and a lower carbon footprint compared to the production of imported crude. We heard Ken O'Dowd talk before about how good the re-refined oil looked. I will just hold up this sample—I know it is a prop—to show this looks almost as good as this water on the table here. It is quite incredible the way that they take used oil, take out the additives and nasties, as Ken O'Dowd said, and convert it into oil that can be reused over and over again. How good is that for the environment? How good is that for industry, particularly for a regional city like Gladstone, right in Central Queensland at the heart of so much of Australia's valuable mining and manufacturing industries. It is the next generation in waste oil management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Oil Refinery is a first for Queensland, and I do not think they have finished yet, Member for Flynn. Thanks to your great support and advocacy and the great support of the Minister for the Environment, I think we will see this firm expand, possibly into Western Australia and even into South Australia in the future. They can see a niche market to convert used oil into oil that can be used over and over again. That is going to be good for industry and it is certainly going to be good for the environment. The re-refining plant at Gladstone can process 100 per cent of Queensland's annual production of used lube oil. That represents a wonderful environmental opportunity for the state, for industry and particularly for Central Queensland, which is so well represented in the seat of Flynn by Ken O'Dowd. It is the only facility capable of recycling waste lube oil back into base lube oil in Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know how much value the Deputy Prime Minister—currently the Acting Prime Minister—places on the Northern Oil Refinery. I know how interested he was in seeing this facility was open, as was the member for Groom, the Minister for Industry, who is getting on with the job of showing that Tony Abbott is the infrastructure Prime Minister and making Australia open for business. At both Wagga Wagga and Gladstone there has been strong support from waste oil producers such as mines and local governments in directing that their waste lube oil is re-refined rather than burnt and wasted, which happens all too often right throughout Australia. We use a lot of oil and the carbon footprint is very high. That is why plants such as these are getting on with the job of re-converting it. Tim Rose said:</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:12</span>):  I particularly want to take this opportunity to speak in relation to the Excise Tariff Amendment (Product Stewardship for Oil) Bill 2014 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Product Stewardship for Oil) Bill 2014, which are part of the government's overall economic strategy announced in the budget. We made the point that we would restore the Product Stewardship for Oil scheme to being budget neutral over the forward estimates period. What does it mean in practice? It means that there was a problem we inherited, a mess which needed to be fixed, and we have done that. And what that means is that the product stewardship sector will be able to continue, which will bring good environmental benefits, and it will have a certain basis for industry and investment going forward. The member for Flynn and the member for Riverina have both spoken in this debate and contributed to this outcome significantly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In practice, this bill achieves what we have sought by increasing the rate of levy payable under the scheme to 8½c per litre of oil or kilogram of grease as generated or brought into Australia, because it is primarily brought into Australia, from 1 July 2014. It puts the industry and the product stewardship process on a stable footing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does it mean for the environment? We have a problem at the moment where used oil is insoluble, persistent and slow to degrade and evaporate. It does great damage to the system. Secondly, used oil often contains contaminants such as toxic chemicals and heavy metals. It poses a greater environmental risk then new oil. Improper disposal of this used oil can have catastrophic effects on the environment and public health and can pollute land, waterways and underground reservoirs. As a consequence of that, through the product stewardship scheme we are reducing environmental and other impacts of products by encouraging or requiring manufacturers, importers and distributors to take responsibility for these products. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Product Stewardship for Oil scheme was established in 2001 by the Howard government. It continues today, with strong support from industry and environmental stakeholders. It was, however, not operating in a way which was budget neutral and so the changes we have made seek to ensure that the investment, which has occurred in areas such as the Riverina and Gladstone, is on a full and sustainable basis going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the Product Stewardship for Oil scheme being introduced, it was estimated that 160 million litres of used oil were collected annually, compared to 270 million litres today. So an additional 100 million litres of waste oil is being collected. As a consequence of this scheme and, in particular, as a consequence of the stability which we have built into it, 16 oil recyclers are now operating in Australia. It is estimated that their collective turnover is at least $3 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Gladstone, Southern Oil Refinery and J.J. Richards have just opened a new $55 million used-oil refinery, which is able to process up to 100 million litres of used oil a year. It has created 70 jobs. In Wagga Wagga, the Southern Oil Refinery employs around 30 people. Only today I met with representatives of Transpacific, which is a $1.6 billion ASX-listed Australian waste and recycling company. Their plants in Brisbane, Rutherford and Wetherill Park collect around 160 million litres of oil. So accessing the Product Stewardship for Oil scheme is critical to the viability of these environmentally sustainable businesses. We have made a change; it is an important change. It puts the industry on a sustainable basis. It is the right thing to do by the environment, it is the right thing to do for job certainty, investment certainty and the future in this space. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  I would like to thank those members who have contributed to the debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Product Stewardship for Oil) Bill 2014 and cognate bill. These bills restore the Product Stewardship for Oil scheme to being budget neutral over the forward estimates. This fulfils a commitment given by the government in the budget. The Product Stewardship for Oil scheme offers a benefit for the proper recycling of old oils, funded by a levy on new oils and greases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This ensures the environmentally sustainable management, refining, re-refining and reuse of used oil and supports the economic recycling options for used oil. The Product Stewardship for Oil scheme was intended to be self-funding but, in the 2013-14 year, the scheme is estimated to run a deficit of approximately $10 million and this is expected to grow. To ensure the scheme is budget neutral over the forward estimates these bills amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to increase excise levy and excise equivalent customs duty on petroleum based oils and their synthetic equivalents from 5.449c per litre of oil or a kilogram of grease to 8.05c.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes ensure the ongoing sustainability of the scheme. The government of course does not support the amendment moved by the opposition. We do not support the passionate defence by the shadow Assistant Treasurer of Labor's carbon tax. Once again, we find ourselves faced with a situation where Labor have attempted, through an amendment to this bill, to once again reassert their completely myopic approach to both economic policy and environmental policy in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite extraordinary that the Labor Party, through the shadow Assistant Treasurer, have moved an amendment, seeking to once again attempt to justify their approach to their failed carbon tax. This carbon tax, which was the world's largest carbon tax, has put a dampener on economic activity. We saw the consequence, with the election of the coalition government, on consumer confidence. We saw the consequence, with the election of the coalition government, of the then optimistic view of the people of Australia following the successful election of the coalition. Unfortunately, instead of respecting the mandate that the Australian people gave the coalition, almost primary among them the fact that we would repeal the world's biggest carbon tax that was introduced by the Labor Party, we now have the shadow Assistant Treasurer moving an amendment to this bill, attempting to justify the carbon tax, saying that the carbon tax is the right approach to protecting Australia's environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw only yesterday the President of the United States outline, through the EPA, an approach to dealing with climate change which, virtually in all respects, mirrors the approach of the coalition government. We have seen a sound approach put forward by the environment minister through the Emissions Reduction Fund and through Direct Action to Australia actually making a contribution to improving the environment but not sacrificing Australia's economic competency or our international economic competitiveness as a consequence. The fact that the United States' approach accords with the coalition's approach and the fact that the Australian people recognise that we have a mandate and indeed provided us with the very mandate that we seek to exercise in this parliament just underscores how completely out of touch the Australian Labor Party continues to be. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To have an amendment moved to this bill by the shadow Assistant Treasurer, which attempts to portray the carbon tax as, in some way, shape or form being in Australia's interests just demonstrates that Labor has not learnt a single thing at the last election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is even more jarring that the Australian Labor Party earlier today, in numerous debates in this chamber, railed against what they believe to be an attack on the living standards of impoverished Australians and various strata of Australian society and yet in this amendment to the bill actually attempt to defend their approach to the carbon tax, which is imposing on Australian households an additional $550 a year. So, fundamentally, the coalition's approach to this bill is to put us back on a sustainable economic footing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, more importantly, the coalition rejects the amendment that has been moved by the Labor Party because it underscores Labor's failed approach. It disrespects the mandate the coalition has with respect to the carbon tax and that is to repeal it. Fundamentally, if Labor's carbon tax stays in place, it simply puts more pressure on battling Australian households for no environmental benefit whatsoever and, for that reason, we reject the amendment. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURKE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:24</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Amendment Bill 2014. This bill makes a series of amendments to the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. The legislation that we are debating today is supported by the opposition. Much of the work for this legislation was done while Senator Wong was the minister for finance. It effectively deals with a number of the probity issues concerning public governance and ensures that many of the provisions currently contained within the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 find their way into the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act, which then determines much of the potential framework of the government. It will consolidate in one piece of legislation all the governance, performance and accountability requirements for Commonwealth government entities.    The act aims to improve transparency and consistency across Commonwealth operations. The act is also designed as an evolution to the existing financial framework, containing new elements which are designed to improve the quality of public financial management in the Commonwealth. The act itself was subject to a two-year-long consultation and consideration process prior to being passed by the parliament last year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The act sets out the principles of a coherent financial framework for all Commonwealth entities and aims to create a financial framework where Commonwealth entities have the flexibility and incentives to adopt appropriate systems and processes that help them to achieve their objectives efficiently and effectively. The nearly 12-month period since its passage has allowed for further consultation and consideration by relevant stakeholders in order to refine its operation. The amendments contained within the bill being debated today are a result of this consultation, which, as I said, commenced when we were in government. Now in opposition we will be supporting this bill and the amendments contained in it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of the amendments are either minor or technical, or substantive amendments that are sensible to make in order to facilitate the effective operation of the legislation. I would also note the work done by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, which has conducted and completed an inquiry into the development of the rules relating to the act. The rules, which will provide further clarification or detail to the main act in the same way that the current regulations to the FMA Act and the CAC Act operate, are not part of the legislation being debated today and I do not propose to take that part of the discussion any further. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that we will be supporting this bill and the amendments contained in it, I will not add to the detail that was brought to the attention of the House during the minister's speech. However, in the course of my speech today I will quickly outline some of the more substantive amendments contained in the bill. Items 1 to 7 either insert or amend definitions in the act that are required as a result of new terms being introduced in the bill, or to clarify existing terms in the Act. Items 8 to 61 involve amendments to chapter 2 of the act, which relates to Commonwealth entities. The majority of these items relating to Commonwealth entities—which are departments of state, parliamentary departments, listed entities and body corporates that are not specifically Commonwealth companies—are minor or technical in nature, hardly controversial. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to briefly cover some of the more substantive amendments contained in this section of the bill. Item 14 clarifies the definition of an official for the purposes of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act by replacing the current definition with an expanded set of provisions to make it clear who is covered by the definition of 'official'. Item 17 allows accountable authorities to issue instructions to officials in the same way as the current Chief Executive Instructions are able to be issued under the FMA Act. This is important to ensure that instructions can be given to officials about the management of public resources in the same way that exists under the current legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Items 20 to 27 of the bill clarify that only accountable authorities or members of accountable authorities can have their appointments terminated under section 30 of the act—an important clarification that would avoid the possible confusion that all officials were covered under that particular section. Item 35 of the bill requires annual reports to be provided to ministers by the 15th day of the fourth month after the reporting period, another way of describing October, so that annual reports can be provided as per the current arrangements outlined in the existing financial framework legislation, and that it aligns with the current Senate estimates timetable. Item 39 of the bill clarifies the responsibilities for ministers and officials in relation to the banking of or dealing with relevant money. Items 62 to 64 of the bill involve amendments to chapter 3 of the act relating to Commonwealth companies. These amendments are minor and not controversial, and, most importantly, they maintain consistency with other parts of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not go through the remaining items in details so that I do not have to ask to conclude at a later moment. I will say that this goes to important issues of governance within the Commonwealth and it has the support of the opposition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  I rise this evening to speak on the plight of apprentices. Before the election, the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, spent a lot of time in a fluoro vest and a hard hat, gladhanding apprentices and workers. He said: 'An incoming coalition government will help more young Australians to start a trade, stay in a trade and finish a trade.' But these were hollow words. It is now clear that the Prime Minister has treated apprentices with the same contempt he has treated everyone else whom this budget has hurt. What the Prime Minister did not say was that he would trash the tools for trade program and halve its funding which paid for apprentices' tools. He has cut the scheme's funding from about $1 billion to $476 million over four years and replaced it with the inferior Trade Support Loans Program, which is just going to plunge people further into debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very clear to anyone who works in this field or has a background in it: no tools, no apprentice. The Prime Minister has wrenched the tools from the hands of thousands of apprentices across the country. According to the Minister for Industry, Mr Ian Macfarlane, this cut is okay because apprentices were spending the money on 'tattoos and mag wheels for their cars and birthday parties'. How cynical, wrong and removed from reality can you get. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to read an email from a fourth-year apprentice called Matthew, who said: 'The changes affect me and two other apprentices in my depot along with thousands of other apprentices nationwide who rely on these payments. While I do not agree with the changes to apprentice funding, I am disgusted that they can change the system apprentices such as myself are halfway through.' Another fourth-year apprentice, coincidentally also called Matthew, said: 'The current Abbott government are just going to rip this up without any thought of how it will affect us. Every bit of money helps, especially as I am also supporting my wife and daughter, and paying a mortgage. The removal of this payment is approximately six per cent of my annual income and I could only imagine the uproar if Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey were asked to delete six per cent of their annual income.' This is what an apprentice called Luke said: 'I am grateful that I was the beneficiary of the tools for trade program throughout my apprenticeship. I used the money to buy tools like big ticket items such as drills that cost upwards of $700. Apprentices already struggle with a low income, studying and paying bills. These incentives are what attract young job seekers in the first place without the added stress of paying loans like a tertiary student.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the reality and it is gut-wrenching to hear. Worse still, the Prime Minister's new loan scheme will not cover thousands of current second-, third- and fourth-year apprentices across the country for whom the tools for trade program is essential. So what happens to them? Where do they get the money from to pay for their tools midway through their apprenticeships? The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the industry minister just could not care less. It appears that the Prime Minister has left thousands of apprentices who depend on the tools for trade program simply swinging in the breeze. What makes it worse is that the cuts to funding for the tools for trade program are completely avoidable. The Prime Minister could have kept the tools for trade scheme intact and instead ended the $12 billion taxpayer subsidy to the fossil fuel industry to fund it. The Prime Minister could have gone one better and increased the funding to the tools for trade program by, for example, not needlessly spending at least $24 billion on 58 joint strike fighters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the Greens called for a construction-led stimulus package for the south-east of the country and Western Australia. What I said in February is just as true now. Now is the time to cut $12 billion in corporate welfare from the fossil fuel sector to drive a clean economy and secure jobs in south-east Australia. By building more public housing and fast-tracking public transport projects, we can find jobs for the workers facing redundancy, address the housing crisis and care for the planet all at once. Supporting construction, design and manufacturing jobs by building 77½-thousand new houses over the next 10 years would create thousands of jobs, including for apprentices. The Abbott government could do this right now but chooses not to. What we need is a plan that reboots our manufacturing base, uses our manufacturing expertise and retools workers, apprentices and manufacturing for the new economy that is emerging right around the world. But if we take the tools away from the builders, the plumbers, the carpenters and the electricians of tomorrow, our very future is in doubt. I say to our apprentices: the Greens will fight to put tools back in your hands. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="230485" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHRISTENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Nationals Deputy Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  Canegrowers are a conservative lot. In a traditionally conservative state like Queensland, these men and women, who are often third- and fourth-generation farmers, are possibly the most conservative of all. They are proud of their links to the land and proud to run their own show, and you generally find them getting on with what they do best without too much fuss and bother. Until now, that is, as they have been thrust into a battle not of their making and it is a battle with a bitter twist. It is hard to imagine what could possibly prompt such a conservative lot to band together and protest. Yet, that is exactly what happened yesterday in the Burdekin district, which is in my electorate of Dawson. About 160 growers who supply to Inkerman mill, as well as some of the growers who supply to Pioneer Mill, refused to start harvesting. They effectively went on strike. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gong for prompting them to take such a strong stance goes to Singapore based Wilmar Sugar, who stunned everyone in the industry by announcing one fine morning in April that they would exit their sugar marketing arrangements with Queensland Sugar Limited, or QSL, at the end of the 2016 season and set up their own marketing arm. Wilmar have not acknowledged the protest action by growers, but they have been forced to delay the crush. It is a small victory in this battle with a bitter twist. Growers are fighting for the right to determine how their two-thirds economic interest in raw sugar is marketed, a right which is effectively being ripped away by the Wilmar proposal. This move is a dog act and I said so in more blunt language on the day that it was made, and I stand by what I said on that day. They acted without any prior consultation with growers, choosing instead to announce first, and then talk later.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Growers are increasingly alarmed by the scenario painted by Wilmar. They are concerned about the lack of transparency in the proposed structure. They are concerned about the implications for competition in the Australian sugarcane industry in the long term. And they are concerned about the lack of choice being offered to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a series of meetings organised by the grower collectives CANEGROWERS and the Australian Cane Farmers Federation, who represent 80 per cent of Australian canegrowers, there has been overwhelming rejection of Wilmar's proposal. In the ongoing call to action, more than 3,150 objections to Wilmar's actions have been lodged. There are 4,000 growers across Queensland and New South Wales, so that represents a massive response of 78 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the implications for competition, there are real concerns that Wilmar may be in contravention of sections 46 and 47 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, and this issue has been raised with the ACCC. I would call on the ACCC to take this matter seriously and to act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the largest sugar miller, processing some 14 million tonnes of cane each year, Wilmar is in a monopoly position and has a corporate responsibility to not act in an anticompetitive manner. Section 46 prohibits a corporation with a substantial degree of power in a market from taking advantage of that power to eliminate or substantially damage a competitor. Section 47 prohibits exclusive dealing. Wilmar is engaging in 'third line forcing' that requires growers to use an exclusive Wilmar structure to market growers' sugar, denying growers the option of using the marketing services of another supplier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wilmar came to Australia in 2010 making all the promises in the world. They made commitments to the Foreign Investment Review Board and to the Australian government that they had no plans to meddle with the marketing arrangements that were in place. They are now going down the track they have carved out in every other country, treating their suppliers as peasant farmers rather than business partners in a mutually beneficial economic arrangement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to pose a hypothetical in relation to this issue. I understand that sometime later this year Wilmar will have to send out notices to growers to change the supply agreement, noting that it will no longer be QSL but Wilmar marketing their sugar. It could very well be that, at that time, growers in closer proximity to Mackay Sugar mills—like those in Sarina, who are ably represented by the member for Capricornia, who is sitting beside me here, and those in Proserpine, in my electorate—could reply to Wilmar with a supply agreement of their own. Sarina growers might opt to supply to Racecourse Mill, and Proserpine growers might supply to Farleigh Mill. And I would encourage growers who feel aggrieved by the changes that Wilmar is seeking to wield to seriously consider voting with their feet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This battle with a bitter twist is a fight for growers' rights, and if Wilmar thinks that the entire sugarcane industry—the thousands of sugarcane growers, their families, the workers, and their elected representatives, such as me and the member for Capricornia, and also the member for Hinkler—are going to lie down and let this happen without a fight, they really seriously need to think again.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… when … Rivas participated in the torture of the detainees, she beat them with sticks, she kicked them, punched them and also applied an electric current to [them] …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Though it is the policy of all Australian governments not to comment on extradition matters, it has been publicly reported that the Chilean Supreme Court made a formal request for Ms Rivas's extradition earlier this year. I understand that this request has been received by the Attorney-General's Department and is under consideration by the Commonwealth government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is almost impossible to overstate the seriousness of the allegations made against Ms Rivas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Torture is an abhorrent crime. The use of torture is not just an abuse by the state of its powers. It is a denial of the humanity of the victim. The special repugnance of torture is acknowledged by global civil society. The prohibition on torture is recognised as one of only a handful of fundamental principles of international law from which there are no exceptions, no exemptions, and no derogations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a long tradition of work to rid our world of this terrible crime. Labor foreign minister and later parliamentary leader Doc Evatt helped draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. The Hawke government signed and ratified the Convention Against Torture in 1985 and 1989. Under the Labor government in May 2009 Australia signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. This is a legacy of which I am proud. I hope that the present government continues to work on the process of ratifying the optional protocol.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Though we are lucky to live in a country free of torture, Chile has not been so fortunate. I have a close personal connection with Chile and its people. My wife was born in Chile. I have visited Chile several times, and I lived there with my family in the first half of 1995.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some members of the Chilean community who have spoken to me about the extradition of Ms Rivas are themselves survivors of torture or political violence. All Chileans will have friends or family who have suffered in some way. A number of members of the Australian Chilean community are here in the gallery tonight, and I would like to acknowledge them and their concern about this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the 1970s, Chile had enjoyed political stability and parliamentary democracy since the late 19th century. The wounds the country suffered in the madness after the 1973 coup, however, are still not fully healed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The prosecution of torturers is an important part of the path forward for Chile. I call on the Australian government to hear the concerns of those who have signed this petition. I hope the government will move swiftly to ensure that justice is done by doing everything possible to return Adriana Rivas to Chile to face the trial from which she fled. I present the petition.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This petition of : members of the Chilean community in Australia, draws to the attention of the House the request from the Chilean government for the extradition of Mrs. Adriana Rivas Mrs Rivas is a fugitive from Justice who has been living in Australia free from prosecution. She was arrested in 2006 and processed by the judiciary for her involvement in the aggravated kidnapping and torture of at least 12 people, none of whom survived. Mrs Rivas escaped whilst on house arrest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to: grant the request for extradition so that Mrs. Rivas can be prosecuted for her crimes in Chile. In memory of those that were silenced by the Pinochet dictatorship, we respectfully request that the House takes into consideration the pain and suffering inflicted upon the Chilean people. For over forty years, families of the victims have been seeking justice for their loved ones. Mrs. Rivas like many of her cohorts, must be held accountable for her actions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are troubled by the fact that someone with her criminal background has been allowed to live in Australia and We seek clarification from the Australian government regarding her residency.

                  <a href="165476" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SCOTT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  For the past 57 days, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> and Western Sydney News, local papers, together with Channel 7 and Nova have run a very successful campaign highlighting all the local heroes, local legends, rising stars and the incredible opportunities Western Sydney has to offer. And again I am proud to say that Penrith and the Nepean Valley have definitely pulled above their weight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those members who followed my Facebook or Twitter accounts would be aware of some of the amazing and remarkable contributions of people from the Lindsay electorate. For instance, on Tuesday, 20 May, in the 'Best in the West Food Finalists', that <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> highlighted a number of great businesses in the Lindsay electorate. For starters, you could go to Zokoko, that have handcrafted chocolate and handcrafted coffee. You could have a pub feed at Colyton. If you were after a good breakfast there were three businesses that made the list: Belle Saveur Patisserie Cafe, which is known for having the Ryan Girdler grind, and Henri Marc, which are both in Penrith, or the Lewis Gallery in Emu Plains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who are up for a bit of a thrill, on Tuesday 27 May the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> highlighted the best activities for adventure in Western Sydney. There were six activities, of which three were in Lindsay: IFly Downunder, Australia's first indoor skydiving centre; the Penrith Whitewater Stadium and international Olympic facility; and Jetpack Adventures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other great local organisations featured by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> included local Aboriginal organisation Muru Mittigar, and Little Wings—a very remarkable and wonderful flight service that unites families with their sick children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the campaign, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> sought out images from locals to capture the West. No surprises: it went to a resident, Hailey McFarlane from Glenmore Park, who won the award with an amazing photo of four generations of her family, that all come from Western Sydney. As someone who herself can claim multigenerations from Western Sydney, I know what that looks like.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Upon winning the award, Hailey said that the photo is as much about where she is from as it is about her grandmother, her mother, herself and her daughter. It is a fabulous story about the generations, like mine, who have chosen to stay and live in Western Sydney. And really—why wouldn't they?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night, the 'Fair Go for the West' campaign culminated with an awards ceremony at the Rooty Hill RSL. I was proud to attend with the Prime Minister, the New South Wales premier and, of course, my Western Sydney colleagues from both sides of the House. The 'champions of the West' awarded $10,000 grants to projects and initiatives right across Western Sydney in 13 categories. Muru Mittigar Aboriginal Cultural and Education Centre, located at Castlereagh, is an Aboriginal cultural and education centre, and a finalist in the Indigenous category. Many may or may not be aware that Western Sydney does have the largest Indigenous population in the country. This is a wonderful not-for-profit organisation which strives to improve the social and economic wellbeing of Aboriginal people right across Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased to note that the winner of the small business category was the one-and-only Debbie O'Connor from The Creative Fringe. The Creative Fringe connects small business owners with creative talent in Western Sydney, collaborating to make and showcase the incredible talent across the region. In Western Sydney they collaborate and make amazing things happen. I think The Creative Fringe is an amazing example of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think one of the other things about The Creative Fringe and Debbie O'Connor is the 'hot desks' that she is using, actually having all the different small business operators working together. It is a unique business opportunity and it is also a unique work environment for the people of Western Sydney, and it will give them the ability not to have to commute into the city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to congratulate all the winners on the night and throughout the entire 'West' campaign over the previous 57 days. I thank the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> for recognising the potential of this remarkable region. Madam Speaker, there is such a breadth of talent across Western Sydney, and I know that you yourself have lived there and experienced it firsthand. I feel that only a small portion has been recognised in this campaign, but we know our potential; we know the quality we experience every single day. Events and campaigns like this go a very long way to telling our unique story and showcasing it to the rest of Australia. I congratulate the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> for recognising this fabulous region.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="008K0" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BYRNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  I rise tonight to express my concerns on behalf of some important local organisations about the Abbott government budget measures which directly and adversely impact on these organisations and, importantly, on my constituents who seek to access these services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first is the South-Eastern Melbourne Medicare Local, SEMML, which is providing vital primary care support to the local community. It is, importantly, the lead agency that established and manages headspace Dandenong, and is the agency currently tasked by the government for the establishment of a much-needed new headspace in Fountain Gate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the Abbott government's decision to replace the Medicare Local network with a new Primary Health Care Network has thrown SEMML's role in involvement in these two local headspaces into chaos. It will effectively end its involvement and inevitably lead to an unacceptable delay in the rollout of headspace Fountain Gate. In fact, SEMML was about to sign a lease for headspace Fountain Gate before its involvement was terminated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, this is not just local. There are significant national ramifications in the move to abolish Medicare Locals. And that is that the Medicare Locals are lead agencies in the management of at least 30 headspaces across the country. Tonight, these headspaces have an uncertain future. It is imperative that the health minister moves immediately to provide measures to ensure that these headspaces remain open and viable. The last thing we need is for these headspaces to fail. I am aware that the health minister is in discussions with headspace nationally about this issue, but I want to re-emphasise to him and to this chamber how imperative it is to remedy this uncertainty as soon as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I caught up with young people who have been directly affected by youth suicide in my area, including young men and women like Dani Rothwell, Emily Cooper, Jake Downward and Steph Bruders, who raised concerns about the delay in the rollout of headspace Fountain Gate. Young people dealing with depression, substance abuse and other mental health issues in the local community have expressed disappointment to me about the delay in the establishment of headspace Fountain Gate. There is a reason for this—that is, we have a significant challenge with youth suicide in my area. It is why I have campaigned relentlessly and remorselessly to ensure that there was a headspace in Dandenong and a headspace in Fountain Gate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our local area has a significant youth population of more than 60,000 young people in the city of Casey and they deserve and they need a youth-friendly mental health service. With the pressures on our youth in Casey and the need to provide this service, I would again take this opportunity to implore the health minister to rectify this anomaly as rapidly as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another one of the concerning measures in the 2014 budget was the changes to emergency relief funding. Emergency relief funding helps people deal with immediate financial crisis situations in a way that maintains the dignity of the individual and encourages self-reliance. There are over 700 community and charitable organisations around Australia providing emergency relief services including the Cranbourne Information Support Service and the Casey North Information Support Service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work that these organisations do is much needed and it is crucial that governments support them. For example, the Cranbourne Information Support Service, in the financial year 2012-13 CISS—the acronym for the Cranbourne service—saw nearly 8,000 individuals, who represented many families in Casey's south. They also assisted with almost 14,000 different requests for assistance, with over 6,000 of those requests being for emergency relief. During the last financial year, they provided $150,000 of food and petrol vouchers to those in need in our local community, as well as $12,315 in other financial assistance. This does not include food parcels.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Organisations like the Cranbourne Information Support Service and the other 700 services like that do not really need to have their emergency relief funding frozen or, in effect, diminished in real terms, particularly with an outer suburban growth belt corridor like mine in Holt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that concerns me greatly is the cut to the Casey Cardinia Community Legal Service in my electorate. This service provides support to over 1,500 people, primarily women, annually with legal and financial advice, particularly those affected by family violence. We funded an office up until 2017. The funding for that office, as I understand, will be cut in 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The city of Casey is in a terrible situation with domestic violence. The cuts to these services are to be deplored. I urge the government to reconsider the cuts to these particular services.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249758" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLIAMS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  I rise tonight to pay tribute to Allen Bolaffi, a respected business leader in South Australia who passed away suddenly on the weekend. Allen, as the Minister for Education mentioned earlier today in the House, was a man widely regarded in the business community. He was professional, he had a lot of integrity about what he did and he had the best interests of South Australia at heart. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was a champion of the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce for 20 years. He successfully grew that body to become one of the pre-eminent industry associations in South Australia. I attended many of the AICC events over the years and was always impressed with their professionalism and with their wide consultation across both spectrums of politics as well as the broader business community. I want to acknowledge the work that Allen did in his capacity as head of that body over the years. I also want to pass on my condolences to his family, in particular his son, Reuben, who I have come across in my time as a member of parliament. I know these are difficult times and he has lots of support from people around him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Allen was an accountant and also a specialist in financial management. We have heard a lot about financial management over these last couple of weeks of the budget. We just heard the previous speaker talk about some other changes in the budget. We all appreciate that when we do have some financial challenges, we have to do something about them. Sometimes those decisions are challenging and sometimes they need a bit of courage. We have to take action and that is what we are doing this side of the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at the situation we are in at the moment, we have to make some serious changes to what we are doing. This is not our responsibility alone, as we all know. It is our responsibility now, but we have not caused this mess that we are in. If we go back a step, we know that the former Labor government spent so much money and wasted a lot of money with a lot of interest payments going out of Australia each year—around $700 million, which could do a lot for the services that the members opposite speak about such as the services to health and to the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's reduce this deficit, let's get our finances under control so we can fund the health and education services. Members opposite will remember that six years after promising to end the blame game between state and federal governments, they made it worse with a $1.6 billion cut to the projected funding for state public hospitals. On state hospitals, I am pleased that the government has committed more over the next four years to health. In my state of South Australia there is an increase of $293 million over those four years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In education, there will be $275 million over four years. If we look at where our education is now, we have got declining standards according to the World Economics Forum and other reports such as the PISA report. We have got money going in but we also need changes in other areas of our system. I have spoken about that before in the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a couple of other points about where Labor left us. Their border protection budget blew out by more than $11 billion. We all know about the tragic consequences of the deaths at sea. They need to be reminded of that so that they can get that policy right or so they can help us as we are getting the policy right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the Commonwealth debt of $12 billion is three-quarters the size of the entire South Australian budget. I think it is a telling factor that the size of a state budget is the size of the Commonwealth debt. It is probably the size of the Tasmanian budget. That is now. In the future, it will only get worse and become $16 billion if we do not do something now. It is more than the whole cost of the NDIS, more than the entire cost of tertiary education and more than the entire cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. That is why it is imperative that we start making some hard decisions now for the benefit of our future services in this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:30</span>):  I met last week with the executive team from Werribee Mercy Hospital. The Mercy deliver great service to our local community. They have a strong vision for the future of health provision in our area. Wyndham's population is about to reach 200,000. The number of households is expected to double again by 2030. The Werribee Mercy was established in 1994, when the population was estimated to reach around 90,000 in 2004. At the time the local community hospital was the correct service for the area and, despite this huge growth in population, it serves us well, but for how much longer?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mercy Health in Werribee has an extremely well-trained and dedicated staff. Some of the top experts in Victoria choose to work at this service. What the Mercy needs are the facilities to serve this high-growth community. If you present to the Mercy Hospital today with a heart attack, the staff are very well trained to save and stabilise you, but for your long-term ongoing treatment you need to be transferred. At my recent meeting I was told of a doctor spending six hours on the phone to other hospitals trying to secure a transfer for a patient. If the hospital had a coronary care unit, this would have been avoided, meaning the doctor would have been back treating patients in the emergency department. If you are a patient in the ward who unfortunately has a critical incident, you are also likely to be transferred to the emergency department to be stabilised at our local hospital. The six closest hospitals to the Mercy where patients are transferred to are, on average, 35 kilometres away. This lack of critical care services compromises patient care and increases clinical risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the electorate of Lalor, there is a huge number of young families and nearly 70 babies are born each week. There is great need for maternity services. The Mercy team know if they had the appropriate facilities they could provide care for approximately 80 per cent of local women; currently the rate is around 48 per cent. They need 10 more obstetric beds now, let alone extra needed for the predicted growth. Current estimates are that around 40 per cent of the general healthcare needs of my community are being met by the Werribee Mercy, meaning 60 per cent leave the area to obtain health care. There will always be cases that need very specialised services only available in our larger teaching hospitals. It is not appropriate for all hospitals to provide all services, but surely the percentage should be much higher than 40 per cent? Mercy Health has undertaken detailed planning for a carefully staged master plan. They take the provision of health care very seriously and their plans are based on sensible, well-targeted needs. In the past the federal Labor government has worked with this service to fund growth, most recently providing $28 million for subacute beds and a rehabilitation unit. I plan to work closely with Mercy Health to ensure this government hears loud and clear what the health service needs are for my electorate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:33</span>):  I rise to put on the record in the parliament the achievements of one of my great constituents, the world No. 1 in golfing, and a very proud PGA member, Adam Scott. The parliament would be no stranger to Adam and his recent achievements and what he has done in the world of golf. He now holds the No. 1 position in the official world golf rankings. As the parliament would be aware, at the end of May Adam returned to the PGA Tour at the Crowne Plaza Invitational, which was his first tournament contested as the world No. 1. I think we all recognise that he claimed that tournament in dramatic style, confirming to all why he truly is at the pinnacle of his game and currently the world's best golfer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He is certainly a credit to our country; he is certainly an inspiration to young golfers coming through. He is a great bloke; he is an inspiration to his sport. The PGA can be very, very proud of this member of their organisation and this world No. 1. He has represented Australia for many, many years. He represents our nation with professionalism, he represents our nation with class and, just like Greg Norman—the Shark—did decades ago, he has garnered a nation behind him to show what Australia can do on the world stage. There is an argument we can make—and I will certainly make it right here in this House—that he is right now our most successful sportsman currently competing, and we can all be very proud of what he has done.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McGOWAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:34</span>):  Yesterday during question time I asked the Minister for Communications about the possibility of co-locating NBN wireless and private sector telecommunication services to combat mobile phone black spots and speed up the NBN rollout. I thank the minister for his detailed response but note that he did not outline any future funding or initiatives past the $100 million, 250-tower commitment that was announced in the budget. This is despite the fact that 1,550 of the 1,800 black spots reported by everyday Australians to the Department of Communications will remain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most common issues raised with my office is the inadequacy of mobile phone networks. The eight councils in Indi are working with my office to identify priority black spots. For example, in April I asked a local radio station to put out the word that people could contact our office to report their black spots. Following the announcement over 50 people contacted the office and we passed on their black spots to the Department of Communications. Many people also did this of their own volition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give the House some insight into what a few of these 50 people said. Lee in El Dorado called the office and said: 'I want to report a black spot in El Dorado.' My staff asked: 'Where, specifically, in El Dorado?' 'No, no,' said Lee, 'I mean I want to report the entire town of El Dorado. There is just no coverage here.' El Dorado—well named—is 20 minutes from Wangaratta, which is the second largest town in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2009 Kinglake fires devastated lives, communities and the natural environment and millions of dollars were invested by the government in Kinglake to assist recovery. The royal commission into the fires found that a better mobile network was essential for future safety, but I was distressed to find that several Kinglake black spot locations were reported to my office. Despite the serious and well-proven safety need for consistent telecommunications coverage in Kinglake, it still does not exist. For those who have not been to Kinglake, it is just over an hour's drive from the Melbourne CBD—hardly remote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, Kinglake and El Dorado are fairly small towns. What about the major centres of Wodonga, Wangaratta and Benalla? What about the train line that links Indi to Sydney and Melbourne? I doubt you will be surprised to hear that all have black spots.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mobile phones have become a non-negotiable tool for any person engaged in business or employment and as long as black spots in major regional areas exist, the full potential of regional areas will not be met. I call on the government to commit more funding for mobile phone black spots. We need black spots fixed to improve our lives, improve safety and improve the economy of regional areas.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:37</span>):  Last month it was a privilege to host the Hon. Jamie Briggs, Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, in Dobell where we inspected key local infrastructure projects. This government is getting on with the job of building a stronger economy so that everyone can get ahead and we understand the importance of building the infrastructure of the 21st century, especially in electorates such as Dobell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Dobell this means investment in projects that will boost our economy through generating employment and tourism opportunities. I am proud to say that, unlike the previous Labor government, this government understands the importance of delivering our election commitments. The people of Dobell on the Central Coast have long been calling for their fair share of infrastructure funding and for too long our needs were ignored. Dobell will benefit from this government's commitment to build the infrastructure of the 21st century with $7.15 million for local infrastructure projects. Importantly, this investment will be geared towards enhancing our local economy, driving job growth and greater private investment in our region. One such commitment is $2.7 million towards the development of skills and training facilities to boost skills and employment opportunities for job seekers in our local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Briggs and I toured stage 1 of the Central Coast Group Training jobs and skills centre at Tuggerah, which is nearing completion. As per our election commitment, this government will deliver $700,000 to complete the construction of this outstanding new jobs and skills centre with an additional $2 million commitment for the construction of a further training facility in the north of the electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the mother of two young men I understand the challenges faced by young people when they complete school and seek employment. Not all young people choose to go to university, and it is important that we support those who choose to undertake an apprenticeship or traineeship. The new jobs and skills centre in Dobell clearly demonstrates this government's determination to boost apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities available to job seekers on the Central Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister and I also visited Norah Head boat ramp, where we signed a funding agreement with Wyong Shire Council to deliver $700,000 to complete essential boat-ramp repairs and upgrading work. Norah Head is a major tourism area for the Central Coast and our investment in this vital piece of economic infrastructure will deliver better access for trailers and boats. The locals have welcomed this commitment. Not only is this welcomed by the local residents but also it will increase tourism numbers and support associated jobs in our tourism sector. What we are seeing in Norah Head is a lot more cafes opening up as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government understands the importance of investment in infrastructure and these projects clearly demonstrate that after six years of Labor the Central Coast will no longer miss out or be left behind. I would like to thank Minister Briggs for the taking the time to visit Dobell, to show the people of the Central Coast that this government is serious about delivering our election commitments and providing the essential infrastructure that our region desperately needs.</span>

On the Central Coast there is a very high level of youth unemployment and the actions of this government in cutting the support services to young people, to help them get jobs, is enormous. In this budget we have seen Youth Connections gone, and they provided a vital central service on the Central Coast. They will close on 30 June this year. </span>

                  </a>  It is interesting hearing the member taking credit for the jobs and skills training centre that was funded under the Labor government—quite a controversial project. It is really interesting to see the member standing up in this House taking credit for something that her side of parliament has absolutely nothing to do with. This budget is going to be really hard on young people. If they lose their jobs they will be there without any income support whatsoever.</span>

                  </a>  Right—go for it, member of Dobell, because the chair is not going to provide any protection whatsoever to me whilst I speak! Youth Connections on the Central Coast has provided a lot of support for young people, particularly for disadvantaged young people. Add to that the Schools Business Community Partnership Brokers Program, which fosters a whole-of-community approach to support young people as they learn and develop. It is something that the member to Dobell obviously does not support. I would also like to add that this government has ripped money out of the budget by moving away from the Australian Apprenticeships Access Program. Once again, this is something that the member for Dobell obviously does not support. </span>

It is not providing any support whatsoever to help them find jobs.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAUNDY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:44</span>):  I was delighted to join the Prime Minister and Premier Mike Baird last night at the final event for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">NewsLocal</span>'s Fair Go For The West campaign. I would like to congratulate Paul Whittaker and Brett Cleg from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> and Catherine Zule and her team from my <span style="font-style:italic;">NewsLocal</span>, the Inner West Courier. Together with my other Western Sydney colleagues it was wonderful to attend an event that showcased some of the best of the west.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The event held at Rooty Hill RSL club last night was a great occasion that provided an opportunity for us to celebrate everything that is great about Western Sydney, a part of the world that I have had the honour to call home my entire life. At the dinner the Prime Minister indicated that within this parliament we have several champions of the west—and I am honoured to count myself amongst them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The event was also a chance to recognise 13 hard-working Western Sydney champions, who were rewarded for their efforts in the region, with each receiving a $10,000 prize to allow their work to continue in the community. The winners came from across the spectrum, including from the areas of sport, business, tourism, education and community support services. This was appropriately reflective of the diverse, modern and rapidly-growing economy that is Western Sydney today. Australian cricket captain and Fair Go For The West ambassador Michael Clarke, was spot on when he praised the night's award winners and declared the region a hotbed of talent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, the onus is on us as elected representatives to put in place the right policies and deliver the investment in Western Sydney that will support its growth and people in the long term. We must deliver a fair go for the west. I am therefore thrilled to be part of a government that is doing just that. Our commitment to a second Sydney airport—or, as the Prime Minister said so aptly last night, 'a first airport for Western Sydney'—is just one of several major infrastructure projects this government has announced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The WestConnex road-building project within my electorate of Reid is one of Australia's largest transport infrastructure projects and will generate more than $20 billion worth of benefits to the Australian economy, while creating almost 10,000 jobs during the construction phase alone. We have committed more than $1.5 billion towards the WestConnex at stage 1, plus an additional concessional loan of up to $2 billion to accelerate construction of stage 2 by more than 18 months. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When this road is complete it will not only enable people within my electorate to travel east to west more efficiently; it will substantially improve traffic flows across the great divide in my electorate that is Parramatta Road. I championed both these projects in my maiden speech and I am delighted that both these projects are proceeding in the first term of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Sydney is an incredible part of the world, with incredible people, and I am absolutely determined that in my time here I will always work to ensure that we are given a fair go.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:47</span>):  The budget handed down by the Queensland LNP government yesterday, together with that of the Abbott coalition government in Canberra, shows that the coalition is not interested in jobs, in services or in cost-of-living issues faced by Queenslanders. The Abbott government has terminated the national partnership on certain concessions for pension concession card holders and seniors card holders, at a cost to the Queensland public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That will save the Abbott government $1.3 billion over four years. Tim Nicholls, the Queensland Treasurer, when he got up yesterday, made it clear that the Queensland government was cutting seniors' subsidies and concessions. This will make it even harder for Queenslanders. The cost of using public transport will be higher, your next power bills will be higher and your water bills will be higher, thanks to a combination of the Queensland LNP government in that state and the Abbott coalition government here in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They ignored the wishes of Queenslanders in terms of their LNP propaganda survey. They ignored the wishes of Queenslanders by proceeding with billions of dollars worth of asset sales, which will mean that householders will face even higher electricity prices, worse services and job losses as a priority is given to making profits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Campbell Newman promised he would get the unemployment rate down to four per cent. In fact, the Queensland budget yesterday tells us that the unemployment rate in Queensland is 5.25 per cent. In my area—the Ipswich and West Moreton region—it is 12.3 per cent. I look forward to hearing what the LNP members for Ipswich and Ipswich West have to say about the budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ipswich suffered as a result of this budget. We have seen the infrastructure spend in the Ipswich region go down by $318 million. I note in the Queensland LNP state budget yesterday that there was not a dollar—not a brass razoo—for the Darra to Rocklea section of the Ipswich motorway. They have opposed that upgrade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I give credit to the Abbott coalition government. They have matched our commitment in the budget of $279 million towards that final section of the Ipswich motorway, but they could not even get their colleagues and comrades in George Street to come up with their share to kick-start the project. The coalition opposed the upgrade of the Ipswich motorway from Dinmore to Darra when they were in power federally. We did it with $3 billion, but the federal government's mates in George Street will not lift a finger to do the final stage. They never talk about it down here in Canberra at all. We never see that wonderful Queenslander, the Deputy Prime Minister, ever talking about this vital project for all of South-East Queensland, including Brisbane and Ipswich.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="7K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ENTSCH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:50</span>):  I rise today to very strongly support a local artist in my region, Amanda Feher. Those who know me in this place know that I have a passion for the arts and supporting local artists. Anyone who has visited my office would be well aware that the walls are lined with pieces showcasing my region—a very colourful display! In recent times I have spoken about the JUTE Theatre Company, a fantastic local theatre company in Cairns. I have advocated to our arts minister, Senator Brandis, on behalf of KickArts Contemporary Arts. Also a habit of mine is that when I bring a new piece to Canberra I make sure I get a photo of it with the current Prime Minister. It gives the artist a real buzz knowing they have artwork hanging in the national parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That being the case, today I wold like to take the opportunity to mention a highly talented visual artist and good friend of mine, Amanda Feher. Locally born and bred, Amanda lives on the Atherton Tablelands and works in a range of mediums across both two- and three-dimensional art. Amanda's primary goal is to touch people with her work, and I can say that she is absolutely outstanding. From beautiful sculptures in copper and marble to landscapes, portraits and abstracts in charcoal, pastels, oils and acrylic, she has a touch that really brings lightness to any piece. I was quite humbled by a portrait she did of me back in the early 2000s,which won the local Cairns Art Society prize and was acquired by—would you believe it?—the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cairns Post</span>. It hung for a time in their boardroom. I am not sure it is there now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A real strength of Amanda's is public art—the large installations that she has done for council collections across Queensland. A giant copper and steel ant sculpture which she created for the Mighty Meat Ants football team at Augathella looks almost ready to come to life. Can you imagine it? It is 7.5 metres tall atop a wooden pole. At Dimbulah, she crafted an incredibly realistic two-metre high tobacco plant in copper as a legacy of the region's tobacco industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that Cairns is undergoing a period of revitalisation in the CBD, in time for the G20 finance meeting in September, I urge Cairns Regional Council to include significant pieces of street art and public art in their works. Certainly they need to take a close look at one of Amanda's creations. They could have a look at what councils in Townsville have done, for example, with some of Amanda's outstanding works. She did one for Jezzine Barracks, which opened recently. If you have a look at what the local council has done with the Esplanade in Cooktown, they have brought the history—Indigenous through to Chinese migration and mining—of the town alive with a whole series of magnificent street art. It really adds another dimension to public spaces. I would urge anyone who is interested to look at Amanda's work at www.amandafeher.com.au.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:53</span>):  Since the 1970s, multiculturalism has had an enormous impact on Australian society. We have seen migration from almost every corner of the globe. This has greatly shaped and influenced our nation, its identity and its values. My electorate of Fowler is very culturally diverse, with people coming from all over the globe. As a matter of fact, it is the most multicultural electorate in the country, with people coming from Serbia, Lebanon, China, Cambodia and Vietnam, amongst many other nations. It is a very vibrant community and I am very proud to represent it. I see firsthand the great and valuable contributions that people from all over the globe bring to our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the proposed amendments to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, in my view, would have a significant and adverse impact on the descendants of not only the first people of this country but also the many ethnic groups that have come to call Australia home. One of those groups is the Vietnamese, which is a community that makes up more than 20 per cent of my electorate. The Vietnamese community describes Australia as a 'multicultural, free and democratic nation'. It is these three values which are of great significance to the Vietnamese, who fled as refugees from the communist regime in the mid-seventies. Tania Huynh, a good friend of mine, grew up calling herself an Australian despite her obvious Vietnamese heritage. She was born and raised in Australia, and grew up eating meat pies. loving sport, and singing <span style="font-style:italic;">Waltzing Matilda</span>. Her parents came to Australia as refugees from the Vietnam War, in search of freedom and liberty. Along with many other ethnic families, they were given the opportunity to build a new life in Australia—a place that they could genuinely call home. Having been elected as a People of Australia Ambassador in 2013, Tania has pledged her commitment to the principles of a multicultural Australia. To Tania, repealing section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act will take away substantial gains which many multicultural organisations, and other committed supporters, have worked very hard to achieve over the years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's proposal does not threaten a specific identity but rather upsets the entire Australian community, bringing into debate their identity and their values. We know intimately the impact of racism on our people: it is hurtful, it is shameful, it undermines our sense of personal security and safety, and it alienates people from the broader community. Tania grew up being able to call herself an Aussie, while being proud of her Asian heritage. Every child deserves the right to be accepted and to feel proud of their cultural background. In saying that, Tania looks forward to an Australia which continues to build on multiculturalism, and which not only accepts but embraces immigrants to our shores. Therefore, the Attorney-General's view that 'people have a right to be bigots' has no place in Australia— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also had a visit to the electorate from the Deputy Prime Minister a fortnight ago, when we were very pleased to announce federal funds for the University of the Third Age, and funds of $2.8 million for the Port Macquarie Indoor Stadium expansion. We were pleased to hear that Port Macquarie-Hastings Council now has the construction certificate ready; all the federal funds are in place; the state funds are in place; and the whole community is looking forward to getting that project rolling.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the Deputy Prime Minister in town, we highlighted the huge wins for roads in the electorate of Lyne. As you know, Acting Deputy Speaker, in this budget we have allocated another $200 million available across Australia to the federal Black Spot program. We have also allocated $350 million in extra funding to the Roads to Recovery program. We also have the $300-million Bridge to Renewal Program in this budget. In the electorate of Lyne, which has over 1,000 kilometres of dirt road in the Hastings-Port Macquarie Council area and a similar mileage of roads that need work in the Greater Taree City Council area, I have encouraged both of those councils to apply to the Roads to Recovery program and to the Black Spot program for funding.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were also very pleased in this budget to have $8 million being released for The Buckets Way upgrade this year, a subsequent $8 million in next year's forward estimates for this project. The Buckets Way would have to be the most repaired patchwork of road in the electorate. It is the road that links Gloucester and the south-west of the electorate to the industrial area of Taree. If we can get that road fixed, it will improve travel times, and reduce damage to cars and to wheels—if I have had one person complain about a broken wheel due to potholes, I have had 10—the state of disrepair of this road is unbelievable.</span>

There will be 1,000 direct jobs and all those indirect jobs. This budget will be a great boost for the Lyne electorate, particularly the roads budget.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  As I was saying last night when debating these appropriation bills, I am delighted that, as part of this year's budget, we are going ahead with our community safety program to spend $300,000 on providing CCTVs in and around Darwin and Palmerston. CCTVs have delivered great benefits where they have been installed. They are invaluable tools in solving and preventing crime. I know that they will be embraced by the Solomon community. We will be enlisting help from the community during the selection process. I am actually in the process now of organising a committee that is made up of police, Neighbourhood Watch and some business groups to identify key hotspots around Darwin and Palmerston.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One really good element of the Safer Streets Program is that we are using money generated from proceeds of crime to tackle crime and the criminals who commit them. Unlike Labor, we deliver on our CCTV rollouts. This is one of a number of things that we have done since we have come to government to assist the Northern Territory Police in doing their job to make the streets of Darwin and Palmerston safer. In February immigration minister Scott Morrison visited Darwin to announce that the Commonwealth would spend $48 million to employ around 100 police officers to oversee the asylum seekers still based in the territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During my first term of parliament, back in the bad old days of opposition, I worked hard to achieve the best outcomes for Solomon should we win the 2013 election. When the people of Solomon put their faith in me last year for another term in Canberra I had already secured funding from my colleagues here in Canberra. One of the best promises our new government has made—and this one is close to my heart—is for the hospital for the people of Palmerston. I have lived in Palmerston for over 20 years and now my son, Aaron, and his wife, Amy, are raising their baby daughter, Evie, in Palmerston.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Providing a state-of-the-art hospital in Palmerston is a very personal wish not just for me but for thousands of others around the Top End. The $110 million for a hospital in Palmerston is a firm commitment from the Abbott government that they take very seriously developing north Australia. The Prime Minister said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These are important, tangible short-term commitments to the people of the north. We want to back that with a strategic vision that will help to make Northern Australia one of the great contributors to the extraordinary economic developments that we see to our north in our region in China, India and elsewhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia has travelled extensively throughout north Australia. I am proud to say that there was such overwhelming interest in the public hearings in Darwin that our committee has agreed to come back for a second visit in August to ensure that all Territorians get their voice heard in terms of north Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another display of the coalition's commitment to deliver for the people of Darwin and Palmerston is the record amount of spending on roads in the Territory. I welcome the coalition's investment in the Territory with the $90 million regional roads productivity package and the $77 million Northern Territory roads package announced in the federal budget. This comes on top of the $70 million already promised by the Abbott government to duplicate Tiger Brennan Drive, which was one of my election promises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget for 2014-15 is part of the government's economic action strategy to invest in productivity enhancing infrastructure which will create jobs, improve safety, reduce travel times and, most importantly, boost economic growth. This is $237 million to improve Territory roads. I worked in opposition and in government to have these important projects funded not just in Solomon but across the entire Northern Territory. The people of Lingiari also deserve increased road funding, even if their member was not effective in his advocacy to get that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout my time in opposition I had the opportunity to advocate for our local sporting clubs and secure funding for a variety of different projects that will get the children and adults in my electorate out and about and participating in sport. We recognise that local sport is an important aspect of the Top End community. Community sports organisations encourage a healthy and active lifestyle for both children and adults.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Jingili BMX Club just last weekend tried out their new all-weather track for the first time. The coalition provided $1.5 million worth of funding to ensure this project was finally delivered. Unfortunately, in true Labor style, the money was promised in 2010 but the Labor government did not action it until four weeks out from an election. I look forward to visiting the new track next month when it will be used in competition for the first time. This is fantastic news for Territory BMX riders, who can now ride all year long and host international standard tournaments and not be disadvantaged by the wet season.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Berrimah Riding Club is another great local organisation in my electorate. They will receive around $5,000 to construct a shade structure over their horse wash bays. Not only does this funding benefit Berrimah Riding Club; it also assists other organisations that uses the Robbie Robbins Reserve facility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The South Darwin Rugby League Football Club will receive $99,000 for much-needed upgrades to Warren Park, where a majority of the Northern Territory junior rugby league games are held on a Saturday morning. Upgrades to the park will include installation of a demountable for officials, roller door upgrades, construction and installation of removable shade structures, plumbing repairs, irrigation upgrades and field lights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this, the Palmerston Football Club will receive $8,700 toward construction of new locker rooms for players and the Darwin Table Tennis Association will receive $13,000 for the purchase of 15 internationally certified table tennis tables for competition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another key election issue in my electorate centred around the coalition's policy to stop the flow of asylum seeker boats into the Northern Territory. I am so pleased to be able to say we have delivered on that promise. We said before the election that we would stop the boats, and that is exactly what we have done. That is good governance—carrying out promises made before an election. This is what the coalition is all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am delighted in particular that this policy goal has been so quickly achieved. Overflowing detention centres in the electorate of Solomon meant an added burden on our healthcare system, emergency services and other social infrastructure, which I spoke about many times in this House. Those burdens did not please the people of Darwin and Palmerston. Sadly, people were dying trying to get to our country It was our Navy personnel who were tasked with pulling deceased bodies from the water when people-smuggling vessels sank. The only humane thing to do was to stop the boats. It was the only way to be fair both to Australian taxpayers and to desperate asylum seekers fleeing their countries.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, we announced that two of the Darwin detention centres would close down. This is a dividend of the coalition's policy to stop the boats. The Defence Establishment Berrimah and the Darwin Airport Lodge will cease operations this financial year. This will directly affect my constituents, with pressure easing on the Royal Darwin Hospital and other social infrastructure. As I said, this is just one example of how the coalition is mopping up the mess left behind by the Labor Party and it infuriates me that my constituents must now do all the heavy lifting for the Labor Party's laziness and irresponsible actions. The coalition government's budget is addressing the debt and deficit disaster left behind by the Australian Labor Party. This Labor Party's legacy is unsustainable and must not be allowed to continue. To fail to tackle the borrowing of $1 billion every month just to pay the interest is unsustainable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the coalition is used to cleaning up Labor's mess, it does not make it any easier. Nor is it fair on the hardworking Australian taxpayers. When the coalition last left office, Australia had a $20 billion surplus and $50 billion in the bank, but over six years Labor squandered this and ran up five record deficits, $123 billion in projected deficits and gross debt heading towards $667 billion. The measures outlined in this year's budget are absolutely necessary so that we can secure Australia's economic future, and the tough decisions we are taking now are necessary to avoid even tougher decisions having to be made in the future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="TK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr SOUTHCOTT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  I am pleased to speak on this budget, which begins the important task of repairing the Commonwealth budget and delivering a credible pathway back to surplus. Consider where we were in 2007: we had an unemployment rate of four per cent, no government debt, we had budgets in surplus. When the Labor government left office six years later, they left us with 200,000 more unemployed, gross debt projected to rise to $667 billion, $123 billion in cumulative deficits and the world's biggest carbon tax. This budget is an important step in fixing up that mess.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see with repairing the budget is that we have a pathway back to surplus in 2018-19 and budget surpluses to build to well over one per cent of GDP by 2024-25. Rather than the debt of $667 billion, which was projected in 2013-14, in 10 years' time the debt will be $389 billion—almost $300 billion less. This decline in debt is equivalent to $10,100 per Australian. By repairing the budget, Australia will have lower debt and lower interest costs. The interest on government debt is projected to be $16 billion lower in a decade, meaning more money for health, education, roads and support for families and seniors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two parts of the budget that I would really like to focus on. The first is the infrastructure. The budget will create an $11.6 billion Infrastructure Growth Package. This is important to unlock growth, unlock productivity in our economy and to boost the total infrastructure investment by Commonwealth, state and local governments, as well as the private sector, to over $125 billion by the end of this decade—or the equivalent of eight Snowy Mountains schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Boothby, finally we are going to see work commence on South Road. The RAA, the key motoring organisation in South Australia, has long had a vision of a north-south road corridor, going from Darlington in the south to Wingfield in the north and connecting with the Southern Expressway in the south and the Northern Expressway in the north. So we are finally seeing action on South Road at Darlington. This announcement has been welcomed by my constituents who have expressed their appreciation now that this project is finally going ahead. It is great news for local traffic, and it will create jobs, which will help the South Australian economy in the future. As a focal point of the federal budget there was an extra $441 million in funding allocated to South Australia for upgrades to South Road, taking the total federal contribution to almost $1 billion and allowing both the Darlington and Torrens to Torrens upgrades to be constructed simultaneously. I want to pay credit to the Prime Minister and also to the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, Steven Marshall, who realised, rather than a stand-off between one project and the other, indeed, why not do both.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The upgrades at Darlington are what I have been fighting for on behalf my constituents since 2007. These upgrades have been promised since 2006 by the Labor Party who have failed to deliver. In the last seven years Labor have spruiked for South Road at Sturt Road a tunnel, an underpass, a flyover, an interchange and a widening of South Road. None of these projects have been delivered. In this year's budget we are delivering on our election commitment to build the Darlington interchange by funding 80 per cent of the overall project through our Infrastructure Growth Package. The upgrades will mean free-flowing traffic from the end of the Southern Expressway to Daws Road. In addition, the project contains much needed improvement to the Marion Road and Sturt Road intersection. These infrastructure projects will create much needed opportunities for South Australian contractors and will bring our infrastructure into the 21st century. Adelaide, I think, has had the poorest infrastructure of any mainland capital city, but completion of the north-south road corridor should see that rectified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The major South Road upgrades at Darlington are scheduled to be finished by 2018. It is planned to construct a lowered road to the west of South Road that will extend the Southern Expressway free-flowing carriageways to a point north of the South Road-Ayliffes Road intersection. Flinders Drive will be extended to connect through to Sturt Road allowing local traffic to Flinders University and the Flinders Medical Centre to be unimpeded. There will be upgrades to the remaining South Road intersections, that is, connection to the Southern Expressway, Flinders Drive, Sturt Road, Ayliffes Road and the entrance to the Tonsley Park. As I said before, the intersection of Marion Road and Sturt Road will be widened, and there is also going to be some work done on South Road through Edwardstown near Castle Plaza to cater for the morning peak-hour traffic. They are looking at an extra northbound lane on South Road. So there will be some widening there. Early works should begin later this year, with heavy roadworks to commence next year. The entire project is to be completed by 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased to be with the Prime Minister, the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure, the member for Mayo, and the Premier of South Australia and the transport minister for South Australia, Stephen Mullighan, touring the Traffic Management Centre in Norwood and having a look at what the project at Darlington will look like. It really is one of the key measures for my electorate and a complete delivery of what we committed to at the election. In addition, there is money for Roads to Recovery funding. South Australian councils will receive twice as much funding. I also encourage local councils to apply for funding under the expanded Black Spot program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other key measure in the budget that I wanted to talk about was the Medical Research Future Fund. This is a landmark initiative. It really is a nation-building initiative for the 21st century. Before the election we said one of the key things we would do would be to back our strengths. Medical research is one of the strengths, and it is going to be one of the future drivers for the economy. So to have a capital fund building up to $20 billion will allow an income stream in perpetuity for medical research. It is a significant expansion of medical research funding in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of South Australia the SAHMRI—the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute—is well positioned to capitalise on this. It has been the named 'the cheese grater' or 'the pineapple' and it came about as a result of the <span style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eview of health and medical research in South Australia</span> which was conducted by Professor John Shine AO and Mr Alan Young AM, who recommended the establishment of a dedicated flagship research institute for South Australia. South Australia being a small state, we had three different universities all competing against each other; but what we really needed was one flagship research institute. With the new Royal Adelaide Hospital and the University of Adelaide medical school moving to the same precinct, this co-location will build on South Australia's impressive contribution to medical research and innovation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his opening speech last November the Prime Minister specifically mentioned the work of two Nobel prizewinners for medicine, Dr Robin Warren and Lord Howard Florey, who are both graduates of the University of Adelaide medical school. He said that Lord Florey was possibly the greatest Australian ever for his contribution in developing penicillin for wider use. He also paid tribute to the work of the previous government and spoke of the importance of medical research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the new SAHMRI, South Australia has the potential to develop a biotech precinct in the North Terrace area, in the same way that Parkville in Melbourne is a long established biotech precinct and Brisbane has become one. This is an opportunity to build on our existing strengths—our renowned excellence in research and clinical trials but we need to foster a climate where that can occur. That is why the Medical Research Future Fund is so important. It will see people come to Australia from overseas as a destination of choice to do their postdoctoral research and build their careers in medical research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The executive director Steve Wesselingh has already assembled an impressive group of individuals. We have seen people return from overseas, like Professor Prash Sanders, working in the area of heart health, and Dr Charles Mullighan, heading up the research theme in cancer. These are people who could have had a research career anywhere in the world but have chosen to return to Adelaide because of the facilities that are on offer. SAHMRI has established seven research themes: Aboriginal health; cancer; healthy mothers; babies and children; heart health; infection and immunity; mind and brain; and nutrition and metabolism. It will be a significant development in the landscape in South Australia but it is important that we have the Medical Research Future Fund to provide certainty for medical research into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">SAHMRI is building a team of more than 600 outstanding researchers who are working together in the search for better treatments and cures. It is creating a world-class precinct of medical research and clinical application adjacent to the site of the new Royal Adelaide Hospital. These are just two of the important developments for my electorate in the budget and we need to have the Medical Research Future Fund adequately funded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a landmark initiative. I pay credit to the Minister For Health who has long wanted to make medical research a signature of his time as minister. It really builds on the theme that it has been Liberal governments that have been the great friends of medical research in this country. We well remember all the times the previous Treasurer tried to strip hundreds of millions of dollars from the medical research budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Medical Research Future Fund will build to a level of $20 billion; it will then be the largest medical research fund in the world. It will provide income of over $1 billion and it is important, seeing what Labor did with some of these other future funds, that we have a structure like the Future Fund so the Labor Party cannot raid the capital and spend it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are the two initiatives I wanted to speak on. The South Road development will now be underway. I do pay credit to the South Australian government, because they have actually come up with an improved proposal for Darlington. It is improved from what was originally in the Darlington Transport Study, and it will be great news for residents of the south. South Road-Sturt Road has been one of the major bottlenecks and major hold-ups in traffic, so this will be a welcome development by the time it is finished in 2018. Similarly, the Medical Research Future Fund is going to be very important, right across Australia. SAHMRI is a new institution but is well poised to benefit from that fund.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="E07" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARKUS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:25</span>):  I rise to speak on the budget appropriation bills for 2014-15 and related bills. The federal budget handed down in May recognises that our nation is indeed at a crossroads. It recognises that there are clear, hard choices to be made if we want to get Australia back on track. The test is that after six years of the waste, excessive spending and poor choices made by the former government, our nation has been drowning in a spiral of debt and deficit that is not sustainable. The bills before the parliament today show a clear plan to build a strong and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia. Those are not just catchphrases or words, they are a vision for what those on this side of the House see for our future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government is committed to an Australia that is strong, that is prosperous, that is growing and that is providing opportunities for all Australians no matter what age, race, gender or background. Although some tough decisions have been made, these decisions are what will best place our nation to meet the challenges ahead. Like many members of the House, I remember well the fiscal position we had established during the last days of the Howard government. This did not happen by chance or accident. When we left office in 2007 there was $20 billion in surplus and money in the bank, money in the bank to invest in this nation. In an unprecedented six years Labor turned nearly $50 billion in the bank into projected net debt well over $200 billion. This is the fastest deterioration in debt, in dollar terms and as a share of GDP, in modern Australian history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is disappointing that I have not heard or seen any evidence of the other side of this House taking responsibility for what they took us to. One figure that astounds me is the fact that, because of Labor's mismanagement, we are now paying more than $1 billion per month in net interest payments. If left unchecked, that would be $2.8 billion a month in 10 years time. That is staggering and shameful. One billion dollars could do so much for the electorate of Macquarie. An additional crossing, for example, over the river which would ease the traffic congestion and challenges faced by many in my community is just one of the many road projects that we could invest in if we did not have to pay that debt. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although there have been tough decisions made in this budget, many of the residents I have talked to in Macquarie understand that—just like a household managing a budget—we cannot afford to keep borrowing to pay $1 billion a month in interest. It is like a household paying a mortgage on the credit card. We have a difficult task at hand but the coalition government is up to the challenge. I will focus on some of the reforms within this budget that take us forward as a nation. I will also talk to some of the specific funding and investment, particularly infrastructure, for the electorate of Macquarie and indeed for Greater Western Sydney. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within this budget is an historic amount of spending on infrastructure that will get our nation moving. In New South Wales alone there is a record $14.9 billion in funding. Crucial to this electorate is the Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan, which will have a significant impact on Greater Western Sydney, the larger Sydney and, of course, all surrounding regions of Sydney. It includes $2.9 billion for road transport upgrades to service Sydney's second airport to be developed at Badgerys Creek. For the first time in a long time the infrastructure spend on roads will happen before we establish the airport. Building the right road infrastructure to support Badgerys Creek will benefit not just airport users but residents throughout Macquarie, many of whom already travel long distances to get to work. That additional investment will add to the tourism dollar and benefit people movements, particularly in communities in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The upgrade to the Northern Road-Bringelly Road and the $200 million local roads package will relieve pressure on existing infrastructure and release the economic capacity of the region by easing congestion and helping to create local jobs. By working with the New South Wales government we are delivering an unprecedented amount of funding for the future of New South Wales. We made a commitment to the people of Greater Western Sydney that building roads and vital infrastructure would be of utmost priority, and this budget is proof of that. Greater Western Sydney, including the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, can no longer afford to be left behind in infrastructure. We are getting on with the job of investing for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also pleased that we are working to deliver some key infrastructure for my local area. Within this budget is important funding that has been committed to ensure completion of a number of important projects in the region. There is a package of priority safety upgrades to the Greater Western Highway between Katoomba and Lithgow. We will see the injection of $173.5 million of federal funds over the next four years. I was able to announce this funding last week with the local state member for the Blue Mountains, Roza Sage, and look forward to working with the community and the state member to deliver this as a priority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a $3 million federal contribution to the M4 managed motorway. This includes planning works for a managed motorway system on the M4 from Merrylands to Lapstone in the Lower Blue Mountains. There is a federal contribution of $18 million for the upgrade of the approach routes to the Richmond Bridge and associated intersections in the Hawkesbury. This $18 million will be rolled out over the next three years. The local state member and I are working closely with the New South Wales government to deliver this. This has been fought for over a number of years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, federal funds of $4.4 million for 2014-15 have been committed for the Springwood town centre revitalisation. These funds will enable the completion of what is a very important project for the local community. The new Springwood Civic Centre and precinct will be valuable community assets for future generations in Springwood and indeed across the mountains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within this budget are also some very exciting and worthwhile measures that will assist young people, who are indeed the future of our nation. There are some changes to higher education that will benefit young people, particularly those in my community. I am particularly pleased about the historic Commonwealth support for students studying higher education diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degree courses as well as those studying bachelor degrees. This is in addition to the announcement that we will establish a Commonwealth scholarship scheme to assist access for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. These measures recognise that higher education is not a one size fits all. We want to ensure that no young person is left behind and that all young people are given the opportunity to study and learn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe all young people should be learning or earning. I was pleased to announced last week that suburbs in Macquarie are part of the first 18 areas to be rolled out under phase 1 of the new Work for the Dole program. This will provide young people with opportunities. This will provide them with incentives. This will provide them with self-esteem-building and confidence-building activities and an opportunity to develop skills. From 1 July 2014, 18- to 30-year-olds in Macquarie who have been unemployed for 12 months or more and receiving Newstart and/or youth allowance will be required to do work for the dole in 2014-15. The government's reinvigorated Work for the Dole program will give all participants a chance to have a go. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government firmly believes that all Australians capable of working should be working. They should be earning, learning or engaging in programs like Work for the Dole. Work for the Dole is an important part of our plan to help young job seekers gain skill and experience that they need to move from Welfare to Work, to make a positive contribution to their local community and to also have a sense of their value and worth. It keeps job seekers engaged and active as well as giving them an opportunity to get involved in local initiatives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike those opposite, we do not want to see our young people fall into the trap of a lifetime of welfare dependency when they have the capacity to work and/or study. We believe in the potential of the next generation and what they have to offer but we also recognise that sometimes our young people need a bit of encouragement and an incentive to achieve their dreams and their goals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to highlight the key election commitments that this budget delivers for the people of Macquarie. I am thrilled that this budget contains a total of $15 million for the Greater Western Sydney conservation corridor—something that I have been fighting and working towards for about a decade. This includes $7.5 million in direct funding for the acquisition of threatened land in the Cumberland Conservation Corridor. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This commitment is something that myself, along with the Minister for the Environment, the member for Lindsay, and others are deeply committed to and also excited about. It will be a major boost for the conservation of the area and provide a once-in-a-generation opportunity to establish a conservation corridor which will be preserved for future generations. It is a recognition of the importance of protecting the green areas within and around our cities, particularly in Greater Western Sydney and the conversation value of the Cumberland Plain woodlands. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2014-15 federal budget also included funding under the coalition government's Safer Streets Program where proceeds of crime will be directed to fund local, prime-preventing crime projects, including $150,000 for closed-circuit television cameras for Richmond; $300,000 for closed-circuit television cameras for Blaxland and Wentworth Falls; $30,000 for closed-circuit television cameras for the Hazelbrook pedestrian overpass; and $30,000 for closed-circuit television cameras for Peter Carroll Field in Leura. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This $510,000 investment to improve security in the local communities is a welcome announcement for small business owners in particular who often bear the brunt of vandalism and theft. I have already met with the local council and have spoken to local police and the various community organisations that will be involved in the rollout of this initiative. I look forward to the end result, which will provide a safer community for all. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also relevant to the electorate of Macquarie is $15 million in the 2014-15 federal budget for the creation of a national bushfire mitigation program. This commitment we made at the election is fully funded, ensuring no additional pressure on the budget. This program is a targeted initiative to reduce the impact of bushfires and build a more disaster-resilient Australia. Too many times Australians have witnessed bushfires that devastate Australian communities and business—and in fact for many, who would be aware, we have faced this firsthand in the Blue Mountains most recently but also in the Hawkesbury and a number of regions that are close to our communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national bushfire mitigation program will see the Commonwealth partner with states and territories to build upon their existing fire management practices and implement strategies to address risks. This program will better equip communities to be able to prevent and, if needed, withstand the impacts and effects of bushfires. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this budget, the Abbott government has reduced the Labor deficits by $43.8 billion through to 2017-18. This budget is about a shift from spending to contributing, and from the short term to the long term. We are working to create a sustainable future for the next generations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During my former career as a social worker, I observed all too often the knock-on effects for a family when a person was stuck in a lifestyle of welfare dependency. I also observed that it was often when a Labor government was in power that people would walk through my doors needing assistance and support that should never have walked through those doors. Compassion for those less fortunate and a safety net for the vulnerable are paramount, but what is also paramount is giving people the opportunity to contribute and build.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a land of great opportunity but we need to allow people to pursue those opportunities and their own dreams. Repairing the budget is a key part of our economic strategy to build a strong prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia. There is nothing more relevant to supporting the vulnerable, pensioners, job creation, education, health and infrastructure, than a strong economy. We must ask ourselves: are we prepared to let the budgetary position continue to deteriorate so that we leave a growing mountain of debt to our children, or are we prepared to rein it in now so that we can have a strong and prosperous future? I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="208884" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PORTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:40</span>):  Having witnessed for the first time personally, from inside federal parliament, the Commonwealth budget unfold, I must say it is an experience that I will not soon forget. The scale of what occurs and the immediacy of the effects on people's lives, and the long-run effect on all Australians of both action and inaction in a federal budget makes it a task of immense responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be personally involved in even the most peripheral or modest way is, again, an experience of some learning. I just want to commence by thanking the Minister for Finance for seeking from me some research on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Smaller and More Rational Government </span>ministerial paper, which I was very happy to conduct and provide. When assessing the quality of any public policy, particularly an economic policy such as a budget, the assessment must logically commence with an assessment of the nature of the problem, if any, that is sought to be solved. It has occurred to me as rather unusual that the debate about what problem might exist occurred in Australia over the period of perhaps six weeks in the lead-up to the budget and in the early stages after the budget's release. It seemed, to me at least, that that was probably a debate and a conversation that could have occurred for at least six months, because in my observation the scale of the problem is significant and its nature is complicated in the detail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But if you understand the nature of a problem you are at least offered the starting point to assess whether the type of solution being offered is fit for the purpose. If you understand the scale of a problem you have some hope of having revealed to you whether the scale of the response is sufficient, whether it is excessive, or whether it is insufficient. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my observation the simplest description of the problem that is now facing Australia economically is that it is a compound problem. The problem is neither debt nor deficit in isolation; it is a very large debt, which will grow if there is no further action, running in parallel with historically large deficits. Perhaps that can be restated at its core as a structural expenditure problem in the Australian public finances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The figures are well established and they have been put here many times. In 2007, Australia had $50 billion, in effect, in assets in the bank; a $20 billion surplus. That was turned very rapidly into the five largest deficits in Australia's history, at $193 billion cumulative—$123 billion worth of prospective cumulative deficits to 2016-17 if no action were taken; and projected debt, if no action were taken, of $667 billion. It really shows what a massive task was undertaken in the Howard-Costello government to leave Australia's public finances in the state they were in in 2007.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to that problem two views have emerged, in that six-week debate, about the scale and nature of the problem. The first view is simply that this problem—the debt and deficit problem, the structural expenditure problem—is not a problem of immediate significance. I would generously ascribe that as the view that the Labor opposition appears to hold. I will simply, for the sake of brevity, describe that as the defer-the-solution view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second view is slightly more extreme—or, maybe, substantially more extreme. It is the view that the idea that a problem exists in Australia's public finances is deliberately confected to allow for a range of policies to be enacted which have an ideological base rather than a pragmatic or practical base in terms of solving an actual or real problem. That is the view that is clearly offered and subscribed to by members of the Palmer United Party. It is clearly the view offered and subscribed to by members of the Greens. There are some academics that have put that view—one particularly from the University of New South Wales, who I will make mention of shortly. Again, generously, I will attribute to Labor a view that there is a problem but that the solution should be deferred because the scale or quantum of the problem is not as it is being portrayed by the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow Treasurer on a number of occasions in my observation, particularly in question time, has acknowledged that tough decisions will have to be made, which appears to acknowledge that there is a problem—although what those tough decisions might be or when they might occur is certainly less clear from the opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I am correct in generously ascribing a view to Labor that they see a problem but would prefer to defer the solution, the very interesting question that arises is: if you think that the problem is not so substantive that the solution should be immediate but rather deferred, why would you promise 500 times in your time in government to produce a surplus? Why should the problem be deferred now but not when you were in government? That is a very significant shift in rhetoric. I think it reveals some difficulties in the policy position of the opposition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might just make a comment about the second view, which is that the problem is entirely confected, that it simply does not exist and has been invented for some scurrilous ideological purpose. Again, there was an academic, who I will talk about shortly, from the University of New South Wales who said, in effect, that the debts and the deficit, not even large-scale or even running in tandem, are not a problem but that productivity is the problem. The difficulty with that analysis is that it completely ignores the link between increased debt and increased interest payments and decreased capital investment on the part of government. Continuing debt and deficit and growing interest payments on debt seriously imperil productivity because they seriously constrain government's ability to invest in capital infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is illustrated by looking at the interest bill that has been spoken of a number of times. There is presently $12 billion of interest a year and $1 billion interest a month. It has been said that that could purchase each and every month a very substantially sized teaching hospital in every capital city in Australia. Over the course of the year, that $12 billion represents something close to half of the total recurrent expenditure of the Defence budget of Australia. Indeed, from my previous experience, it appears almost unfathomable to me that $12 billion a year in interest payments is approaching half the expenditure of the entire state government of Western Australia. So with the interest bill of the Commonwealth in a year you could run half of the entire state of Western Australia. It shows the gargantuan nature of the interest and debt problem that we have at the moment. Again, I think the idea that the problem is confected fundamentally misunderstands the link between the state of the public accounts and growth and productivity in the economy at large.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that the problem is confected relies on a comparison between Australia's debt as a percentage of GDP and other OECD countries. There are several problems with that comparison. It makes immensely problematic a seamless move from the comparison being favourable to the conclusion that no problem exists and nothing needs to be done. There are four problems with the comparison. The first is that the comparison of Commonwealth debt does not take into account an accumulation of federal government debt, state debt and household debt. If you have a look at Commonwealth debt, you are looking at about 13 per cent as a percentage share of GDP. When you combine state and federal debt, that is about a 29 per cent share of GDP. Secondly, the comparison takes no account of Australia's position as a trading economy. I think David Murray said it best when he said that, as a seller of commodities, Australia 'is a price taker whereas we have a high fixed cost in our budget, mostly in welfare, which is now up to 100 per cent of the personal tax take.' In effect, what he is saying is that we cannot afford public debt and we are borrowing to fund recurrent expenditure, particularly transfer payments and welfare payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third problem with the comparison is that it takes no account of the speed with which the debt arose, which is a matter that I will move on to in a moment. Fourthly, having taken no account of the speed with which the debt arose, it takes no account of the spending trajectory that Australia is now placed on unless very serious remedial action is taken. So the comparison of Australia's debt as a percentage of GDP with other OECD nations underestimates the problem. It ignores entirely where the problem will be at in two years, four years or six years time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to look at comments from the Parliamentary Budget Office—in essence, an invention of the opposition designed to be entirely independent of the political process. The head of that organisation has said: 'If you just continued on the trajectory of payments and revenues prior to the budget, net debt is forecast to grow rapidly … at the highest'—growth—'rate in the OECD. … I don’t think that’s a fiction at all.' So you have the fastest deterioration in debt as a percentage of GDP in Australia's history; you have $1 billion in interest payments per month—which could become $2.8 billion in a decade, if nothing is done; you have the PBO noting that debt is growing at the highest rate in the OECD; and you have interest payments which in 2024 could, without remedial action, be $30 billion. That is, interest payments in 2024 could be the size of the defence budget, or the size of the entire current budget of a state such as Western Australia. And that is unfathomable. This seriously constrains the ability of any government who inherits it to invest in infrastructure and improve productivity. Again from Mr Bowen at the PBO: 'It is time to start coming out'—of debt and deficit—'otherwise the longer you leave it, the more exposed you become and the harder it is to wind it back.' That is an observation which I think is pertinent. The longer we delay in fixing the budget, the higher the costs will be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we pause here for a moment, before moving to the nature of the problem, and consider one other thing said by David Murray—who I think is an excellent commentator on these matters—which I alluded to earlier. He said, 'we have a high fixed cost in our budget, mostly in welfare, which is now up to 100 per cent of the personal tax take.' So the welfare transfer payments represent 100 per cent of the personal tax take in Australia—every dollar that is taken from individuals in Australia through tax is spent, and then some, on welfare and transfer payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final matter I want to deal with is the accusation in this budget that the burden falls most heavily on those who can least afford it. In a trivial sense, that observation is understandable but, in a profound sense, it is incorrect and false, because it does not comprehend properly the nature of the problem—that is, it is not that we do not tax people enough in Australia; the nature of the problem is that we as a government, in the public accounts, are spending too much money. And largely, it is that we are spending too much money on transfer payments and entitlements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me put it this way: seven per cent of the population earn between $101,000 and $163,000; two per cent of the population earn between $164,000 and $264,000; one per cent—a tiny per cent of the population—earn over $265,000, and—moving backwards—14 per cent earn between $71,000 and $100,000. That is, 24 per cent of the Australian population earn over $71,000. They are paying 66 per cent, or two-thirds, of the tax. When you have the problem we have in Australia at the moment, which is, essentially, that the gulf between our expenditure and our tax take—our revenues—is large, and without remedial action will grow, then you have two essential options open to you in the public finances. One is to extract more revenue from the economy, which is to say, to tax people more; the other is to curtail your expenditure. And the expenditure comes, largely, in entitlements and transfer payments. Another way of looking this is to say that the lowest-earning 20 per cent of the population in Australia receive 40 per cent of all the income transfer payments, or welfare, and—quite properly; which is admirable in the Australian economy—the highest-earning 20 per cent of income earners get three per cent of the income transfers. So, if you accept that the difficulty is in expenditures, it is very hard to take benefits from the top 20 per cent of taxpayers who, in essence, do not receive benefits. That leaves you with only one other option—even a deferred option, which is what the opposition propose—and that is to find further sources of revenue. And I for one think that, whilst this budget has some further sources of revenue, it does go far enough and it should go no further. People are already giving major amounts of their wages to revenue. The problem is not that they do not give enough or that the taxpayers do not give enough; the problem is that we are spending too much.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might just finish then by saying this: the UNSW academic who I spoke of said: 'No problem. Imagine you were running the University of New South Wales business school, the Australian School of Business, where you had growing revenues and growing student enrolments, but you nevertheless were spending far more than you were earning in the business school, and you had a massive debt and were thereby borrowing to fund that debt. Would you not sit down and have a crisis meeting at the business school?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope the UNSW academic I have discussed is only teaching finance and not actively engaged in the finances of that business school, because Australia is at a point of crisis in the pathological sense of the term: we are at the stage of the disease where things will either get better and we will live, or things will get worse and we will wither.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this budget, though, there will be significant capital investment: three very major road projects in, or near to, my electorate. I am very thankful for them and for the government's decision to undertake them.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SCOTT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  It is wonderful to be here again today in the Federation Chamber to discuss Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015 and related bills. In 2007, when the coalition left office, they left behind $50 billion of gross national savings in the bank. Today we see the wreckage of the previous Labor government as far as the eye can see, and this occurred in six years. After just six years, the legacy that this Labor Party left Australia was 200,000 more unemployed; a gross debt projected to rise to $667 billion; $123 billion in cumulative deficits; and the world's biggest carbon tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor left the Australian people with a national debt costing a billion dollars a month in interest payments alone. Think of this: in just one month—one month alone—we could expand Mulgoa Road, from Glenmore Park through to the council chambers, to six lanes and still have the best part of $300,000 left over. Can you imagine? It would do so much for all the mums and dads relying on our local infrastructure if we could decongest our local roads. Under the Labor Party the jobless queues grew by 200,000. That is more than the entire population of Penrith.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian public has spoken. So have the people of Lindsay, the electorate I represent, and they demand a government that will get the budget under control, repeal the carbon tax—something the Labor Party is yet to admit needs to happen—and build the roads and infrastructure of the 21st century. The Abbott government is well on its way to achieving this objective. For the most part, the people I represent understand tough decisions must be made. Indeed, during the election, I doorknocked more than 30,000 houses. Overwhelmingly, these hardworking families want to see a government that is fiscally responsible. They want to see a government that will get the budget back under control—a government that will stop the waste and start investing in the infrastructure and the services that our community really needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to note that this budget will do that and I would like to congratulate the Treasurer on delivering his responsible economic action plan. Following the budget, and this week, I have travelled right across my electorate. My team and I visited every single train station, every morning, to talk to local commuters. We went to the markets. We went festivals. We pounded the pavement. We made sure we listened to as many people in the community as we possibly could before coming back to parliament for this sitting block. I wanted the residents of Lindsay to have an opportunity to speak directly—to talk about their concerns or the things they were really excited about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What makes me most proud is being the member for Western Sydney. I look at the great legacy that being the member for Western Sydney brings. Some say our nation was built on the sheep's back; the seat of Macarthur, where John Macarthur first had his sheep, is to my south. The early colony also had the five Macquarie towns. We were an agricultural region; we grew through that. In Western Sydney we have a lot of manufacturing. We have grown through that as a nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we are looking to the next generation. We have just come through the mining boom and we are looking at where we are going to invest further. Western Sydney is the third-largest economy in our country. I am so proud to be part of a government that believes in the people of Western Sydney, a government that is going to invest in the people of Western Sydney, a government that—together with its state colleagues—is going to invest $3.5 billion, over 10 years, in major road and infrastructure projects across Western Sydney. This will ease congestion, slash travel times and create thousands of local jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken regularly about the challenges my community face in commuting every day to work. Two-thirds of my community have to commute every single day—one-third all the way to the city and one-third to Greater Western Sydney. We need local jobs and we need them now, and we finally have a government that is prepared to take the heavy lifting and make it happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This investment will include an additional $1.5 billion plus a concessional loan of up to $2 billion to build the WestConnex motorway—linking Western and south-western Sydney with the city, Sydney Airport and port precincts—and a further $2 billion in concessional loans to get this project delivered faster. There is $2.9 billion from the federal government for the Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan, which will feature $35 million for a road extension, in Jane Street, in my electorate. There is $2.4 million of planning for stage 1 of the Werrington arterial between the M4 and the Great Western Highway at Claremont Meadows, the upgrade of the Northern Road to a minimum of four lanes from Narellan to the M4 and the upgrade of Bringelly Road to a minimum of four lanes from Camden Valley Way to the Northern Road. The contracts are already out to tender, and the project for Bringelly Road will start within the next few months. We will be improving interchanges that connect the Northern Road and the new motorway with arterial roads and there is a $200 million local-roads package that will go to decongesting local roads. This is overwhelmingly positive and fabulous news for Western Sydney. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night I was with the Prime Minister and many community leaders at Rooty Hill RSL. Western Sydney is excited—Western Sydney is ready to go—and it is great to see my area so pumped and charged for what the future will bring. I would like to impress upon the House the value we will get from this investment. It will make a genuine difference to the lives of the people I represent. Speaking of value, I want to highlight the cost—$1.5 billion—to build WestConnex. That is a month and a half of current interest payments we are making paying back on Labor's debt. Imagine how we could better spend the interest payments we are making. Think of the roads we could build. Think of the ports. Think of all the other infrastructure and health precincts we could work towards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate has been chosen as one of the starting points for Work for the Dole. Last week the Assistant Minister for Employment, the member for Cowper, announced that the Nepean region would be one of 18 areas to benefit from the Abbott government's new Work for the Dole arrangements for young job seekers. In the Nepean Valley, 18- to 30-year-olds who have been unemployed for 12 months or more and who are receiving Newstart or youth allowance would be required to work for the dole. Work for the Dole has been very successful in Lindsay over the years. Many people who enjoy the river-run would know that on the western bank of the Nepean River there is a sign from when the Howard government built the running track on that western path. This is a community asset that our community love and use. We walk our dogs there and we take our families there. We are able to showcase our beautiful Nepean River. The Work for the Dole program under the Howard government also worked on bank regeneration of the Tench Reserve site. This had massive replanting programs and saved the Tench Reserve site's banks from collapsing through erosion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the sorts of projects that we will once again see in our local area. In fact, the work done on this river precinct has been so helpful to the community that now the state government is having to build a $20 million Green Bridge to finish the whole lap, to provide another crossing for the Nepean River. As the Treasurer said on budget night:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…to build a workforce for the future, those who can work, should work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The benefit of work goes far beyond your weekly pay packet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Work gives people a sense of self, and work helps to build a sense of community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is exactly what we have seen under the Work for the Dole program previously in the Lindsay electorate. This has been welcomed by the community in Lindsay. Work for the Dole is an important part of the government's plan to help young job seekers gain the skills and experience they need to move from welfare to work and make a positive contribution to our local community. It keeps job seekers engaged and active and helps avoid a lifetime of welfare dependency. Indeed, I recall, under the previous programs, so many of these wonderful initiatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to draw to your attention today, Madam Deputy Speaker, to the fact that Lindsay is the fourth youngest electorate. We have a median age of just 34. When we look across our region, supporting our kids in our community is absolutely crucial. I am proud to see that once again we are supporting our kids: providing them with a future, giving them sport to play, giving them interaction and, once again, building the bedrock of our community. We will be seeing under the Hunter fields at Emu Plains at Emu Plains lighting upgrades of $20,000. At Jamison Park we will see $90,000 upgrades to shade cloths and canteens. Andromeda Oval at Cranebrook will see an upgrade of $25,500. Greygums Reserve will have a $60,000 upgrade of turf. Andrews Road Baseball Complex at Cranebrook will have a $26,000 safety fence. Hickeys Park playing surface will receive $45,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my proudest announcements is $12 million for the Western Sydney Community and Sports Centre. I like to think of this facility as a bit of a Western Sydney institute of sport. In essence, it will be an indoor rugby league field on a timber sprung floor. At this point in time, once it is constructed, it will be the second biggest exhibition space in New South Wales, but once Darling Harbour comes online it will be the third biggest. So it will be Darling Harbour, Homebush and then the Western Sydney Community and Sports Centre. It already has a mass of support right across our community from the Panthers teams through UWS to the Scouts and the PCYC. This will be an amazing facility. We have the disability sports getting online and all the other sports across our region that will get involved with this amazing project. I think, once again, it shows vision. It shows future. It shows believing in the people of Western Sydney—a region which is, as I stated earlier, the third biggest economy in our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Being a young community, the Paid Parental Leave scheme will be an amazing initiative for my electorate. Can you imagine being a mum commuting every single day for work? I have had to see friends and constituents of mine put babies into day care or leave them with parents or grandparents at three months of age. Having a fair Paid Parental Leave scheme that supports women getting back into the workforce is crucial. Could you imagine commuting 45 minutes, an hour or an hour and a half every single day away from your young infant children? It is a choice that so many women in my electorate have to make every day, and it is not fair that families have to see this. We are also investing in the safety and security of our regions. We will be seeing $300,000 worth of CCTV coming into my electorate of Lindsay—$200,000 into the main streets of Penrith on High Street and Station Street and another $100,000 into Queen Street, St Marys—once again making our shopping districts safe and making it good for families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what this budget is about: building the regions for the future of Australia. It is about building where the next sheep's back is going to be, where the next mining boom is going to be, where the next manufacturing industry is going to be. And do you know what? It is going to be in Western Sydney. I can say that categorically, with my own bias of Western Sydney. I am so proud of this budget. I am so proud that we finally have a Prime Minister and a Treasurer that believe in the value of Western Sydney. They are not just there milking it. They are not putting out a Lindsay test. They are not just saying, 'Oh, Lindsay! Let's test Lindsay.' They are actually putting their money where their mouth is. That is why this budget is good. This is a budget that is getting the budget under control but investing in our country and the economic sustainability for the future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M2Y" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TUDGE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  I rise to speak on these appropriation bills. There are three things I would like to outline in the time I have available. Firstly, I would like to outline the rationale for the budget and what we are hoping to achieve through the decisions that the government has made. Secondly, I would like to address some particular concerns raised in the community. Thirdly, I would like to outline some of the initiatives that specifically impact on my electorate of Aston. Let me start with the budget rationale.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This, as everybody knows, is a tough budget. We acknowledge that. We have had to reduce some expenditure. We have had to initiate a debt levy on high-income earners. We realise that some of these measures are not popular, but the government has done these things for a reason. The reason is that the public finances are in an absolute mess due to the decisions of the former government. We are simply spending beyond our means and this is simply not sustainable. This budget is about restoring our finances because we cannot have a strong, prosperous economy without a strong budget. Let me outline the figures to illustrate how unsustainable the financial position was before this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, having gone from a $20 billion surplus in 2007, Labor ran up the six biggest budget deficits in Australian political history, totalling $191 billion. Secondly, their forecasts were for a further $123 billion in deficits over the next four years. This meant that the aggregate debt was to grow to $667 billion. That means about $25,000 for every single man, woman and child in this country. The interest alone on our present debt today is about $1 billion a month. That $1 billion represents the cost of a public hospital. So without this interest bill we could build 12 public hospitals this year, but we cannot because we are spending $1 billion per month. We are simply spending way more than we are earning and, as every householder knows, you just cannot do that indefinitely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition did not create this fiscal mess but we accept the responsibility to fix it. This budget brings the finances back under control. It eliminates almost $300 billion worth of debt. It reduces the deficit by $44 billion over the next four years, which is the budget period. It shows a pathway back to surplus, having reduced the deficit in 2017, the final year of the budget estimates, from $18 billion to $3 billion. There are tough decisions to get to this position. I acknowledge that and I wish we did not have to make those tough decisions, but we would be abrogating our responsibility as a national government if we did not take action now. We were elected to fix up the financial mess left by the former Labor government and we are doing exactly that through this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to address some concerns raised in the community. The first one is the allegation that we have made substantial cuts to hospitals and to schools. I would like to clarify that by pointing out exactly what we are doing over the four-year budget period. Firstly, far from making cuts to hospitals, we are increasing hospital expenditure to record levels. Next year we will increase hospital expenditure by nine per cent, the year after by a further nine per cent, the year after that by a further nine per cent and in the final year of the budget four-year period by six per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at schools. Again we are increasing school funding to record levels. Next year we will increase school funding by eight per cent, the following year by a further eight per cent, the year after that by a further eight per cent and the year after that by a further six per cent. These are very substantial increases in funding to hospitals and schools, and it is simply wrong for Labor to allege that we have cut funding to hospitals and schools and placing fear in the community and leading people to believe that hospital beds will be closed or there will be fewer teachers next year as a result of this budget. It is simply incorrect; we are increasing funding to hospitals and schools to record levels. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is similar in relation to pensions. Let me be very clear: there are no cuts to pensions in this budget. The pension will continue to increase every six months. It increased in March, it will increase further in September. It will increase again the following March and the following September and so on. Every single pension supplement will continue as it has done previously to this point in time. The only two decisions that have been made in relation to the pension are, firstly, to increase the eligibility for the pension to 70 years of age by 2035. In that period of time, nearly every single person who is 70 by 2035 will have been earning superannuation for most of their careers; presently superannuation is accessible at the age of 60. Secondly, the other decision we have made is to ensure that pensions are indexed according to the CPI from 2017. This means that the pension will continue to increase in real terms from 2017 according to the CPI. So we have not cut pensions, as the Labor Party would make you believe. In fact, they will increase every six months, as they have always done; we have just made those two changes that I have mentioned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to universities, there are some very substantial reforms in this budget. We have deregulated the university system to enable our universities to flourish, to enable them to be world class. This will mean in some cases that some university fees will go up, but in other cases university fees will stay as they are. In further cases they may in fact come down. Importantly though, there will be no upfront fees. Even if fees do go up somewhat, they will still be part of the overall HECS, which means there are no upfront payments and every payment is only made once the person has graduated and is earning more than $50,000 in salary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, there are some very substantial measures that will particularly benefit low-SES students. In particular, for the first time HECS will be available for subdegrees—for associate degrees and for diplomas. HECS will also, for the first time, be available for private higher education providers. The combination of those two measures means there will be an additional 80,000 university opportunities for students across this nation, and predominantly those opportunities will be taken up by families who typically may not have had a university graduate before because sometimes a diploma is a pathway through to going on to a higher degree.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to touch on the Medicare co-payments. The government is asking Australians to pay $7 when they go to a doctor in order to try to make Medicare sustainable. Expenditure on Medicare is growing exponentially, a growth which is simply not sustainable. The Medicare levy covers less than 20 per cent of health costs so that is not necessarily a mechanism to ensure the sustainability of Medicare over all.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $7 co-payment is similar to the co-payment that Labor introduced for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Labor introduced that co-payment for precisely the reasons that this government is advocating the co-payment for Medicare—that is, to make the system sustainable over the longer term. We want to see it sustainable. We want to see Medicare be a central part of our system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, with these co-payment measures there is a safety net which covers about 40 per cent of all Australians. Everybody with a concession card and all children under the age of 16 would only have to pay a maximum of $70 in any one calendar year. Further, a doctor will still have discretion, if a particular individual has financial hardship, to waive that $7 fee. The overall aim is to ensure that there is a proper safety net but that the Medicare system as we know it today is sustainable well into the future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will conclude by mentioning some of the measures in the budget which are specifically targeted at my electorate. Firstly, there are some community safety measures which I have announced locally already. These were election commitments which I made, and I am very pleased to see that they are being delivered in my electorate over the course of the 2014-15 financial year. It includes security cameras for three shopping strips, better lighting at Scoresby Village and Alchester Village and some mobile security cameras for Knox police. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also some infrastructure funding to support the upgrade of some of the local community sports facilities. That is important because we want to have as many young people participating in sport or other community activities as possible. If young people are participating in these activities it keeps them busy and it keeps them off the street. Importantly, the large sporting clubs are also places where young people can get mentored by older people. So I think these funds for sporting infrastructure provide a benefit, not just to the people directly using that community infrastructure but to the entire community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there was additional funding for the East West Link—a further $1.5 billion, bringing the total federal contribution to $3 billion for the East West Link. That will have enormous benefit for residents of my electorate in Aston to ensure that they can get into the city and across the city more quickly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of other measures that I will continue to fight for, including important roads such as the extension of Police Road to take the pressure off Bergins Road. I am going to continue to fight for improvements to Napoleon Road. I will continue to fight to improve the Boronia Heights Primary School, which is in need of an upgrade. I will continue to support and fight for the upgrade to the Bayswater CFA. Of course, I will never stop fighting for the Rowville rail, which is long overdue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me conclude by saying that, yes, this was a tough budget. I acknowledge that. In an ideal world we would not have to deliver a tough budget. We would not have to make expenditure cuts and we would not have to put in place measures such as the debt levy on high-income earners. But the simple fact is that the budget position was unsustainable. Our nation was expending far more than we were raising in revenues, and that position was unsustainable. You simply cannot continue to spend more than you raise; otherwise you get into a situation like Greece, Spain or Italy. We certainly do not want to go down that path.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is a tough budget but it is ultimately necessary for the public finances to be restored to a healthy position. And, overall, it is good for the nation.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GRIFFIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:24</span>):  Many speakers have gone through the aspects of the appropriation bills that have been debated most publicly and I do not intend to focus on them. I particularly want to focus on some issues that relate to the veterans community and particularly to indexation changes that the government has announced will take effect in 2017, after the next election. There is nothing more ex than an ex-minister, although I say that with respect to my colleague the member for Fisher, who I think knows exactly what I mean. In the three years since I left the veterans affairs portfolio I have tended to maintain an interest in issues in that area, but I have also tended to stay out of the public debate—I think that is the best thing to do when you are in my situation. Having said that, time has passed and, when I look at some of the debates in the veterans community in the time I was shadow minister and also minister, there have certainly been some developments in this budget which deserve public comment and some public explanation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although this argument goes right across the board in terms of income support payments through the social security system, I will speak particularly in relation to the veterans community. The indexation of benefits in the veterans area has been a vexed issue for many years. It has been a vexed issue because many veterans, given their age and often give the impacts of their service, have become reliant on government support—whether that has been through the service pension, which is basically the same as the age pension, or the disability support pension, which can be accessed at an earlier age by veterans in recognition of the impacts of their service, or income support payments, whether they be compensation payments for disability, which are the various rates of pension provided for those with proven impacts from their service- or war-caused disabilities right up to and including the totally and permanently incapacitated pension, or the special rate pension. Then there have also been the arguments around military superannuation and the indexation methodology employed with respect to some parts of those schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This debate has gone on almost since 1997 when the Howard government, to its credit, put in place the indexation system that linked the growth in pensions to both CPI and male total average weekly earnings, or MTAWE. However, there were some benefit payments within the veterans community that were not covered by that—particularly, disability pensions. There was a debate within the veterans community over a number of years about that. There were adjustments made in 2004 to elements of that as a result of the Clark Review of Veterans' Entitlements, and then there was a debate in the lead-up to the 2007 election on the need for the special rate pension to be indexed. The opposition—at that time I was the shadow minister—came forth with a policy in 2007 that said we would do exactly that, in recognition of the fact that TPIs in particular relied on that money to maintain a reasonable standard of living, and in those circumstances there was an erosion in relative value of their payments occurring over time as result of the difference between CPI indexation and MTAWE. The argument was all about fairness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the shadows of the 2007 election the then minister, Minister Billson, put forward legislation to make these changes and, to his credit, he extended them further. I congratulated him at the time. That happened in around September 2007 and it came into effect just after the election of the Rudd government. Labor then initiated the Harmer review of income support payments. That led to a significant initial one-off increase in income support payments, which was expressed as a percentage of male total average weekly earnings. This led to an argument from quite a few people in the veterans community that there should have been further adjustments to the special rate pension and disability pensions to take that issue into account. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also, if you like, gave added impetus to the argument by some military superannuants about the indexation for their superannuation pensions particularly those who are on DFRB or DFRDB, which are two of the schemes. The circumstances then on an ongoing basis over the last several years has been an argument around those particular issues: the issue of the Harmer review and the attempts being made by those in the veteran community to seek a catch-up payment to the special rate pension in particular, and the argument around the question of what was described as 'fair indexation' with respect to military superannuation pensions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current government when in opposition made commitments around the question of DFRB and DFRDB indexation methodologies. It was described by the then shadow minister, and now the minister, as being all about 'fair indexation'—and these were words which were used by members of the now government, by the now Prime Minister in the lead-up to the last election and since. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to quote from a publication from the Vietnam Veterans' Federation of Australia, a description of arguments around this bill by the then opposition and the private member's bill which was put forward by the then opposition in the lead-up to the last election. It said:</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The irony of this with respect to the actual payments we are talking about here is that, for example, in the veterans area there are basically three elements of payments in broad terms that people can qualify for. There are income support payments which are part of the safety net provided, which in this case is the service pension and the invalidity service pension, and the war widow's pension, effectively—although there is an element of compensation associated with that. There are disability pensions which relate to the impact of war caused injuries, the special rate and the disability rate pensions. Then there is superannuation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some veterans would qualify for all three. They would qualify on the basis of injury or wounds for an element of disability pension, if you like, compensation for the effect of service. They would qualify for some element of military superannuation given the nature of the length of time that they were in the service, although, overwhelmingly, those who served at that time did not qualify for military superannuation because of the length of time served. And if their superannuation payment was not large enough—and for most that would be the case because the average payment per annum in these circumstances would be somewhere around $22,000 or $23,000—they would also potentially qualify for a part pension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bizarre thing in the circumstances of an individual in that situation now is that the base payment, which is the income support payment, will be indexed at a less fair rate, according to the arguments put by the then shadow minister, Senator Ronaldson, and by many others in the coalition and certainly by me in the context of the discussion around the issue of indexation with the TPI pension back in 2007 and since. It will be less advantageous in respect of the base income support payment. It will be less advantageous for the compensation payment that they receive in recognition of the injuries they have received as a result of their service. But it will be more advantageously and more fairly indexed for the top-up military superannuation payment, which they have every right to receive and have earnt—no question—but which is an additional payment beyond the base payment and the compensation payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, a TPI who is on the full special rate and who was a military superannuant who will receive this increase is in fact now going to go backwards once those two changes are implemented, because whatever increase occurs that is additional with respect to the movements of MTAWE in respect of military superannuation will in fact be dropped off the special rate payment. And, given the special rate payment is in excess of $32,000—as against a pension of some $22,000 or $23,000-plus on average—because the base rates are bigger what you will see is that the impact of that change will be greater; plus the increase they receive on military supperannuation will be used for consideration with respect to qualifications for income support and for taxation purposes. For most TPIs who are in receipt of a service pension at the full rate it will just be bad news.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has tried to make it clear in the House that, although we have argued that this is a cut, there will be no cut and the pensions will go up every six months. That is correct, if CPI goes up—and it almost invariably does; although in the last 10-plus years it has tended to go up by a lot less than MTAWE. But he is right: pensions will go up, but they will not go up by anywhere near what they would have gone up by if we see a situation over the years ahead where male total average weekly earnings moves at a different rate, as it has in past times. There have been a number of calculations around this. A lot depends on the actual movements. For example, on Channel 7 Mark Riley estimated that with the service pension, if movements are in line with cost of living rather than current indexation in the years ahead, you will see a difference by 2020 of some $100 a fortnight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ADSO, the Alliance of Defence Service Organisations and partners, calculated that over the four years to March 2014 the service pension catch-up has been linked to increases in the average wages, resulting in pension payments over that period totalling $2,000 more than they would have been if they had been linked only to increases in the cost of living. The question of what happens will depend on those movements. But, frankly, the circumstances are that MTAWE has been in excess of CPI for, I think, all bar the last movement in almost all of the last 10-plus years. That is going to lead to a situation where veterans are worse off. We are going to see a situation where the cuts are in effect. There will be an erosion in the value of those payments, an erosion from what they would have been, and it is going to hurt. It is going to hit people who have given much for their country. It is going to hit people who are in a situation where they are relying on these payments to have a decent future. In those circumstances, these are concerns which the government needs to address. The Prime Minister says that pensions will be going up. Yes, they will, but they will not be going up by anything like what they would have been, and the effect will be a cut in the value of the payments, a cut in the living standards of the pensioners right across the board. These measures are insidious. It is a mean act. It needs to be opposed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="2K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROUGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  This budget sets out some of the problems and some of the solutions to Australia's long-term concerns and how we as a nation should seek to address them. I take you back to the Howard era, when Treasurer Costello introduced the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational report</span>. This brought to the consciousness of the Australian population the major challenges facing the country as we age and live longer—and that is a good thing. I am all for living longer, as I am sure everybody in this House is, but it does bring with it some real challenges. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, there are approximately 175,000 new entrants into the workforce. That will be made up of a combination of school leavers, university leavers and people coming to Australia as immigrants. But in the not-too-distant future—in fact, in the 2020s; this position will probably peak in 2017, maybe a little earlier—we will start to see a decline in the number of people coming into the workforce, to the point where it drops off to being approximately 10 per cent of the 175,000. 'So what?' you ask. The point is that, with fewer workers coming in and a large number going out the other end and becoming retirees, we end up with fewer workers paying PAYG tax and adding to the social fabric of Australia from a productivity perspective and also a taxation perspective, and more people in the retirement phase, obviously putting huge pressure on all elements of society. So that is, on one side of the equation, a problem; it is a challenge—how we address that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is another, conflicting issue that comes into this, and that is the impact that we are seeing today—and it will continue to grow—of technology, data, the internet and all things associated with IT. Every person in this House, certainly every member of the parliament and the Senate, and almost every other person will have more computing power in the palm of their hand than sent man to the moon. Let us just reflect on that for a moment. This is in the space of our lifetime. I remember sitting watching man land on the moon in 1969 on the one black-and-white television at my primary school, with the dark velvet curtains pulled back, with some of the adults, and we marvelled at the power that made that possible. But that is less than the power that we all have today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what does this mean? It means that the disruption that is going to occur to our way of life, to society and to the jobs that flow from technology is something that every person in Australia, every business, every board and every politician needs to take into account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is some stark reality from the US. Research has been done as to the lengths of recessions—that is, the period of time from when peak employment drops off until it comes back up to that level. From 1948 to 1980, the average time after recessions that it took for employment to get back to the level it was at before was roughly two years—24 months—or a little under.But then it started to deteriorate. After 1981, it took 28 months for the US to come back to the same levels of employment. By 1990, it was 32 months. By the 2001 recession, it had blown out to 47 months—four years. But, since the 2007 recession, the US has still not returned to the same level of employment, some 70-plus months later. In other words, the time it takes for the economy to create enough employment to fill the gaps from the jobs lost is getting longer and longer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason for that is right before our eyes. As anyone who has walked into an airport of late has realised, you no longer line up to check in with a human being; you do it yourself. Sure, there are still two or three staff there in the terminal, but there are not the banks of human labour lining up to assist us. When you check out at Coles or Woolworths today you have the option of interfacing with another human being to pay or doing it yourself with a computer. We take all of these things in our stride as they are happening, but bit by bit they are eroding jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we are seeing the demise of the car industry in Australia, and there are a number of reasons for that—the cost of doing business here, the fact that Australians are not buying Australian cars—but a large component of that is that the automation in the world of automobile manufacturing is extraordinary. We now have cars on the road in San Francisco owned by Google that are driverless. Six years ago they said it was impossible. Why do I raise this? There is a very short time lag between the introduction of experimental machinery and it becoming commercialised. What are the implications of having driverless vehicles? Do we need cab drivers? Do we need delivery drivers? In my son's own industry, mining, Rio Tinto is moving more and more to driverless trucks. This is human beings being put out of business in a way we have never seen before. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, we have a conflict. Australia has an ageing population and a shrinking number of people coming into the labour market. On the other side of the equation, technology and the internet are driving change which is shrinking the labour market. Research tells us that 47 per cent of all of the job categories in the world today are under threat as a direct result of these technologies. A lot of tertiary qualified people listening to this today will be sitting there thinking, 'I'm okay.' No, you are not. The reality is that if you are a lawyer or an accountant—or even if you are in the medical professions or you are a pharmacist—your job is under threat. We in government need to start taking this seriously, because these are the issues that are going to confront us in the next 5,10 and 15 years. We need to be careful that we do not leave people behind and create social dysfunction. Look to Europe today and see how many tertiary qualified white-collar workers are out of work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue that we need to take into account is the shifting of taxation. We have had a bit of a debate in this country about GST on imports of under a thousand dollars. I was the minister who worked on those figures back in the Howard days. Let us have a look at what is happening. There is a company called Oasis run by two women out of the UK. They have no presence in Australia. They are a fashion label. There are no stores in the High Street, but they do sell two jumbo jet loads of women's clothes into Australia every week. They do not pay any tax here; they do not employ anyone here. This is the way of the world. I am not railing against it. I am not a Luddite who says we should stop these things. I am saying that we need to be aware of them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you look at the Microsofts and the Googles—they have international platforms. Where do they pay their tax? People pay their tax wherever they can pay the least. I do not begrudge them that, but the reality is that, as the tax base is eroded as a result of people being able to make these choices—since they no longer need a physical presence in any particular jurisdiction—it means that the problems of governments worldwide are going to grow deeper. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ageing population; fewer people coming into the workforce; computerisation and automation leading to more job losses, meaning fewer PAYG taxpayers; and those whose platforms give them the capacity to influence the direction of the world and who can also influence the world through the amount of tax they pay and where they pay it—these are issues that we in Australia need to address now. It starts with kindergarten. It starts with the fact that we do not have enough students in this country learning science and mathematics and preparing to be part of the world as it is going to be. Sure, we all sit there on our smartphones, as the member opposite is doing right now. What he has at his fingertips at this moment is access to the world—and so do children, and they do this every single day. But what we need them to do is to be more than just consumers; we need them to be part of the innovation that is required. As part of that solution, I am suggesting that Australia now needs to look at how we use the incredible wealth within our superannuation system—not to underwrite it, but to leverage that money innovatively so that Australia can get to the forefront and hold our place in the world and not just be consumers of these technologies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are big problems. I will inform the House, for those who do not know, of some of the other massive challenges just around the corner. Many of you will have heard of 3-D printers, but some will not have. A 3-D printer today can print human organs for use in the body. How much longer will it be before 3-D printers will be in businesses in your suburb and then in your house? Instead of going to the hardware store to get a bit of pipe to repair—where you need a supply chain, logistics and transportation—what you do is download a 3-D blueprint off the internet for 20c, you put it into your 3-D printer and you print it out. This is not science fiction; this is science fact that is here today. If we as legislators, as governments, as oppositions, as leaders in our communities are not aware of what is coming then we are going to condemn the next generation to be preparing for jobs which do not exist. It is going to affect the education sector, it will affect the hospitality sector and the mining sector. In fact, every single section of our society will be impacted and sooner than we think.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the area of IT it has been said that people overestimate the impact of IT in the short term and underestimate it in the long term. The problem is that the long term is becoming shorter and shorter. Today the information we hold an our hand is superseded every six months. The amount of technology and the amount of change that we all see and we can reflect on in the last 40 years will be quadrupled in the next 10 years. All of these things are real issues that need to be exercising the minds of our nation's leaders and our boards of directors today. No longer can we rely upon our geographical isolation. No longer can we use glib phrases such as 'the Asian century'. Our locality and our close proximity will not necessarily be what saves us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I was talking to a company that set up here in Australia and they were looking at where they would have their distribution centre to distribute the product in Australia—whether it be in Sydney or Melbourne. When they did their analysis they found it was actually cheaper to remain with the distribution centre in Texas USA and bring the product to Australia from there. What does this say about some of the structural issues that face us? They are enormous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a departmental staffer in the House who I ran into recently. Her son has big feet and he had to play basketball. So he went down to the local store to get himself a pair of basketball shoes and he couldn't find any. In desperation he got on the internet. He found what he was looking for from the US on Friday night. His shoes were delivered to his door on Monday morning. Monday morning! If you had managed to find a shop to order them, they would have taken three or four weeks. He managed to get them at about half the price and within three days. People say it is like the Industrial Revolution again. No, it is not. The reality is that if someone comes up with a new invention today in any part of the world it can be in the rest of the world the next day. So the impacts that we are finding are fast and they are furious.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me take you to an icon of Australia—Australia Post. Right now it is struggling. Its mail peaked in 2008 and since then it is sending a billion items of surface mail fewer a year. Why? Because of the impact of the internet. So this part of the fabric of Australian society which has underpinned so many communities is now under threat as a direct result of these changes to the way in which we do business and because of technology. There is no point sticking our heads in the sand and saying: 'That's no good. We need to prop them up.' That is what fools do. We need to embrace the change and we need to see what we can use those existing structures and that existing human capital for. And when we do and when we find new methods and new ways of using that base, it will be government services. Those government services today are delivered by other agencies. So no matter which way you cut it, slice it or dice it, there will be further reductions in the need for human capital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today as we reflect on the 2014 budget and some of the issues that are confronting us as a nation regarding an ageing population and the fact that health care is doubling every 10 years, and that someone has to pay it, we need to turn our minds to how we prepare for the changes that no government can stop. No government is going to stop the march of technology, the interference of the internet and of robotics. It is coming to a town and a society and a job near you. What we need to do is open our eyes to both the opportunities and the challenges, and across the divide of this parliament recognise that there are things bigger than our political ideologies which are going to drive the future of our nation and our world. We can decide to be part of it and embrace it or we can ignore it at our peril. I plead with this parliament, as parliamentarians, to educate yourselves to these changes and to be part of finding the solutions for the next generation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Are these the words of a modern-day prophet? Speaking to the Institute of Economic Affairs in London in April 2012, Joe Hockey, now the Treasurer, was laying it on a plate. That was two years ago. Now all we hear from Labor and the crossbenchers is that they have had no warnings: it is all about broken promises and no time to prepare. What a load of rot. There it was laid out on a platter 24 months ago. That is when we started explaining it to Australia. On May 13 this year, we carved it up into bite-sized chunks, and we are still hearing that it is too tough to swallow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today to support this series of appropriation bills because they will start us on the path to saving a great economy. We laid out the problem well in advance of action. We have cut it up into bite-sized pieces for easier consumption. We understand there is a period of rumination, even of spitting some bits out. But, at the end of the day, it is crucial these bills make it through. I do not often play travel agent or tour guide, but if we do not get this budget passed, in complete or near-complete form, we are all going to Europe together—and not for a holiday.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look a bit closer at the ruin that is rife in the European Union, Japan and the US. It always starts with private debt, particularly household debt, which then becomes public and government debt when the economy hits the ropes. There is a lot of talk about what is really going on with Australia's finances at the moment, so I want to lay the facts on the table in a pretty impartial way. It is true that we do not have the highest level of government debt in the Western world yet; in fact, we are still some way away from it. But we do have the one of the highest levels of household debt in the Western world through mortgages and credit cards. Private household debt in Australia—excuse the pun—is through the roof. Few other countries, except for Ireland, come close. This is why you hear that so many people my age, living in my electorate of Hume, are scared about their mortgages. They are worried about losing their jobs, about interest rates going up and about the cost of living going up. I hear this every day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now layering mountains of government debt on top of our private debt. We have $1.84 trillion of household debt. These are such big numbers they are almost meaningless. That is bigger than the whole economy itself. It is equal to $80,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. The interest bill is over $100 billion per year. But if we do not intervene now, within four years our public debt, on top of this private household debt, will reach $667 billion—around $50,000 per household. It is a mountain of red ink that is getting higher and higher. It is growing very, very fast. In fact, we know that Australia's public debt is rising the fastest of any country in the OECD. For us to stand by and not act on it would be incredibly irresponsible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To see how this might play out in practice, let's look at some other countries. There is no shortage of sobering examples. During the eighties and nineties, Japan had private debt levels equal to the size of their economy—a little less than we have in Australia today. This fuelled a property boom, which many of us remember, and it was not a problem so long as property prices stayed high. But in the early to mid-nineties, the Japanese property sector collapsed and the private debt—the household debt—was transferred over to the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us put this in perspective. Before the property price collapse in Japan, government debt was equal to less than half of the economy. But, as the economy hit the ropes, the government had to step in to prevent systemic failure, and government debt increased threefold relative to the size of the economy. The following two decades have created immeasurable pain for the Japanese economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see similar patterns in the United States. By 2007 US household debt had reached about 130 per cent of disposable income. Meanwhile, savings rates had collapsed. When the financial crisis hit, federal government debt was around 45 per cent of GDP, but, again, the government had to step in to take on that household debt, and government debt moved rapidly north, towards 100 per cent of the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can debate whether these countries got the policy settings right on their day of reckoning. But what is clear is that high private debt, high household debt, is easily and often transferred over to the government. The best antidote is to run government surpluses when we can and to support strong economic growth, investment and employment. That will ensure that my constituents with mortgages and with large credit card debts are in the best possible position to survive tough times. Having high government debts and deficits when there is a towering household debt is like taking the shock absorbers out of your car. When you hit a bump in the road you need shock absorbers; and when the government already has too much debt there is absolutely nowhere to go. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">None of this is to say that I am pessimistic about the economy. In fact, given the emphasis in the budget on investment in productive infrastructure, workforce participation, research and education, there is good reason to be optimistic. Indeed, driving growth through participation, investment in infrastructure and so on is exactly the response to the situation. In this circumstance strong growth in employment is critical and it is what we are focused on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Australian with a mortgage knows the danger of losing your job. That is why this budget is enabling long-term growth rates in employment, with a shift from consumption to investment. In contrast, continuing to run up government debt in the face of this towering mountain would be totally irresponsible. Everyone in my electorate with a loan should be screaming at Labor and the crossbenchers to play their part in sorting this out. We cannot take the risk of continuing down this path. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a another side to this. For decades, resource economists have studied the economic implications of a big surge in commodity investments and exports, exactly as we are experiencing today and have been experiencing for a number of years. Ironically, much of the best economic research has been done here in Australia, but the last government ignored it. The conclusions of this research are very clear and totally aligned with this budget. First, it is absolutely critical to drive productivity with investments in participation in the workforce, infrastructure and innovation. This takes pressure off the non-resource parts of the economy. In the absence of these initiatives, we see the scorching of non-resource parts of the economy, often referred to as a Dutch disease. We saw no shortage of Dutch disease in the economy over the last six years, as our tradeable sectors like agriculture, education, tourism and even resources itself struggled with a huge loss of competitiveness driven by an unduly high exchange rate. In my electorate of Hume, we saw a range of businesses—farmers, engineers and others—suffering from this disastrous situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as driving productivity, governments need to run surpluses, and, wherever possible, push those savings offshore into their own sovereign wealth funds. Of course, when you have hundreds of billions of dollars of debt and deficits of $50 billion a year, government saving is only a dream. But reducing our deficit is what we need to do, and it is exactly what we are doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us put this reduction in the deficit that we are now undertaking into perspective. Roughly $10 billion a year in deficit reduction is planned through the budget forward estimates period and the year beyond. That equates to about 0.6 per cent of GDP. Most economists will tell you that the private sector will absorb a good portion of that loss. So the reduction in economic activity that we are talking about here is pretty minimal and pretty manageable, given the starting point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news with all of this is that—people often forget—when you cut government spending, a series of benefits flow. Most importantly, cutting deficits helps to contain interest rates. Interest rates worldwide are very low, and Australia's are far higher than everyone else's by two or three percentage points. But by containing interest rates, we take pressure off those with mortgages—the ones raising kids, buying houses and so on. The low global interest rates will not stay with us forever. As they climb, the risk is that ours will climb with them. The stakes are very high, but reduced deficits give the Reserve Bank the opportunity to contain interest rates. Everyone with a mortgage should be thankful that this government is working to live within its means. On top of taking pressure off interest rates, running government surpluses—or reducing the deficit—also takes pressure off the exchange rate, helping our farmers and other exporters. We absolutely have to do this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final reason why we have to act on the deficit is because we cannot leave huge debts for the next generation. There is one fundamental difference between government debt and private debt—and that is, you cannot leave private debt to your kids, but you can leave government debt to your kids. That creates an enormous temptation for bad governments. That is what has happened in Europe, that is what is happening in the US and, in the absence of our intervention, that is exactly what will happen here in Australia. The need to act is very clear now, and the benefits from immediate action are enormous—for mortgage holders, for exporters, and for the next generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, you remember the excitement—the travel brochures out on the coffee table, the suitcase flung open. Going to Europe was something to look forward to. We do not want to go to Europe now—in Greece, Portugal and Spain the debts are, arguably, unpayable. In Spain, the 18- to 35-year-olds are facing a 40 per cent unemployment rate or more. The debts owing in Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Belgium, Spain and Italy have seen the near collapse of the eurozone—and it all started with too much private debt. Australia has a huge private debt. We do not want to go to Europe. The appropriation bills before the House are the start of a different kind of journey for Australia: a journey of recovery. This is the trip we really want to be taking. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M3M" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  I rise to speak on this appropriation bill and the related bills before the House. One thing that dismays me about the operation of this parliament is the propensity of those opposite to willingly and knowingly make mischief with the facts, when faced with the serious task of fixing our nation's economy. Our opponents have spent the past three weeks promoting misinformation and building contrary views to undermine what desperately needs to be done to get the budget back on track and to fix the debt and deficit disaster that they left behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is tasked with confronting the facts of our national debt and our budgetary situation. If no action is taken, Australian taxpayers are facing a gross debt projected to blow out to $667 billion within the next decade. We are currently burdened by $1 billion per month in interest on this debt—that is, one thousand million dollars every month—just to service the interest on our debt. The Treasurer has stated that 70 per cent of this money goes to people overseas. As a taxpayer, as a father, as a former business owner, as a mortgage holder and as a representative for the people of Bennelong, I cannot sit idly by and support this disastrous situation. What makes matters worse is that, should we not act—which is what those opposite want—our interest repayments could balloon to $3 billion each and every month. It would represent an absolute mockery of our responsibility to the Australian people if we, the elected government, did not take decisive action. We would be negligent in our duties if we left this kind of debt and deficit mess behind for our children's generation to clean up. And yet, incredibly, those opposite seem unconvinced of the need for action. Instead, they sit on their hands and accuse us of overdramatising our nation's economic situation. So I put it to the opposition: at what point should we start to get nervous?—when the monthly interest on our debt is $2 billion? Or $4 billion? For how long can we afford to be complacent?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What became abundantly clear to Australian taxpayers over the past six years is that the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments set this country on an unsustainable path, which continues to threaten our future prosperity. Yet again, just as in 1996, we, the coalition, have been elected to fix the economy and clean up Labor's mess. It is a cornerstone of adult economic management that we must live within our means. This budget is a mature response to Australia's economic outlook. It proposes reasonable savings and asks all Australians to make a small contribution towards our future prosperity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To those opposite who seek to distract the Australian people from the real issues facing the nation, I refer them to the words of ABC journalist Jonathon Green, on 22 May:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It might suit the sugary, elevated pulse of social media to deduce political and budgetary incompetence from the momentary dipping of an eyelid, but on quiet, sober reflection it hardly seems a compelling argument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A relationship of trust between government and the Australian people is central to good governance. Six years of Labor's mismanagement has strained this relationship, but we are committed to it. Yet, as in any relationship, the government's trusted bond with the Australian people is vulnerable to gossip and untruths. So allow me to present the facts, the truth. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government created economic peril during their six years in office, smearing dirt on Australia's international image and tarnishing our reputation aboard. Their actions in government communicated a clear message to our trading partners and investors: that for the first time in our history Australia was considered a nation of sovereign risk. Labor sought to savage the economic potential of the mining boom by introducing a tax that threatened to curtail investment. They compromised relations with valued trading partners over restrictions to live exports, which hurt farmers at home and offended our Indonesian neighbours. Their failure to honour the recommendations of the independent PBAC for listings of new medicines sent shockwaves overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike our predecessors, the Abbott government seeks to rebuild trust, at home and abroad. We have made it very clear since coming to office that Australia is once again open for business. But to remain a country worth investing in, we must make changes. We cannot live off the credit card and pay interest on further borrowings. It is time for us to live within our means so that our children can enjoy the prosperity that is earned, not a lifestyle that is paid for on the credit card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the lead-up to last year's election, this government made four great promises: stop the boats, pay back the debt, scrap the carbon tax and build the roads of the 21st century. In the cut and thrust of daily conversation and endless questioning, it is easy to lose sight of these core promises. Those opposite have fuelled speculation that we have somehow been untrue to our word in areas like education, health and pensions. Yet the level of misinformation being circulated is astounding and, honestly, the Australian people deserve better; they deserve honesty. They deserve to know that the coalition government is taking funding for schools to record highs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing more than the previous government would have spent over the forward estimates to ensure schools in all states and territories receive extra funding. In the tertiary education sector we will release the potential of universities across the country and create a dynamic industry. We are asking students to contribute 50-50 towards the cost of their degrees, recognising that the median student will earn substantially more than their contemporaries without  degrees. We are asking students to pay their fair share, only half.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To cry foul on this is a blatant misrepresentation of the facts. What could be more fair than the government offering all students a loan to cover their higher-education costs, and then asking the student to pay back just half of that loan if and when they start earning a decent salary and therefore have the capacity to do so? The other half will be paid by the taxpayer. This is truly a universal system, enabling people from all backgrounds to access a higher education and the potential financial rewards that result. Also in the interests of access and equity, we are extending Commonwealth support to an additional 80,000 students enrolled in any registered higher education institution including, for the first time, TAFEs all around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people also deserve to know the truth about health. In this budget, annual hospital funding increases over the next four years. Labor made radical promises to skyrocket health funding outside the forward estimates. The fact is that this promise was never sensible nor affordable; it was a fantasy concocted by an irresponsible government that never expected to deliver it. They also promised to build the Epping to Parramatta rail link in my electorate, and that did not happen either. In contrast, this government is in the business of making sensible, sustainable commitments to the Australian people, like our commitment to raise $20 billion for a medical research endowment, which will provide incentive for pioneering developments in scientific discovery and generate further investment. The introduction of a $7 Medicare co-payment is a fair and equitable measure, designed to ensure the sustainability of our healthcare system, while guaranteeing that detailed protections remain in place to support the chronically ill and those most vulnerable members of our community. The system also gives the doctor the discretion not to charge the co-payment if they choose to do so. Just as some doctors now bulk-bill, whilst many others charge around $80 for a consultation, so will the market ensure a strong level of access for all under the new system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the Australian people deserve to know the truth about pensions. Under this government, the pension will continue to increase twice each year to keep up with the cost of living. Recognising this commitment, it is also crucial to recognise that Australians are living longer and healthier lives. We must turn our attention to the challenges this will impose on our economy in the years and decades ahead. To cope with the prospect of an ageing population, reforms were announced in this budget to ensure the age pension system is sustainable and able to meet future demand, continuing to provide for those in need. Without policy reform, the cost of the age pension is projected to increase by 70 per cent over the next decade, up to $68 billion a year. Like other governments around the world and the previous Labor government, we will also raise the pension age so that we can sustain the increased demand for pension support for the years to come. When the pension was brought in the average male life expectancy was 63. Now it is over 80. The system must evolve and keep pace with society. Like all Australians, aged pensioners will be better off under the Abbott coalition government after the carbon tax is scrapped because they will keep their energy supplement and save considerably on their costs of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have received a variety of correspondence from Bennelong constituents since the release of the budget. Much of this I have responded to personally through direct phone calls, and, with very few exceptions, people have been very reasonable and understanding of the need for the government to take bold steps to get our budget back on track. While some sections of society have been whipped into a frenzy by those opposite based on blatant misinformation, the vast majority of constituents I have spoken to recognise that we have become complacent and overly dependent in an age of entitlement. It is simply unsustainable to have a situation where the majority of Australians receive some kind of welfare payment. I fully support the notion and understand the need for a social safety net. During my previous career I saw many instances overseas of widespread abject poverty that our nation's safety net protects us from. However, it is necessary for us to ensure that people who have the potential to become productive members of society do not become dependent on welfare, spiralling into the possibility of cross-generational dependency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our well-intentioned safety net has increasingly become a cargo net. Australian taxpayers should not be investing in a system that carries those who have the capacity to contribute. It is time for all Australians to reflect on our privileged status as the lucky country and to ask a very important question: how can we sustain the lifestyle we are so accustomed to for generations to come? We owe it to our children, and future proud Australians, to share the heavy lifting. Weaning ourselves off dependency is a difficult but necessary process. This government is up to the task and accepts the need for sensible, sustainable economic growth. We ask the Australian people to join us in our commitment to ensure the future prosperity of this great country is prosperity earned. We ask those opposite to do what they know is right for the long-term strength of this nation, not for short-term political point scoring. This budget reinstates Australia's values of the opportunity to earn a good living, not to be handed one.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FRYDENBERG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  It is a pleasure to follow my good friend the member for Bennelong in speaking on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015. If we look at the debate in Australia at the moment and in recent weeks, it has been preoccupied with attacks on both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, their wives and their children, a wink here and a cigar there, and a harmless dance or a harmless song. These things have been blown completely out of proportion and have become the centre of debate, when really the media should have treated them for what they were and left them on the margins. In the days after the budget, we should have been debating its key themes and messages—what this budget is all about. It is about setting up Australia for a more prosperous future where our children and our grandchildren will be better off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To me, there are two key themes in this budget. The first theme is about paying back Labor's debt and the second theme is about putting in place measures and initiatives that boost Australia's economic growth, productivity and, most importantly, jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us take this first issue of paying back Labor's debt. Treasury's numbers are instructive: under this budget, over the next 10 years, nearly $300 billion of Labor's debt will be repaid and nearly $16 billion a year in interest will be saved. We have to put Labor's $667 billion worth of debt and record deficits, the biggest this country has ever seen, in context. When we left office at the end of 2007, there was zero government debt, there was a $20 billion surplus and $50 billion in the bank, real wages had increased by more than 20 per cent and millions of new jobs had been created. That was the proud fiscal legacy of John Howard, Peter Costello and their entire government. Labor were bequeathed this golden fiscal legacy but destroyed it in a matter of years. As a result, we had to introduce a series of tough measures in this budget which will see nearly $300 billion repaid. Right now, as the member for Bendigo and the member for Longman, who are in the chamber, know, Labor's interest bill that they left us is $1 billion a month. That pays for Gonski. That pays for the NDIS. That is an East West Link or a WestConnex project. That is just the interest bill on Labor's debt. So that is the first job of this budget—to pay back Labor's debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second element of this budget is to boost economic growth, jobs and productivity. We have done that in three ways in this budget. The first measure is a record investment in infrastructure, particularly roads—$50 billion of the Commonwealth's money, including $5 billion which will incentivise the states to recycle their own infrastructure, to sell it, to upgrade it and to ensure that they have the best infrastructure available for their constituents. In total, $125 billion worth of infrastructure will be kick-started by measures in this budget, creating tens of thousands of jobs right around the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second measure in this budget designed to boost economic growth, productivity and jobs is a record investment in education, innovation and research, with a $20 billion medical research future fund, which will be the envy of the world—and the member for Bendigo knows it will be appreciated by her constituents. We understand that Australia has a natural strength in medical research and I know that in Victoria, my home state and the member for Bendigo's home state, we have great research institutions like the Burnett institute and the Walter and Eliza Hall institute—and there are many in New South Wales too. These will be the direct beneficiaries of the $20 billion medical research future fund. For the first time, in this budget we are giving Commonwealth support to people who go to TAFE or take a sub-bachelor degree or a diploma, and we are giving up to $20,000 in a HECS-type of loan to apprentices. We say to the constituents of Australia that if the Commonwealth is prepared to support people who go to university, it should also be prepared to support people who undertake an apprenticeship. Twenty per cent of that amount will not have to be repaid if they complete their apprenticeship. We are boosting support for people who take up sub-bachelor degrees and diplomas and go to TAFE, we are giving greater support to people who undertake apprenticeships and we are investing in world-leading medical research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third element of productivity and jobs growth in this budget relates to the efforts we have under way to boost workforce participation for the under-30s, the over-50s and women. Those who are under 30 and have the capacity to work should not be on welfare—they should be earning or learning. For the over-50s who have been on welfare for more than six months, we will give an incentive to employers of up to $10,000 to take these people on board and give them a job where they become net contributors to our society. For women, we have an appropriate and far-sighted paid parental leave scheme which will take the place of Labor's mickey mouse paid parental leave scheme, which will hopefully keep many more women in the workforce after they have had children. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are the two main aims of this budget—paying back Labor's debt and boosting productivity growth and jobs. If you read the Commission of Audit, if you listen to the International Monetary Fund or you listen to the independent Parliamentary Budget Office, you will know that business as usual is not an option. Australia cannot continue on its current trajectory of spend, spend, spend instead of save, save, save. That is why we have these measures in this budget. I want to quote to you the National Commission of Audit, because its diagnosis was alarming. It found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The fiscal situation is far weaker than it should be and the long-term outlook is ominous due to an unsustainable increase in expenditure commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This problem of expenditure commitments is being compounded by the fact that we have an ageing population. Today, the number of people who are working for every retired Australian is five; by 2050 it will have fallen to just 2.7 people who are working for every one retired Australian. That is what compels us to take action today.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr FRYDENBERG:</span>
                    </a>  As I was saying, if we look at five of the most controversial or discussed and debated aspects of this budget—the Medicare co-payments, pensions, university deregulation, school and hospital funding—and some of the other areas, you could have thought, by the hue and cry from the Labor Party, that we have taken away the safety net altogether. Far from it. If you look at the Medicare co-payments, Australia is following down the path of European countries, Scandinavian countries, New Zealand and the Americas in having a co-payment of this kind. In fact, there is a cap of 10 visits on the co-payment for concession card holders—and in Australia there are more than eight million concession card holders—as well as people under the age of 16. For these people the $7 co-payment will be limited to just 10 visits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at pensions, pensions will go up twice each and every year. If you were to wind the clock back to 1908, when the pension first came in, the life expectancy for a 15-year-old male was 64. He never was going to get the pension. Today the life expectancy for a 15-year-old male in Australia is around 80 years of years age and for a woman it is 85. It is a much different circumstance and this needs to be reflected when it comes to pensions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at university deregulation, you could be forgiven for thinking that students were paying every dollar up-front. In fact, they do not pay a dollar up-front; they only start to pay back their HELP or HECS loan when their income reaches $50,000. What is more, our new measures will ensure that $1 in every $5 taken by a university as a result of deregulation can be put back into Commonwealth scholarships to help those from regional areas and others of lower socioeconomic advantage. When you look at health and school funding going forward, rather than it being cut it will, over the next four to five years, go up: 37 per cent for school funding and 40 per cent for hospital funding—a significant increase. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at other aspects of this policy, like the 'earn or learn' for under 30s, there are important carve-outs to ensure that if a young person does not have the capacity to work for more than 30 hours, or if they are a principal carer, if they are a parent or if they have a disability, then they are not going to be subject to these new 'earn or learn' requirements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you listen to the state premiers and the chief ministers talking about losing $80 billion, you would not have known that in fact the states are going to benefit by a total of $60 billion over the coming 10 years—an extra $60 billion in Commonwealth money flowing to the states over the next 10 years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had to take the tough measures in this budget because Labor bequeathed us a fiscal mess. Unemployment increased on their watch. Youth unemployment—as the member for Longman knows—went from 19 to 27 per cent under Labor, and we saw a fall in productivity and Australia's economic growth lag behind the world. We are determined to turn that around. This budget is part of a broader economic narrative which includes deregulation, industrial relations reform, tax reform, getting rid of the carbon tax, getting rid of the mining tax and reviews into competition policy and into the financial system. This is a good budget; this is an important budget. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">WYATT ROY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  It is always a great pleasure to follow the eloquence of the member for Kooyong. He and I have had many discussions about this budget. Just down the hallway in another room, the federal Treasurer is concluding his press conference updating the country on the national accounts figures. I will use this opportunity to update the House on those figures as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the national accounts figures show is that our strong economic action strategy is working, a strategy that recognises that growth and prosperity in this nation come from the private sector, not from a big, overbearing and intervening government. The national accounts figures that the Treasurer is updating the nation's media on now show that there has been 3.5 per cent growth over this year. Significantly, this growth has come predominantly from the non-mining sector. We have seen the smallest current account deficit since 1980—that is 10 years before I was born. Household spending is up, which shows that confidence is returning to the Australian economy. Most significantly, since the beginning of the year there have been 106,000 new jobs created, with 79,000 new full-time jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What all this shows is that our economic action strategy is working. We are removing barriers to private sector growth and investment, whether that is getting rid of the carbon tax, the mining tax or over $1 billion in red tape every single year. We are freeing the private sector of our economy up so that it can grow, prosper and employ more people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look at the economic narrative of our nation, it is important to see where we have come from and where we are going. In 2007, when the former coalition government left office, there was a $20 billion surplus, there was $50 billion in the bank and all of Labor's debt had been paid off. Then the Labor Party came to power and we saw our spending increase at the fastest rate of the 17 advanced IMF economies. We saw our debt increase at the third-highest rate of the 17 advanced IMF economies. That was money borrowed against the next generation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where are we now? If we had not acted, the way we are acting in these bills before the House and the way we have acted through the federal budget, the debt would have reached $667 billion. The interest repayments on the debt this year alone will be $12 billion and that would have gone to $17 billion a year if we had not acted. Those are big figures, so let us put them into perspective—what it means for everyday Australians across the nation. The level of debt would have reached over $24,000 for every single man, woman and child. This year, the interest on the debt bill will be $500. If we had not acted, as I said, the interest bill would have risen to $17 billion a year, or over $1,200 for every single man, woman and child. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $12 billion in interest this year alone—money that is effectively dead money—would have funded the complete $8 billion upgrade of the Bruce Highway, the complete $1.2 billion upgrade of the Gateway Motorway and a $2 billion new tertiary hospital for Queensland—and we still would have had hundreds of millions of dollars left over. That is the real cost of the interest we are paying. That is what is our nation is missing out on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Kooyong pointed out, before we deal with our nation's significant debt burden, that $24,000 debt that all Australians owe, we have to deal with the challenge—and I say it is a challenge, not a problem—of an ageing population. Today, as the member for Kooyong pointed out, there are five people working for every one person in retirement. By 2050 that will reach only 2.7 people for every person in retirement. The percentage of the population aged over 75 will go from about six per cent of the population to over 14 per cent of the population. And what the Productivity Commission has said is that if we do not do anything, taxes would have to rise by 21 per cent to fund them, and that is before we get to that $24,000 bill for every man, woman and child. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So as a nation we have to make a choice, and that is what this budget is about. Do we say that the problems we have inherited are too hard? Do we say that we will simply run up a greater credit card bill and hand that over to the next generation? Or do we say that as a government and as a country we live within our means so that what we hand over to the next generation of Australians is a nation with as much if not more opportunity than we currently inherit. If we do not, a young Australian growing up in the decades to come will be born with that $24,000 debt bill. They will be born with the need to pay at least 21 per cent higher taxes, and they will be born in a nation where the government does not have the ability to invest in roads and schools and hospitals across the decades to come. I am not prepared to be part of a government that says that the challenges we face as a nation are all too hard, that we are not prepared to make difficult decisions today and that the next generation will pick up the bill. Those are the choices we have to make in this budget and I am proud to say that I am part of a government that is prepared to take on this challenge so that future generations can inherit a nation with greater prosperity and greater opportunity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But beyond simply living within our means, we have to go for growth in the private sector. Since coming to government, that is exactly what we have done and that is what those job growth figures demonstrate. We have moved to cut the carbon tax. We have moved to abolish the mining tax and we are cutting over a billion dollars of red tape every single year, from small business predominantly. In my electorate—and I have specific examples where we have gone literally door to door with local businesses—we have found those overbearing and intervening and unnecessary regulations placed on small businesses and we have removed them, saving local businesses thousands of dollars a month so that they can go out and thrive and prosper and employ more people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the role of the private sector, and it is the role of the government simply to stop being the problem. Beyond that, where the market is not best placed to do so, I believe that it is the role of government to invest in those productivity-increasing measures, those vital pieces of infrastructure that our nation needs. In this budget there is over $50 billion invested into infrastructure, which is great for jobs, great for the economy and great for commuters across our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, the Bruce Highway is the great arterial that links our region to Brisbane and to the growing population in our north. It is the economic driver as much as the social driver of our region. In this budget we are investing over $3 billion between the Pine Rivers and Gympie, which will see significant upgrades across that highway and benefit local commuters and local families. We are investing over $16 million into the D'Aguilar Highway. As locals know, this has been a death trap for many years and inaction by the former Labor government resulted in much more tragedy on that road. It is a great matter of pride that after campaigning in 2010 and finally coming to government in 2013, I and the coalition government are able to deliver $16 million for that road. So on the infrastructure front we are investing significantly so that we can go for growth, we can create the jobs and we can see economic productivity lift. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are also at the individual level creating amazing new opportunities, particularly for young people across our nation to find the jobs of the future. We are creating for the first time ever the same opportunities for young people going to TAFE to get a diploma or an advanced diploma for a trade that are applied to a student going to university. If you go to achieve a diploma or an advanced diploma—and often these are people from the most disadvantaged background—you will not have to pay a single dollar upfront. This is the first time ever for our nation. In fact you only pay back the loan when you earn over $50,000, the same rule that applies to higher education. If you decide that you want to become a tradie, we are saying that we will give you $20,000 as a HECS-style loan to get you through your apprenticeship so that you can go on and find meaningful employment in the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="1K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BILLSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Small Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  Thank you, Acting Deputy Speaker, and it is great to see you there. You look very resplendent. It is my honour and privilege to rise in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015 and related bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget delivered some weeks ago was a crucial statement of the challenges we are facing and the action we need to take. Not only did it present all of the financial details Australians rightfully expect but it did so with an honesty and an integrity that has been lacking in recent years, in terms of budget numbers and predictions. Beyond the reliability, the integrity and the genuine disclosure in the figures presented by our Treasurer, this budget is the first Abbott government budget. It heralds a change of direction—an important change of direction we need to pursue. It will be this government; it will be our generation; it is at this time we need to make some choices. I believe the choice to commit ourselves to strengthening our nation's future, improving the prospects of our citizens and underwriting the quality of life and security we all expect and hope to enjoy into the future is the direction we need to turn in. That is why this budget is such a significant and important statement of our strategic direction. Together we will put behind us the profligacy and the populism of the previous government and pivot to a new era of prudence, purposefulness and prosperity, where we put in place the fundamental building blocks of a strong and growing economy and a safe and secure future. That is what the budget is about; that is what these bills are about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are not easy choices. But they are ones we have to make if we are to fulfil the promise of a nation where our sons and daughters can reach for a better life—a better life like the one we aimed for; a better life like the one that our parents hoped for for us, and that they worked for and enjoyed. We need to make decisions today to give current and future generations the same opportunity and the same realistic chance that we love about our nation. Together we can generate the wealth we need to sustain the extremely important social and income safety net—the safeguard for those who need that support. We can generate the wealth we need to underwrite the living standards of all Australians: those who have made their contribution in the past, those who continue to make their contribution today and those who are unable to provide for themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our actions and decisions, captured in this budget, will ensure we can invest in important productive infrastructure—like the East West Link Tunnel in my city, Melbourne—not only to carry commuters but to carry commerce. Those arteries of enterprise need to be invested in and that is what this budget is about. We are making sure we can finance the important works and services that our citizens expect from their government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also seeking to invest today to make sure the quality of life and the opportunities that are the envy of the world are there for our citizens into the future. Growth and prosperity matter because they give us the means to support the quality of life we are aiming for. This budget seeks to ensure that quality of life is buttressed; that it is available, secure and in reach not just for today but into the future, so that future generations can enjoy the opportunities those before us have enjoyed. That will involve us all making a contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know some have not needed to give the opportunities our nation has offered us a second thought. But now a second effort is needed from many of us to make sure that same potential and those same possibilities are available for all our citizens. That is what this budget is about. It is not just about the numbers, as accurate, truthful and honest as they are. It is about setting up this nation for the generation now and the generation to come, so we can sustain economic growth and those boundless opportunities that put a sparkle in my eye and a fire in my belly. We want to make sure that those boundless opportunities are there for the generations to come. But we need to do those hard yards now. We cannot postpone them. We know that making this choice, and this pivot to a more prudent, more prosperous and more purposeful nation—we need to do that at some point. Do we do it now, while those adjustments are modest and can be implemented so as to not cause great shocks to the economy and to our way of life? Or do we wait until they are so critical and so compelling that they cause enormous dislocation? I choose doing it now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I travel around my electorate—and I am been pleased to be have been elected seven times by my community—so often I hear calls for leadership, for a longer-term perspective, and for a government that is prepared to address the reality of the challenges that we face and to put the building blocks in place for the future—not to go around as if governing is like some kind of kid's party, where every child gets a prize no matter what they do. This is about the work that needs to be done now to make sure that that potential and those opportunities are in place—so that people, through their own work, effort and enterprise, can make the most of them. I choose to accept that challenge: to make those choices now, and to invest now for our future—to underwrite the opportunities and the living standards we expect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget also articulates an important economic action strategy: to build a strong and prosperous economy. That will give us the safety—as a nation that is proud and able to pay its way; able to make our choices and not be pushed around by the whims of circumstance—and the security to know that we can maintain those important safety nets and support services, and the way of life that we enjoy. It does call on all of us to make a contribution; to build our workforce, to encourage participation and to get the economy growing. Wasn't it great to see those national accounts showing that the economy is now growing at a trend growth rate? That is something that we were denied under the previous Labor government. This is about the opportunities that we need for the future. It is about a path back to surplus—not a fiction, not some headline, but the hard work to deal with the economic and budget challenges that we face—and, more particularly, it is about slashing $300 billion off the projected debt that this nation would have if the policy settings Labor left us were left in place—that is, $300 billion less lead in the saddlebag that our economy need not carry, and that our citizens today and into the future need not service through interest charges and debt servicing. The Treasurer has made it clear: doing nothing is not an option. I do not think that is even contested now. We have seen the Parliamentary Budget Office embrace the concept of the need for change and the need to do it now. We have learned that the former Treasurer was telling former ministers—Minister Carr—that the budget was in a mess. We have even heard that the current Leader of the Opposition—known to be 'Captain Complaint', and to harvest grievances rather than do the hard work and put in the effort that is required to shape a better future—even he—says there is a task to be done. We are up for doing that work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the budget strategy, there are many measures that are of great relevance to my community, and I will touch on those shortly. What is good for all of us is getting those broader economic settings right, and making sure that we are living within our means and targeting our support where it is needed. People in the small business community of Australia know that you cannot keep paying your overdraft interest bill on your credit card and expect everything to be rosy. They know that if you hope to leave the family enterprise to the next generation, you cannot saddle the business with extraordinary debt that limits its options into the future. Just as small business owners know that, and just as households understand that logic, the nation needs to address the reality as well. That is what this budget actually does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the support that we have had for tackling the challenges that have to be dealt with now. We did not create this mess. We did not set the nation on a trajectory that was only going to end in heartbreak and tears. We have dealt with the challenges, and we have an action plan to get us out of the hole that Labor was digging us all into. I am encouraged—I have heard the Business Council of Australia talk about its view of the budget. It said: 'Working from a very difficult budgetary starting position, the government deserves credit for taking important steps to confront the long-term challenges Australia faces from an ageing population.' Infrastructure Partnerships Australia also addressed the issue of shifting some of our outlays from consumption to investment—preparing for the future. In a reference that I am particularly heartened by, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: 'The budget goes a long way to restoring all-important business confidence that will drive investment and job creation, particularly for Australia's two million small businesses that employ some seven million people.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have shared with this chamber that under Labor 519,000 jobs were lost in small business. That is part of the legacy that saw Labor end up with 200,000 more people unemployed at the end of their term than was the case at the beginning. But rather than just recognise that and lament the lost opportunities, we are purposefully tackling the problems that Labor created and turning around that momentum. In the budget there are a number of very particular measures designed to assist small business. Getting the economy right and the broader economic settings right are crucial for all small businesses, and that is why the budget repair and the economic action strategy are so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are also particular measures. The company tax cut: 800,000 small businesses are structured as companies, and they will welcome that 1.5 per cent reduction in the company tax rate as a clear statement of encouragement to invest, to grow, to employ. The small business and family enterprise ombudsman measure: again, a practical measure to problem solve, to help small businesses navigate government programs and the opportunities for support, and to get access to reliable information. The concierge for problem solving, fixing Commonwealth procurement so that you can actually have half a chance of winning some Commonwealth work if you are smaller enterprises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding the ACCC: earlier today in another place, in Senate estimates, the ACCC chairman, Rob Sims, described the budget position that Labor had left the ACCC as 'diabolical'. It was technically insolvent at the time of the election. It was scheduled to run out of cash by April this year. It needed an injection of over $90 million this current financial year and to fund the ACCC in the out years just so that it could keep doing its crucial work to support consumers and to protect their interests and to ensure there is a fair and competitive economic environment. The unfair contracts measure is to make sure small businesses are not disadvantaged by take-it-or-leave-it standard form contracts that big businesses foist on them and then say, 'Take it or leave it because you've got no option', but leaves those small businesses in a very vulnerable and risky circumstance, unable to shape their own economic choices. The restart measure is an incentive for mature-age jobseekers to bring them into employment. Small businesses know mature and experienced staff are crucial to their success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The refocusing of the EMDG program for export support; ethics work to make sure it is there to support small business. The paid parental leave scheme—what a great measure. What great measure to see small businesses able to offer their staff the kinds of parental leave support big corporates and governments have been offering for years. I do not know why Labor are opposing that. Do they only want to look at work conditions in big corporates and in government? Is that where the unions only pay an interest? Is it because these are not union jobs and so they are not interested? But they are great jobs, and that is why we are trying to make sure a job in small business is supported and has the kinds of benefits and appeal that you see in bigger corporates. The way in which the entrepreneurs infrastructure fund will work will be to better target the support for small business. The ongoing funding for the Small Business Support Line and the Small Business Advisory Services: these are very important measures that say we value small business, we take your interests seriously, we partner with you in the opportunities and the livelihoods that you provide and you can count on us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a local level, I am pleased the budget funded a number of election commitments, such as the investment in the Frankston foreshore. I know you are from a great city on the coast, Mr Acting Deputy President Ewen Jones; so is Frankston. It is the Riviera of Melbourne. We are blessed to be a major metropolitan centre and you can go to sleep at night with the sound of waves—a tantalising offer, and that is something we are investing in. Support for our youth through the funding commitment to the Mornington youth; making sure our commercial centres and our shopping areas are saved by a $759,000 investment through the safer streets campaign for improved lighting, CCTV and anti-graffiti measures. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is funding for tourism directional signage down on the Peninsula Link. Great news earlier this week: P&amp;O have recognised you might want to go to Vanuatu, you might want to go to those cities, but where do you really want to dock on a cruise? You want to dock in Mornington. So we have P&amp;O cruises heading from Queensland down to the Riviera of Melbourne and docking at Mornington. When people get there they will want to know where all of those delicious attractions are, and that is why we need good tourist directional signage. There is also support for the Men's Shed, the Frankston Park Dolphins function centre, getting the aths track fixed at Ballam Park, investment in the war memorial, improving and expanding the oncology day treatment centre at the Frankston Hospital: all of these things are funded in the budget, and that is why the budget is great for the Dunkley community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the few minutes left I want to talk about one other area—the higher education reforms. I have spoken in this place a number of times about the vision I have for Frankston, the Fremantle of the east coast, the educational hub that builds from the great strengths of Monash University having a campus—and I declare that I am the chairman of the community advisory council—and the Chisholm Institute of TAFE. They offer good quality courses but not the variety our citizens need. Unfortunately, only 9.4 per cent of the population of Frankston city have postsecondary education in terms of bachelor degrees or qualifications above. It is 12.1 per cent in the Mornington Peninsula shire. The previous Labor government ran around talking about their policy target of 40 per cent of the Australian population aged between 25 and 34 having those qualifications. It was great to say, but they did nothing to follow through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have put forward the proposition of a polytechnic, a university college, that takes the great strengths of those two existing education providers but says: 'You don't need a spectacularly great ENTER score. You can invest in yourself, as we will invest in you through these higher education reforms. You can get the qualifications you need.' It will offer all kinds of courses by a range of providers on a real-time, open campus, co-hosted by those two great institutions. That is a vision for the future. It is great that our higher education reforms support that as well. I know you are excited, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am positive, pumped and very persistent about this too.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="241586" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SUDMALIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  I rise today on the 2014-15 budget to inform the House of my first nine months as the federal representative of the great people of Gilmore. As every parent knows, nine months is a significant period for any new individual to present themselves to the world. It is a period of anticipation and planning, culminating in an often painful delivery. That initial pain subsides as you work and grow with the new family member and all they contribute to the family's future. I am proud to speak today on the appropriation bills that are currently before this House. I am proud because it is a budget that delivers a strong, prosperous economy and a safe, secure Australia. These actions and economic choices reflect the reason I wish to represent the community of Gilmore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a mother and grandmother I recognise that actions today will mean a better and brighter future for the grandchildren of us all. This budget encourages every Australian to contribute and build for our future prosperity as a nation, to participate and weave the social fabric of success for our children's children. It is a budget that takes the necessary steps towards structural reform, reform that if left unaddressed will leave our descendants with a shameful legacy of debt and financial depression. It is clear that the days of borrow and spend must come to an end. Now that we have seen the true state of the books that Labor left us, it is clearer still that the time to contribute and build must begin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Left unaddressed and without serious reform, the budget those opposite left us was spiralling dangerously towards gross debt exceeding $667 billion within 10 years. Let us think what $667 billion could do for Australia. We could build the long-awaited Brisbane-to-Sydney-to-Melbourne bullet train with $500 billion to spare and then we could update our network of national highways across the country to a minimum dual carriageway, highway standard, still with probably about $200 billion to spare. If we take another $50 billion away from that, and that is a new world-class hospital in 25 major cities and regional centres equal in size to Nowra or Ulladulla in my electorate of Gilmore, we would still have $150 billion left to spare. We could build about 50 bridges across the Shoalhaven River and we would still have billions left over. This is the magnitude of the debt and deficit legacy that Labor have left us. Just think on that for a minute.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a tough budget, there is no doubt. The electorate of Gilmore has one of the highest levels of mature and wiser Australians. We have also a high unemployment level and welfare dependence issues as well as transport issues. Our region is not unique. Many other regions across our nation have similar complex needs. Borrowing money against the future of our children is not the way to solve the long-term support; however, we must provide for those in our community of greatest need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all knew in September 2013 that Australia was in financial trouble, which was the most important, top-of-mind issue that caused me to stand for government and caused me and many Australians to vote for this government. After six years of a big-spend, big-debt government we knew we were in trouble. Up until now nothing had changed. We are still facing an extraordinary level of national debt. With $1 billion every month being borrowed to pay off the interest, it is like getting a credit card to pay off a credit card to pay off the mortgage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Solving the debt problem for Australia is not going to be easy. We are proud of our world standard health care, always maintaining a safety net and concessional assistance for those who are most vulnerable. The difficult proposal of a Medicare co-payment will help to maintain this very excellent support mechanism for many years to come. We want a universally accessible system of health care to lead far into Australia's future; we do not want to be unaffordable in less than 10 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, with life expectancy extended to people living into their mid-80s, we will need significant research to cure the many illnesses and diseases that become significant as we age. The establishment of the Medical Research Future Fund will be essential for our increased longevity and having quality of life as a priority. There are many in Gilmore right now who wish this medical research had been funded before so that their illnesses could be treated with less expensive medicines and possibly cured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the election, we committed to keeping age pensions out of contention for cuts. We have delivered on this. Pensions will rise every six months, just as they should. Before anything else, it needs to be reiterated that there will be no cuts or changes to pensions during this term of government. We have, however, proposed some structural changes to payments in Australia but, importantly, these do not come into effect until July 2017.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has made adjustments to a range of income supplements. We must keep in mind that these are not the primary source of income for a family. They were designed to help with some of the costs of raising a family. They were originally designed to support families on low incomes. This is not the case now. The government is tightening the eligibility for these payments at the highest end of the income scale. We all acknowledge that a family whose income is around $100,000 is not really in need of support. It is far better to keep support payments for those families whose income is so much lower.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me for a moment expand on what this budget has delivered for Gilmore. Before the 2013 election, the coalition and I made over $15 million worth of promises to the people of Gilmore, to be delivered if we were elected. I am proud to say that those commitments have all been confirmed, just nine months into my first term as federal member—and the proof is in this document. There is guaranteed funding of $10 million for the planning, design and engineering studies for the third crossing of the Shoalhaven River in Nowra, which is the economic artery for our region. Everyone in Gilmore knows why our bridge and our roads are important, and the commitment was established after lengthy discussions with the community and the local council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a Gilmore roads safety package involving over $5 million to fix various black spots and substandard roads across our electorate, including $2 million towards stage 2 of Turpentine Road, an important transit road between villages south of Nowra and north of Ulladulla as well as for accessing the very lucrative Canberra holiday market. I can now add that I have achieved an additional allocation of more than $2 million for more black spot funding and $2 million to complete the next stage of Ulladulla's Dunn Lewis Memorial centre. This is a hub for local youth and community initiatives which will eventually increase sports participation, youth training and tourism employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is $450,000 in grants to different councils in Gilmore to install CCTV cameras in trouble spots across the region. When you speak to small business owners who have been the victims of robbery, like Sue from Bomaderry, or an armed hold-up, like Bruce and Shirley in Kiama, or the business owners of East Nowra and Sanctuary Point where antisocial behaviour is getting out of hand, you really appreciate the benefit of CCTV cameras.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is $450,000 to help complete the next stage of the Jervis Bay 'round the bay' walk, something which, once completed, will be a jewel in the South Coast's already impressive tourism offering. There is $300,000 to begin restoration works on the historical Berry School of Arts, a popular function centre and working building. This funding will help restore the building so that it can more effectively be used by the community and raise funds for maintenance and other local groups. There is $300,000 to go towards local youth recreation facilities in the region. Eventually these funds will be used in the establishment of three separate use facilities. There is $20,000 in equipment grants for our PCYC and the Sanctuary Point Mens Shed. Every single one of these commitments was secured by me from the government after extensive consultation with my community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the commitments being approved, I have worked closely with the community to lobby the Commissioner of Taxation, through the Assistant Treasurer, to stop the GST being levied on relocatable homes. I have worked tirelessly with Manildra , the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry to help retain this vital local-manufacturing enterprise. It is an iconic industry in Gilmore that supports many local families as well as many farmers throughout the eastern states of Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have established the need for expanded mobile black-spot coverage. I have spoken at length with the Minister for Communications and related the unusual geography of Gilmore, necessitating the nomination of three separate sites. We have achieved the allocation of four Green Army projects in Gilmore—two in the Shoalhaven, one in Kiama and one in Killalea, part of the Shellharbour City Council area. These initiatives will assist some 40 young people into a work-like environment, creating an asset for the local community, learning valuable skills and developing a work ethic. Under previous schemes in Gilmore, a number of the Green Corps graduates were employed in landscape businesses. Some even set up their own businesses of removal of noxious weeds or bush regeneration.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having invited the Assistant Minister for Employment to the area, where we showcased our local businesses, not-for-profits and job-search providers, we worked hard with the minister and participated in the task force to establish the revamp of Work for the Dole. We achieved the goal of getting a phase 1 rollout of a Work for the Dole program approved for Gilmore. We already know that Work for the Dole is a proven, effective method to assist young people into the paid workforce. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a region where getting a job can be difficult, an essential first step is to get work experience, while these young people will have income support from the government. They will be asked to volunteer in local organisations. In these places they will get the necessary skills and experience that will open doors for paid work. These programs build self-esteem; at the same time they build on the volunteer capacity of our community. The budget is tough, but Gilmore is well placed to make the most of the changes and adapt, as it always does, and invest in their own human capacity to create a strong and sustainable financial future not only for the Gilmore community but also as part of the national effort to fix up our country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is determined to maintain a financial support structure that will operate for years and decades into the future. A single aged pensioner can still receive up to around $26,000 per year in direct benefits. A single-parent job seeker over 30 can receive up to $28,000 in welfare benefits. A low-income family only able to earn around $30,000 can receive up to $28,000 in help. There is support for those most vulnerable. There is a plan to continue this into the future. There is a vision to empower young people to volunteer their time and energy in return for their welfare. They can build skills and self-confidence, giving them a chance to step up the rungs of the ladder of employment, so they get paid. There are opportunities for apprentices to access financial help, to supplement their wages or other expenses, up to $20,000 over four years. We know that regional expenses are difficult for our apprentices and this will definitely help. In addition, when they are able to earn more than $50,000 they will only have to pay back $16,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are incentives for employers to take on employees over 50 years of age: up to $10,000 over two years. I have received many calls from our more mature job seekers who feel that age has actually been a disadvantage. But now there is a change that will inspire them to re-engage and it will encourage employers to finally give them a chance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a time to rebuild, renew and regenerate. We are all responsible for this massive task, but we are Australians first and foremost—tough, resilient and resourceful. With this budget, we can get our nation back onto its strong, financial foundations and, with the community's support, push Gilmore into new levels of prosperity.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MATHESON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  I rise today to speak about the government's 2014 budget and the impact it will have on Macarthur residents now and into the future. It is no surprise that this was a tough budget, one put together by a Treasurer who had the best interests of this country and all of its people in mind. Tough decisions were made, some that may not have been popular. Sometimes a government has no choice but to make unpopular decisions and changes to ensure the economic security and prosperity of a nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a very lucky country and we have much to be proud of and thankful for. However, there was a time when Australia's bank balance was a lot healthier than it is now, giving the government of the day more opportunities to give financial support to its people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's government is not in that position. The previous government ran up five record deficits and left $123 billion in future deficits. If we took no action, debt would have hit $667 billion. Every month the government is paying $1 billion in interest costs on Labor's debt. Imagine what this government could do with that interest alone to support families and pensioners in Australia? It is imperative for our future generations that we pay off this debt and fix the mess that the former Labor government left us with. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition understands that every cent we give to support families and pensioners in Australia comes directly from the pockets of taxpayers. We also understand the importance of supporting those most vulnerable and our pensioners who have worked hard and paid taxes all their lives. But if we want to continue our support for pensioners and families well into the future then we need to make sure our welfare system is sustainable. We need to promote a working culture where people who are able to work or study do so. We need to encourage people off welfare and into employment so that more people are contributing to our wonderful country. A fair and sustainable welfare system is one that encourages everyone who can work to work. Our system will create a more sustainable age pension so we can support older generations for many years to come. Under this budget there will be better targeted payments to those most in need. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget we have also taken a positive step to build infrastructure for the future, and when it comes to infrastructure some very positive things came out of this budget for the people of Macarthur. In fact this is the first time in six years that Macarthur has even been mentioned in the budget. Under Labor we were neglected for too long. In the budget the Treasurer announced millions of dollars in much-needed infrastructure being spent in Macarthur and Western Sydney. Funding allocated to projects in my electorate in the 2014-15 financial year include: $1.3 billion to the Northern Road, $1 billion for Elizabeth Drive, as well as upgrades to Bringelly Road and Narellan Road. The upgrade of Narellan Road was announced during last year's election campaign. In total the government has contributed $53 million to upgrade Narellan Road to a six-lane divided road to improve traffic flow and road safety. Anything that will result in lower commute times for my constituents and give them more time at home with their families is a great thing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this budget Macarthur also has three projects commencing in 2014-15 under the Community Development Grants Fund. These grants include: $500,000 towards artificial grass for Lynwood Park sporting fields, $335,000 for a new heating system for the swimming pool at Mater Dei's special needs school and $200,000 for Narellan Jets field upgrade. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Campbelltown City Council has also received $350,000 for CCTV cameras as part of the government's Safer Streets program. This is an important investment in the Macarthur region. As a former police officer, I know that the best way to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour is to prevent it occurring in the first place. Local residents and business owners have been concerned by increasing incidence of crime in parts of my electorate. Not only do these visible cameras make potential criminals think twice before doing the wrong thing, but they will also make a valuable contribution in increasing conviction rates by assisting police gather evidence and prosecute offenders. I would like to thank Campbelltown City Council and the Campbelltown police for supporting this initiative. Macarthur is one of the fastest growing regions in New South Wales so I am very pleased to see that this Liberal government is taking my electorate seriously and delivering the infrastructure we need to cope with this population boom. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this budget we will also make higher education more accessible by expanding support to pathway courses such as diplomas for those who might not yet be ready to do a full degree. Our government will also introduce a new Commonwealth scholarship program to boost equity of access for disadvantaged students. We want to ensure that Australian universities are not left behind by the rapidly improving higher education systems of our neighbours, particularly in the Asian region. To help create more opportunities for Australians to undertake higher education and ensure that Australia is not left behind, we will extend Commonwealth funding to all students in non-university higher education institutions studying bachelor courses, costing $448.9 million over three years. We will create more opportunities for students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds through our new Commonwealth scholarship and equity initiative. We will remove all HELP loan fees which are currently imposed on some students undertaking higher education and vocational education and training. We will maintain the Higher Education Loans Program, HELP, that sees taxpayer support for all students' tuition fees upfront, and we will provide support to all bachelor and diploma students in all higher education institutions and universities, colleges and TAFEs accredited to provide higher qualifications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the present time, the taxpayer pays about 60 per cent of the cost of a degree and the student, the graduate, pays about 40 per cent. These changes will move it to about 50-50 and, like everything we do, there is a policy reason for doing this. We want the system to remain sustainable. We want to be able to help students for many years and decades into the future. Essentially, we are going to lend the money to the student at the same rate that the government borrows the money, with a maximum rate of six per cent. This will ensure the system is sustainable. Under this system, if an institution decides to charge additional fees, then 20 per cent of that has to go into a scholarship fund. Professor Ian Young, Vice Chancellor of the ANU and Chair of the Group of Eight, a coalition of Australia's elite universities, spoke about the changes recently. He said that right now, when a student comes to university, they do not pay a cent up-front for their tuition fees. They will not in the future either, so there is no barrier in terms of tuition fees when one goes to university. He went on to say that the barrier for many students is living costs and that is what really hits poor students. He said that in the future we will have a scholarship fund to be able to give those students funds to be able to live, so there is going to be a greater capacity to assist disadvantaged students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately we need to make our higher education support system sustainable. We also want to help young people transition to work, and that is why we are introducing the Trade Support Loans for apprentices—to encourage more young people to take up a trade and complete their qualification. From 1 July 2014 the government will offer interest-free loans of up to $20,000 over the life of an apprenticeship. These loans will ease the financial burden and help increase apprenticeship completion rates. Those who complete their apprenticeship will be given a 20 per cent discount, so will only have to pay $16,000 for a $20,000 loan. Like HELP loans for tertiary students, the loans will be repayable once the apprentices are earning a sustainable income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is also honouring its commitments and investing $64.5 billion in government and non-government schools over the next four years. This is $1.2 billion more than the previous government would have spent over the forward estimates. We have met our commitment to provide funding certainty for schools over the next four years from 2014 to 2017. From 2013 to 2018, the total Commonwealth funding to all schools in Australia, as outlined in the budget papers, will have increased by 37 per cent, a $4.6 billion increase. Funding by the Commonwealth from 2018 onwards will continue to grow but it will be based on the consumer price index and enrolment growth. The key issue is where the money should be spent. We believe the key issues are teacher quality, increased school autonomy, a rigorous, up-to-date curriculum and increased parental engagement. Mr Gonski himself acknowledged recently that Australia has not been spending its money on the right priorities. We have also kept our election commitment to invest $243.8 million over four years to revitalise the school chaplaincy program. School chaplaincy supports young people in many local schools across Macarthur. These chaplains provide a safe and supportive influence for students, especially those doing it tough or at risk of dropping out of school. The government will also invest around $28.5 billion in childcare fee assistance for families over the next four years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also strengthening Medicare to ensure that all Australians can continue to access world-class healthcare services at an affordable price. Ten years ago the Australian government was spending $8 billion on Medicare. Today it is $19 billion and in 10 years time it is projected to be more than $34 billion. The taxpayer currently funds 263 million services per year, which are free to patients under Medicare. Clearly this is unsustainable. There is growing pressure on the health system from an ageing population, the increasing incidence of chronic disease and increases in cost generated by new technologies. We are making our health system more sustainable and investing in medical research. We want to ensure that Australia remains the best and healthiest place in the world to raise a family and care for loved ones. As part of our plan we are asking Australians to make a modest contribution to their healthcare costs through the introduction of a $7 co-payment for visits to the GP. Contrary to Labor's strong opposition to this $7 co-payment in the recent budget, in previous years senior Labor Party leaders championed the introduction of the user-pays system. Labor's contradictory and continuous opposition to these measures outlined in the government's budget runs the risk of directing Australia down the same destructive economic path that the previous Labor government took. Five dollars of the money taken from each patient will be put directly into the world's biggest medical research endowment fund. This fund will find the cures of the future and be funded by the government's health reforms. In my electorate there are many families caring for loved one with a life-threatening disease or illness. The government's hope is that this record investment in medical research will find cures and better treatments for all people suffering with long-term health issues and incurable conditions. By making a modest contribution to our healthcare costs when we visit the GP, we are contributing to a research fund that could find cures for things like cancer, brain tumours, cystic fibrosis, dementia, ovarian cancer, diabetes and many more life-threatening conditions. The contribution will be capped at 10 visits per year for Commonwealth concession card holders and children under 16 to protect more vulnerable patients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our population is ageing and we must also make the necessary changes to ensure our age pension system is sustainable and can continue into the future. The fact is that someone who retires today can expect to receive the age pension for about 20 years after retirement. Without policy change, our spending on the age pension is expected to increase by 70 per cent over the next decade. Over the past 100 years there has been little change in the pension eligibility age, yet over the same period the average life expectancy has increased by 65 years, to around 85 years of age. Our plan is to increase the age pension age to 70 by 1 July 2035. This gives Australians time to prepare for these changes. And, despite any scare campaign from those opposite, pensions will still increase under this government: from September 2017, we are indexing pensions to inflation rather than to wages. At the same time, eligibility thresholds will be paused for three years. This will assist with the rising cost of providing the pension, while ensuring that pensions keep up with the cost of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also introduced measures to help overcome discrimination against older and unemployed Australians, strengthening incentives for them to return to the workforce. The government will introduce a new wage subsidy called Restart to encourage businesses to employ Australians aged 50 and over who have been on income support for at least six months. From July this year, employers who hire an eligible mature-age job seeker on a full-time basis will be paid a subsidy of $10,000 over 24 months. We are expecting 32,000 mature-age job seekers to benefit from this program annually. This is a fantastic thing for people over 50 living in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Small- to medium-sized businesses in Macarthur will also benefit from this budget. We remain committed to cutting the company tax rate by 1.5 percentage points from July 2015. For large companies, the reduction will offset the cost of the government's paid parental leave levy. For up to 800,000 small- and medium-sized companies, it will provide a net boost to productivity. We have also introduced young job seeker reforms to help young people lead into employment rather than encouraging them to be on welfare. In order to reach their full potential, we believe young Australians who can work should be earning, learning or participating in Work for the Dole. By going to help young job seekers under the age of 30 to participate in JobSearch, the unemployment services activity is funded by the government for six months before job seekers receive Newstart or Youth Allowance. After six months, job seekers will be required to participate in at least 25 hours per week of Work for the Dole activities and will be eligible to receive income support for six months. However, young people who do not have full capacity to work, who are in education or training or who have a significant disability will all be exempt from these requirements, as will those with parenting responsibilities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Making these changes will foster a work culture in this country that we have seen in previous generations. These generations did not rely on welfare, but worked hard for the good of their families and for the good of the country. We need to move away from a welfare culture, where people do not take responsibility for themselves or for their families but rely heavily on government support. I know there are people in my electorate who are unable to work for legitimate reasons and who need support—and those people who legitimately cannot work will receive government support. But those who are able to work or learn will be encouraged to do so under these changes, so that we are all contributing to our economy and to the future of our families. Australia has been considered by many as a lucky country. I am sure that those generations who worked hard to make this the lucky country understand why this government is making these changes. We have made the tough decisions, to make our health, education and welfare systems more sustainable into the future, and to ensure that our children and our grandchildren will still have access to the support of the government for many years to come.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  I rise to bring the second reading debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015 and cognate bills to a close, and to thank those members who have made a contribution—including the member for Macarthur, who always makes an excellent contribution. He is a member with plenty of common sense, and he is joined by a lot of those on our side. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These appropriation bills seek authority from the parliament for expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2014-2015 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015 concern expenditure planned for the forthcoming income year. The total of appropriations being sought through these three appropriation bills is just under $88.4 billion. I would like to highlight just five proposed appropriations, relating to the delivery of the government's commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, over $28.3 billion is to be provided to the Department of Defence to support the defence of Australia and its strategic interests. This funding includes funding to deliver the government's election commitment to re-establish the Australian Defence Force Gap Year program. Military service is a noble endeavour, and encouraging young people to get a taste of life in the services once they finish school is an important part of continuing to attract new personnel to our Army, Navy and Air Force—and, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, being the member for Herbert, you would certainly know that. All new recruits at the Army Recruit Training Centre at Kapooka in my Riverina electorate go through that fine establishment for their initial training. So it is also very important to those people in the Riverina electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, just over $6.1 billion is proposed for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which includes appropriations for international development and a $200 million capital injection to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, just under $4.3 billion is to enable the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to manage migration and citizenship, support Australia's humanitarian obligations and manage the stay and departure of all noncitizens. Stopping the boats was one of our top priorities on coming to office, and it is a priority on which we have delivered. It has now been 167 days since we had an illegal boat arrival. In that time the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection has closed nine detention centres. That is saving money. More importantly, it is saving lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, just under $3.5 billion is proposed for the Department of Communications, including just over $3.2 billion to provide funding to continue to roll out the National Broadband Network. On coming to government we commissioned a strategic review to tell the truth about the state of the NBN. Labor significantly underestimated the cost and complexity of this project and committed to roll-out schedules that were unrealistic and inaccurate. But we are getting on with the job of delivering the NBN as quickly and cost effectively as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the subject of communications, I recently had the pleasure of welcoming the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, the member for Bradfield, to my electorate to witness, firsthand, the impact of mobile black spots on local communities and the Riverina generally—and specifically around Tumut and Narrandera.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor, I wrote numerous letters to the then Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. I do not recall ever actually receiving a response. But under the coalition government, electorates such as mine will benefit from the government's $100 million mobile black-spot program. That is just another example of how the coalition is delivering for rural and regional communities in a way that Labor never did.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifthly, just over $1.6 billion is proposed for the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, including funding for the government's new Bridges Renewal Program and the Roads to Recovery Program. Those are very important. In his budget-in-reply speech the opposition leader, the member for Maribyrnong, talked a lot about the forgotten people but did not once mention rural Australia. The coalition knows the importance of the role rural and regional Australia plays in underpinning the productivity and prosperity of the country. That is where our food comes from. That is where our mineral wealth comes from. That is why we will invest in road and rail infrastructure to help expand the capacity of our regions to grow and thrive. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard Labor talking a lot about our regions just merely surviving. We do not want our regions merely to survive; we want them to thrive. The budget also confirmed funding for the coalition's Safer Streets Program, where proceeds of crime will be directed to fund local crime prevention projects for closed circuit television. This was a key commitment I made to my electorate, and I was able to assure Wagga Wagga residents that the $500,000 promised will be delivered under this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Appropriation Bill (No. 2) would also increase the general drawing rights limit for general purpose financial assistance payments to $5 billion. And the general drawing rights limit for National Partnership payments would increase to $25 billion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2013-2014 and Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2013-2014 are the supplementary additional estimates appropriation bills, and they are seeking authority from the parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for this financial year. I would like to highlight two areas relating to the delivery of the government's commitments that are supported by these bills. First, just under $662 million is proposed for the Department of Defence, reflecting several matters. Those include supplementation for Operation Southern Indian Ocean, Defence real estate sales, expenditure brought forward to assist with certain purchases, and supplementation for foreign exchange movements. Second, just over $306 million is proposed for the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, primarily for off-network roads projects, where milestones have been reached much earlier than anticipated. The total appropriations being sought through these two appropriation bills is just over $1.3 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Denison would have the parliament reject the government's budget. He would have the parliament vote against this package of bills, apparently to send us back to the drawing board. He has called on the crossbenchers and the opposition to support him in what I would call a futile crusade—a try-on. My understanding is that the opposition, to its credit, intend to follow convention and vote for these bills. So, in this place at least, the member for Denison will be engaging in what is merely a tokenistic gesture. However, I think it is worth being clear about  the practical effects of what the member for Denison actually proposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone considering the member for Denison's advice would do well to bear in mind that three-quarters of total Australian government expenditure, including the age pension, the disability support pension and the Newstart allowance, is made through special appropriations under distinct legislation, not the appropriation bills before us now. Arrangements by which students repay their Higher Education Contribution Scheme debts are similarly dealt with under stand-alone legislation. Tax changes can also be given effect to through separate legislation. What these appropriation bills do, however, is fund the ongoing business of government. Without the passage of these bills, departments and agencies will not be funded to do things such as process applications for the age pension, the disability support pension and the Newstart allowance. They allow tax returns to be processed and advice to be given by the Australian Taxation Office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any members and senators planning on supporting the member for Denison in his bid to make 2014 the first year since 1975 when parliament has refused to give the government of the day money to fund public services should think about what that will mean for their electorate, their state and the Australian people as a whole. Anyone supporting that will have people turning up to their office asking why they would not support the local Centrelink office to stay open, why they did not think the Australian Taxation Office was worth funding and why they cannot get their application for the aged pension, disability support pension or Newstart allowances processed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget sets us on a credible path back to surplus. It is a budget built on tough decisions, not on wishful thinking. If we did not make these tough decisions now, the budget would be in a much worse state, requiring much more stringent measures in the future. The people of Australia would quite rightly ask us in years to come why we did not have the courage to make the tough decisions in 2014. Without a drastic departure from Labor's tax-and-spend approach we would have remained on track to remain in deficit for at least the next decade, leaving us vulnerable to external shocks and ill equipped to cope with the challenges in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Deputy Prime Minister was asked on 15 May about how the budget was going to deliver for rural and regional communities, which are certainly important to me and to the member for Parkes, who asked the question in question time. The Deputy Prime Minister's response bears thinking about:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's record spend of $50 billion on an infrastructure package covers many regional roads that link to the national transport network.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Beyond this the Government remains committed to delivering the $2.5 billion Roads to Recovery Programme. This programme provides funding straight to local councils in order to improve local roads that the community identifies as priorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to this the Government will also provide $565 million to fix dangerous roads under the Black Spots Programme and $300 million for the new Bridges Renewal Programme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also committed to funding a $1 billion National Stronger Regions Fund which will help communities construct and improve infrastructure. This will in turn help to support livability and drive economic growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are very important things. I commend the Deputy Prime Minister, who is the Acting Prime Minister at the moment, given that Tony Abbott is overseas, for his commitment and his strident advocacy for rural and regional Australia, and certainly for supporting the National Stronger Regions Fund because it is so important to get the infrastructure in place to help drive growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our sensible budget, as we heard the member for Macarthur talk about, is in marked contrast with what Labor has to offer—no policies, no alternative and no hope; just more debt and more deficit. When Labor came into office they inherited a $20 billion surplus with no net debt and $45 billion in the bank. I think the member for North Sydney would be a little jealous of Peter Costello, because the Labor debt and deficit after the 1996 election that Peter Costello inherited from the Hawke-Keating era was absolutely nothing when compared to what we inherited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Between 2008-09 and 2012-13 Labor delivered deficits totalling $191 billion. Labor left additional projected deficits of $123 billion over the next four years, 2013-14 to 2016-17. Over six budgets Labor increased spending by over 50 per cent—$137 billion. You cannot keep maxing out the nation's credit card. It would not be responsible. It is what the Treasurer, Joe Hockey, has called intergenerational theft. It is absolute theft from our future generations. They would then be saddled with it. Our children and grandchildren would have to pay off the legacy left by Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The International Monetary Fund recently found Australia's spending is projected to grow faster than any of the 17 advanced economies it profiled. Labor's waste and mismanagement knew no bounds. There was a cost blowout of at least $29 billion with the NBN. There was simply no cost-benefit analysis ever done. There was the $6 billion to $8 billion—who would know?—blowout cost of overpriced school halls. It was a good project, but hopelessly managed. Although, I should say that perhaps only $8 billion was probably a pretty good achievement by Labor compared to some of the other things that it introduced. The disastrous pink batts program cost $2.8 billion and, sadly, cost four lives, including someone from my electorate. There were $900 stimulus cheques sent to around 27,000 Australians living overseas and, would you believe, 21,000 people who were deceased. What a waste of money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Treasury projects that without policy change, without doing anything, left unchecked, the budget will be in deficit for the next 10 years, which would mean 16 unbroken years of deficits—the longest stretch of deficits since World War II. Every time we look across—the member for Macarthur, every time you and I look across the chamber, we see the architect of this absolute disaster. It is the member for Lilley: supposedly the world's greatest treasurer, but the member of parliament who left us, who left not only the coalition but also Australia, with such a legacy of shame. Labor presided over the fastest deterioration of our debt position in modern history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The midyear budget update projects Australia will have $667 billion of debt in 10 years unless policies change—and they have changed. They changed the night the Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, delivered this budget. That is when they changed. That is when, as the member from Macarthur pointed out, the buck stopped. The buck stops with us, but the buck also stops with Australia—it has to. We have to get on with learning or earning; we have to get on with paying back this debt that we inherited and that Australians inherited. Each Australian's share of Australian government debt is currently $13½ thousand. That is bad enough, but unless we take action this will grow by $1,100 per year and reach $24,500 in a decade. This year Labor's debt will cost taxpayers more than $12 billion in interest payments. That is $1 billion per month in interest alone. It is like paying your credit card with another credit card. Australians cannot keep doing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot keep affording this huge debt. One billion dollars would build so many hospitals, so many schools—not just in rural and regional Australia but also in the metropolitan cities. With this interest bill alone we could build a world-class teaching hospital in every capital city or finish duplication of the Pacific Highway. How many lives would that save? This year's $12 billion interest debt is equivalent to around half of Australia's defence budget; the government spends around the same amount on aged care. Aged care is one of those areas that is so important, particularly with an ageing population.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In six chaotic years, Labor had two prime ministers, three deputy prime ministers and half-a-dozen small business ministers—and we heard our small business minister give such an evangelical speech before about how we are going to fix up the debt and deficit and how we are going to get Australia working again. We have heard the Prime Minister—the 'infrastructure Prime Minister'—say Australia is now open for business again. Indeed we are. I commend the budget; I commend the appropriation bills. And with that, I commend it to the House.</span>
