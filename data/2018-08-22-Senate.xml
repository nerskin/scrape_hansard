                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  These amendments moved by the government will essentially make it impossible for the banks to take advantage of the tax cuts. I just wish to speak briefly on my position regarding that. As a general principle, it is not at all good policy to regulate banks or any sectors of the industry via tax policy. The idea that you can discipline the banks or somehow teach them a lesson about their misbehaviour, as exposed in the royal commission, via tax policy is extremely bad policy. It is an extremely bad idea. Nonetheless, it is not quite as bad as the idea that a company with over $500 million in turnover should also be denied the advantage of lower taxes. That policy, which emanated, I gather, from Senator Hinch, is cockeyed—like many ideas that emanate from Senator Hinch—and I certainly can't be supporting that under any circumstances. That would be a tax on success. It would be signalling to companies: 'Don't get too big, otherwise we will punish you.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other hand, while the idea of exempting the banks from the tax reduction is a bad policy, I am willing to support it. I am willing to support it on the basis that the banks are big enough and capable enough of looking after themselves. The difference between the rate of taxes that the banks pay and the rate that other large businesses pay would only kick in in about 2026. I can envisage a situation where the banks are facing that scenario of paying 30 per cent tax, while all other companies are paying 25 per cent tax, and the banks would say: 'We can't sustain this. This is not acceptable.' So one bank one week would say, 'All right; that's 2,000 people who are now going to be made redundant.' That would gather quite a lot of headlines, and people would say: 'That's pretty bad. Maybe we've made a mistake.' Then a week later another bank might retrench 2,000 people. By that stage, people would be saying, 'That's really quite bad. I don't think we can continue with that.' And, if a third bank then says, 'Okay. We've got 2,000 people who we don't need either because of this high tax rate,' even if it was a Labor government in coalition with the Greens and they were inviting us to celebrate the socialist nirvana, they would find it politically unacceptable to be witnessing redundancies at that sort of rate.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I guarantee any government would back down and say, 'Okay, you can also have the tax cut.' On the basis that the banks are capable of looking after themselves—and I've just suggested one way in which they could look after themselves—I am prepared to accept that amendment from the government and vote for it. However, I signal that I absolutely will not be supporting the other amendment, which we'll be considering later today, which is to have a threshold for the tax reductions of $500 million in turnover—that is totally unacceptable.</span>

                    <a href="195565" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:35</span>):  I want to get a few comments on record in relation to these amendments. Firstly, the Greens have made it obvious from the start that we will be opposing any corporate tax cuts in this place. We have campaigned very strongly for tax cuts for small business in Australia. We took a policy to the 2013 election for tax cuts for businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million. We were proud to be part of the vote in this chamber that actually saw that happen. We did get tax cuts for hardworking, struggling Australian small businesses. That's something that we led on and we're proud that we actually legislated on. But we've made it very clear that we won't be supporting tax cuts for any business over $10 million, and our position hasn't changed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that we have two amendments before us today will not change our position. We will not be voting for either amendment to exclude the banks or to make tax cuts over $500 million, for the simple reason that we won't be doing anything to encourage the passing of these bills through the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say on the banks, no-one has worked harder in this place than the Greens to hold the banks in this country to account. We were the ones who started a campaign for a royal commission in 2014. We pushed that hard. It took us a few years, but we got the Labor Party on board going into the 2016 election. We put a parliamentary commission of inquiry bill, which became the Trojan horse in this place, to actually get the numbers to force the Prime Minister's hand. We worked with The Nationals, we worked with One Nation, we worked with the crossbench, I worked with the Katter's Australian Party, I worked with everybody to get this in place, and that royal commission has done a great job so far. There's still a long way to go, and we're hoping for some substantive changes to the banking sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no problem at all with us stinging the banks for more revenue. We campaigned since 2010 for a levy on the big banks. We got a levy on the banks in this government, and I'm proud that another achievement the Greens have been leading on has been passed into law. It wasn't big enough. We'd like to see it at least another 20 basis points to account for the too-big-to-fail implicit and explicit guarantees that we've seen in this country since the GFC to pay the Australian people back for some of the insurance that they've provided to the banks that have allowed the banks to earn super normal profits—excessive returns on capital and massive CEO bonuses. We'd like to see more money given back to the Australian people, and we think it's a consistent approach to increase that bank levy, at least 20 basis points, and raise revenue off the banks. While, in principle, we might support excluding the banks from having tax cuts, we're sticking with raising the bank levy as the best place to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I did mention yesterday very quickly, it does seem incongruous that we have a $500 billion cut-off for a large ADI in this legislation, whereas, in the bank levy legislation, we levied that on the big banks at $100 billion. I'm not quite sure why this arbitrary figure has been chosen at $500 billion. It excludes Macquarie Bank, for example, which is very disappointing. I'd like to see them also forgo their tax cut if that was to come into law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of tax transparency, once again I'm very proud to have been part of a party and a charge that was led by Senator Milne when she was here into tax transparency and tax justice, a very far-reaching Senate inquiry into this issue that we initiated. We worked very hard, once again, across party lines to get legislation passed in this place, including the MAAL bill and a number of things around tax transparency to actually make corporations pay their fair share. I don't think any of us in this building—and I certainly don't think any of the stakeholders we talked to or the Australian Taxation Office, which is still fighting to get money off big corporations—would agree that they're still paying their fair share of tax, because they're not. So how is cutting tax on companies that still aren't paying their fair share of tax a fair thing to do? We should be keeping up the fight. That should be our focus. We've been very clear about that in this debate. Our focus should be on getting money off these corporations in the first place. We'll continue to ask questions at estimates of the ATO about how they're going in their campaign to get tax justice through the courts and other measures. This needs to be the key focus of this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have completely disputed the evidence that somehow a race to the bottom on cutting tax is going to improve our economy. I've heard Senator Cormann talk about this ad nauseam in the last 24 hours. The evidence is not there in the US. There have been a number of people criticise and debate the Treasury modelling that has been put out or other government modelling that the government has shown. I asked Senator Cormann yesterday what would be the cost to the economy of excluding the banks, under the assumption that somehow this tax cut is going to grow revenue and cause economic growth. Of course, that wasn't even in the explanatory memorandum. That modelling hasn't been done. This is a pipedream.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This country needs to raise revenue. We can actually increase economic activity in other ways. At the last election we as a party put together a comprehensive plan for a government owned infrastructure bank and a financing mechanism to drive an infrastructure revolution in this country, which would create jobs and growth and set this country up for the next century. All this stuff is a blueprint and a plan to press reset for this country. The government have completely ignored that. They have completely squibbed infrastructure spending in this country, just like they have squibbed so many other things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to Senator Cormann, through you, Chair, that now is not the time to be voting on tax cuts for big corporations. The government are very likely to change in the next week and completely change their focus. Senator Cormann, you can laugh, but history tells us that this is very likely to be the case. This policy has no evidentiary basis. It is built on ideology. It is built on the donations by large corporations to the Liberal Party. We are debating this at this sensitive time because the Liberal Party want to be seen to be in this place fighting for their big backers. That's their lifeline in this place. Without those donations, they can't function effectively and run big election campaigns to continue to get re-elected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This tax bill has been dead from the start. It has never had support. Senator Cormann yesterday came in here and said that it's inevitable that this Senate will one day pass big corporate tax cuts. I say to Senator Cormann: there may be situations where I could see that happening—when we don't have a shortage of revenue in this country; when we don't have a government attacking the poor and vulnerable in Australia, trying to take money off those who desperately need it and our social safety net; when we are able to raise Newstart to help those on the poverty line live a better life and actually reinvest that money in our people; when we are not cutting funds to schools and hospitals; and when we don't have the same ideologically driven approach to attacking the vulnerable in this country. That might be a time when we can consider cutting corporate taxes, but now is not the time. There's so much more that we can do to increase economic growth in this country. We have made enough speeches and been on the record. I'll finish by saying that we won't be supporting these amendments.</span>

                    </a>  I think it is very important for the Austrian people to understand that the Labor Party in the Senate today voted in favour of tax cuts for the big banks. To the eternal credit of Senator Hinch, who has been consistent with his publicly stated position all the way through, he voted in favour of this amendment put forward by the government. To the eternal credit of Senator Leyonhjelm, who I know had policy reservations for good reasons in relation to this particular amendment, because he saw the bigger picture he voted for better opportunities for working Australians to get ahead by helping businesses around Australia be internationally competitive and so supporting our economy, supporting jobs and supporting opportunities for families to get ahead. He voted for this amendment. Senator Burston and Senator Anning are senators who are men of their word, and they voted in favour of this particular amendment. Of course, all of the Liberal Party and National Party senators in this chamber voted in favour of carving out the big banks from these corporate tax cuts, because we thought it was so important to secure a lower globally more competitive business tax rate for all of the other businesses around Australia that employ millions of Australians. Those who voted on this side of the chamber care about the opportunity for working families to get ahead, because we understand that their future job opportunities, future job security, future career prospects and future wage increases depend on the future viability, competitiveness and profitability of the businesses that employ them. That is why we voted in support of this amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party has lost all credibility. Mr Shorten actually knows that a lower globally more competitive business tax rate is in our national interest. Mr Shorten knows that a lower globally more competitive business tax rate will actually be in the best interests of workers—none other than Dr Ken Henry, as Treasury secretary to Treasurer Swan, said so, none other than Mr Shorten himself said so, and none other than Mr Bowen said so, until we decided to put this proposal into a budget. The only reason the Labor Party is opposed to business tax cuts now is that they believe that is going to be the pathway for Bill Shorten into the Lodge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My message to the Australian people is: if Bill Shorten is elected Prime Minister on his antibusiness, anti-opportunity politics-of-envy socialist high-taxing agenda it will hurt the economy, it will cost jobs and it will hurt working families around Australia, who will end up with less opportunity to get ahead. We will continue to fight for the best interests of working families around Australia. The Labor Party can continue to play politics. They voted, just now, in favour of tax cuts for the big banks. It shows how completely bereft you are of any credibility and any integrity. It is absolutely unbelievable. After the campaign that Mr Shorten has been running in Longman and everywhere else around Australia, the latest Bill Shorten lie is that he's opposed to tax cuts for the big banks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say this again very clearly and very slowly: every Labor senator in this chamber just voted in favour of tax cuts for the big banks. So you are now in favour of tax cuts for the big banks, instead of more money for hospitals, more money for schools. That is the position of the Labor Party. You are absolutely all over the place. Nobody can trust a single word that Bill Shorten has to say on anything. He lied about 'Mediscare'. He lied about the citizenship status of his own MPs and, of course, he lies when he says—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-OfficeContinuation">The CHAIR:</span>  Minister, resume your seat. I do remind you it is unparliamentary, firstly, to refer to those in the other place by their first names and, secondly, to directly accuse someone of being a liar. I would ask you to withdraw those comments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  I withdraw. Mr Shorten clearly misled the Australian people in relation to 'Mediscare', he clearly misled the Australian people in relation to the rolled-gold guarantee that he gave to the Australian people that there was 'nothing to see here' in terms of the citizenship status of his MPs, and he misled the Australian people when he said he actually cared about jobs. If Mr Shorten cared about jobs, he would help ensure that businesses around Australia have the best possible opportunity to be viable, competitive and profitable into the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the Labor Party has failed a test of character. With the Labor Party having campaigned, supposedly, against tax cuts for the big banks, every single Labor senator today voted in favour of tax cuts for the big banks. The people of Australia can form their own judgements.</span>

This is a leader in this place who has actually argued for tax cuts for the banks, has argued against a royal commission into the banks and has supported the banks all the way along. And now this government is in so much trouble and in terminal decline. We understand that Senator Cormann is committed. This is Senator Cormann's signature economic policy down the drain, like this government is down the drain. This is a bad week for the Australian public because this government is collapsing, and we need a government that can actually get decent economic policies, decent financial policies and look after working people. And that performance we've just seen from Senator Cormann demonstrates how much trouble this government is in.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The question is, really, if the public does not, with a Royal Commission on, like the idea of handing out big tax cuts to banks and others, why on earth would the Government persist with this?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did Senator Cormann say? What did the Leader of the Government in the Senate say? He said, 'Because it's the right thing to do.' Talk about wibble-wobble. He said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Because it is the right thing to do by working families around Australia. If we put businesses in Australia at a competitive disadvantage with businesses in other parts of the world by imposing significantly higher—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">then that puts workers here in Australia at a competitive disadvantage with workers in other parts of the world.</span>

When is he going to join him? And when is the end of this government going to actually happen? I hear that it's today. I hear that it's on again today. What we really should be doing is concentrating on the issues that are important for working people, not handing $80 billion to the big end of town while working people in this country need access to decent health systems and decent education systems. We want to rebuild the TAFE system in this country. That's where the money should be going—looking after working families, not $80 billion to the big end of town. </span>

You've only to got to look at the linkages between Goldman Sachs and this government. This is a government that really is dead. This government is dead. What we need is a government that can actually look after the best interests of Australians. The performance that Senator Cormann just put on demonstrates how bad this government is and how desperate it is. They're at each other's throats. We don't even know who's on the front bench. We don't even know if Senator Cormann will be there this afternoon. This is the correct decision. The big dummy spit that we've just seen from you, Senator Cormann, does you absolutely no justice. And I suppose you're sitting there looking at your phone now, seeing where the numbers are. They're falling away from Prime Minister Turnbull. We know that. We know this government is in such a bad state. </span>

These are the issues that are important for working people in this country, not your internal disputes, not your fights, not your squabbles and arguments that have destroyed this government. We understand how important unity is. What we stand for is a unified government, a unified Labor Party that can deal with the issues, not handing $80 billion of taxpayers' money to the big end of town on some crazy ideological theory that trickle-down economics will work. You guys have lost the plot. You opposed the banking royal commission. You want to cuddle up to Goldman Sachs. You want to cuddle up to all those big businesses that hand over money to you guys for your election campaign. I think you're going to be about a million and a half dollars down, because I don't think this Prime Minister, when he has been knifed completely, will be handing any money over to the coalition. </span>

We need a change of government in this country, because the performance we've seen at the highest levels of this government is that they've lost the plot. They've lost the plot completely. This was the best decision today for the Australian public, the best decision economically, the best decision so that when we are in government we can continue to look after the working people in this country and make sure that the big end of town pay their fair share of taxes and that they make a contribution to building a better society in this country, not a divided society. We've got a divided society under you lot. We've got a divided government. We've got a government incapable of governing. And the performance that Senator Cormann just put on demonstrates how desperate and how bad they are. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  Senator Cormann deserves his moment in the sun. He did today. When it comes to performances, Senator Cameron, you just voted in favour of the banks getting a tax cut if this bill goes through. I know it was a tactical deal, but you were there blustering away in your Scottish brogue at Senator Cormann—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator HINCH:</span>
                    </a>  Excuse me. Amendments were put forward by the government to exclude the banks, something I have been suggesting in this chamber and elsewhere since March of this year. The government today, through Senator Cormann, put forward amendments that would exclude the big four banks, the robber banks—whom you and the Greens oppose—and stop them getting the tax cuts if this bill goes through. Senator Cameron, you and Labor voted in favour of the banks getting tax cuts. You can dress it up as you like, but that's what you did this morning. That's what Senator Wong did. That's what Centre Alliance did. That's what the Greens did. One Nation have voted in favour of the banks getting a tax cut. I know it's tactical, but, on the record, you voted this morning in favour of the big banks getting tax cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the bill comes up, I will vote against it too, but at least the government's being consistent on my suggestion that they cut out the banks, the robber banks who've been stealing money from people for years. Yes, the government did oppose a royal commission. The royal commission, thanks to the Greens and Labor, was a great idea. With what they're pushing out there now and what the banks are being exposed for, they deserve to be punished over it. They are paying a levy. But, in terms of this morning's effort, put it on the record: the Labor Party, the Greens, One Nation and Centre Alliance voted in favour of the big banks getting a tax cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm hoping that, having rolled back on the banks, the government will now take the second half of my suggestion—that we should restrict the tax cut now to companies with turnovers of up to $500 million. If they want to give it to the other companies—to Goldman Sachs, as you mentioned, to Qantas, to Rio Tinto, to BHP—if they want to do that, if they think that's such a great idea, they should take it to the federal election. If they get re-elected when the election comes up, either tomorrow or next year—if the people vote in favour of the government and they get re-elected—I will look again at increasing the tax cuts for other companies. But that's down the track. In the meantime, I suggest that we go for the $500 million and then take it to the election if it's such a great idea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I say that I was sitting here quite surprised. Why the heck didn't Labor vote to knock back the banks this time round and then cross the floor again when it comes to the final vote? You're not being pushed into anything. For months you've said you don't want them to get the tax cuts. The Greens have said they don't want them to get the tax cuts. And yet you are now on the record as saying that the banks should not be excluded. There was an amendment that was quite specific that the four major banks should not get the tax cuts, and you voted in favour of the banks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that note, I think it might be time for me to move the amendments on sheet 8439, which say that these tax cuts for companies should be restricted to companies with turnovers up to $500 million. Last year the government agreed to this. I don't believe in a two-tier system. If Labor get to government at the next election, they're going to punish the small-business people by taking away their tax cuts that have already been legislated. They want companies with more than $2 million not to get those tax cuts. They may edge up towards $10 million. I think that's on Senator Wong's—</span>

                    <a href="HDA" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CORMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:08</span>):  I thank Senator Hinch for his contribution and for his support of our previous set of amendments. The government will not be able to support those amendments. Senator Hinch talks about going to an election. Well, we went to an election in 2016, with our Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan, proposing to lower the business tax rate for all businesses to 25 per cent over the 10-year period to 2026-27.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand the politics in relation to the banks, in particular in the context of the royal commission inquiry currently underway, but we maintain that it's critically important for our future economic security, our future economic prosperity and the job opportunities of millions of Australians today and into the future that we ensure that businesses here in Australia are competitive with businesses in other parts of the world. Imposing significantly higher taxes here than in other parts of the world puts businesses here and their workers at a competitive disadvantage with businesses overseas and their workers. You're right; that argument has been prosecuted for some time. But, as Bill Shorten eloquently argued when he was the Assistant Treasurer—he was right then—if you put in such a cap, which will become a permanent cap the way you are proposing to do it, at $500 million, you are providing a perverse incentive for business to downsize in order to stabilise the cap. The effect of your amendment is that, if a business which already has a track record of success approaches the $500 million threshold, it would be exposed to a five per cent increase in tax on 100 per cent of its profits as soon as its turnover goes above $500 million. That provides an incentive for bigger businesses either to become smaller businesses or for businesses below $500 million in turnover to remain below $500 million in turnover.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need to do through our tax system and through our policy settings generally is ensure that smaller businesses have the right incentive to become bigger businesses so that, as they grow and expand and pursue further opportunities to sell more of their products and services here and overseas, they hire more Australians than they otherwise would. As they hire more Australians than they otherwise would, the competition for workers across the Australian economy increases and that drives up wages. The additional capital investment that we attract on the back of a lower globally more competitive business tax rate helps drive productivity improvements which in turn also help to finance—help business to afford—the wage increases that we all want to secure. So, for all of these reasons, the government will not be able to support these amendments.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="AI6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  I just want to go to a couple of things here. Let's deal with this rant from Senator Hinch. Senator Hinch, it's got nothing to do with my accent; this is about policy. It's got nothing to do with where I come from. It's about policy and it's bad policy, and that's exactly what we are voting against here. We are voting against an $80 billion handout to the big end of town, to companies, some of them, that may not pay tax anyway. And the nonsense that we hear from Senator Cormann simply continues that argument—the argument that, if you provide tax cuts to big business, then workers will get a wage increase. It didn't happen in Canada; it didn't happen in the United States; it won't happen here. The only way workers will get a decent wage here is if we get decent industrial laws and workers can bargain effectively. That's the bottom line here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government are simply about looking after their mates in the big end of town. That's why they refused to have a banking royal commission. That's why they defended the banks constantly and for a long time. That is just not a proposition that the community are prepared to accept. If you want to defend, Senator Hinch—through the chair—the coalition on their key issues, you should just join the Liberal Party. You vote with them constantly. On all the key issues, you vote with the Liberal Party. You are not an independent on these issues; you are simply parroting the lines from the coalition. Just join them. Stand next time as a senator for the Liberal Party if you can get in. They are always looking for blokes. They don't do much with women so they will be okay with another bloke in there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a proposition we are prepared to agree to. We don't want Goldman Sachs to get a tax cut. We don't want the banks to get a tax cut. We don't want to give the private health funds a tax cut. We don't want to increase the executive salaries in this country, because we think the executive salaries are out of whack as it is. All this will do is fatten the wallets of the executives in this country. There will be no trickle-down to ordinary working people, absolutely no trickle-down. We take the view that there are other priorities that we, as the Labor Party, want to address—that is, to get proper funding into public schools, to make sure that we rebuild the TAFE system in this country so that we can become globally competitive in our manufacturing sector and to make sure that the health system can look after people when they need it. Yet this government wanted to hand $80 billion over to the big end of town.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't want to do that. We don't want to support what you are doing as a supplicant to the Liberal Party, simply pushing the line for them, trying to help them out. We don't want to do that either. We want to make sure that money in this country is spent on the priorities that are needed to build a decent society. And those priorities are the health system, the education system, looking after those that have fallen on hard times, making sure that workers can bargain effectively in this country, making sure that we deal with climate change and making sure that we deal with energy policy—energy policy that is pulling this mob apart, that has seen the demise of this government. Let's not kid ourselves—this government's gone; this government's finished. That's only epitomised by the former Minister for Home Affairs, out again this morning, from the back bench, saying that the company tax rates are dead; he will not support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What it looks like at the moment is that Senator Cormann's great mate, Mr Dutton, could be the next leader of the Liberal Party. Who knows what that's going to lead to. Already we're hearing that we could end up in a situation where some Nationals would split from the Liberal Party and deny supply. That would probably be a good thing. But, really, I take the view that if Malcolm Turnbull had any courage, any backbone, then what he would be doing is actually going to an election now: 'Don't have the humiliation of the extreme right—Senator Cormann's mates—knocking you off. Why don't you just go to an election now and give the public a choice about who they think should be doing the right thing?' And probably, Senator Hinch, you should actually ask whether you can stand on the Liberal Party ticket at the same time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take the view that there is such chaos. We've got a government which cannot do what a government should do, and that is govern. They're just not governing. They're too busy carving each other up. If you look at it this morning, not a Liberal or Nationals member have their head out of their mobile phones. They're seeing who is resigning next, where the numbers are going now and when is the next party room meeting to knock off the sitting Prime Minister. That's what's going on. This government has got no economic credibility. Senator Cormann has got no economic credibility as a minister, because his good mate, who's probably going to be the next leader, doesn't agree with his signature policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not going to hand money to big business to fatten executive salaries and do share buy-backs in this country, as has happened in Canada and the US, when we need to spend money on health, we need to spend money on education and we need to spend money on the VET system. We want a competitive economy, an economy that can actually compete with the rest of the world. That's what the focus should be on: a decent society with a strong economy. This government has got no capacity to deliver that—absolutely none. We don't even know who's going to be on the front bench. Even if we wanted to negotiate, who would we negotiate with?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Would we negotiate with Senator Cormann, with Malcolm Turnbull or with Peter Dutton? Nobody's got a clue what's going on. I think it speaks volumes that the majority in the Senate do understand that the Australian public don't want this to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For Senator Hinch to stand up here and say that all Labor is doing is giving a free kick to the banks is absolute nonsense. We have been consistent in our position. We don't want the $80 billion tax cuts. Senator Hinch has been on one side, then the other side, supporting, then not supporting, saying, 'I'll do $10 billion,' then, 'I'll do $50 billion,' and then, 'I'll do $500 billion.' Who knows where Senator Hinch is going to go? You would fit in with the Liberal Party really well, because you don't know what you're doing. You've completely lost the plot and you'd fit in there pretty well. I'm sure they'd even take you on, because they're so desperate. But it would be desperation, I think, to take you on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is not about personalities. This is about policies and the future of this country. The future of this country means that we have to set our priorities. Our priorities are health, education and infrastructure, and making sure we don't hand $80 billion to the big end of town and that we don't get conned. We would never be conned by the coalition, unlike some on the crossbench, who have been conned. Earlier in the piece, One Nation were going to back this because they were going to get 1,000 apprenticeships in regional Australia. We want apprenticeships in regional Australia, but you don't do it by doing a deal with the government to get an extra 1,000 apprenticeships, and then sell out health, education, infrastructure and the functioning of government. You don't do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the view that to be competitive we have to have the skills in place. We don't have the skills. We have the view that for people to actually engage in the country you need to be able to get a roof over your head. The problem we have here is that this government has cut $500 million out of support for Indigenous people around the country. They did that in 2014, under Senator Cormann. They have not renewed any support for Indigenous housing, except in the Northern Territory. It's crazy. Under Senator Cormann and this government, we've gone from the position of an austerity budget, which would have cut pensions by $80 a week over a decade. He ticked off on that. They would have made young people in this country who can't get a job survive for six months with no income. They came after family tax benefits. That austerity budget was an absolute disgrace, yet Senator Cormann thought it was so good. This economic theory, his political antenna, was that it was so good that you crack the champagne with the then Treasurer and you get out the Havana cigar and celebrate an austerity budget. We don't thing that's the right thing to do. Then the desperation kicked in—this has been a government of desperation from day one. When the desperation kicked in and they changed leader, with Malcolm Turnbull becoming the Prime Minister, we had increases to the GST. That was going to be the economic policy of the government. Then they were going to hand taxation rights to the states. I think both of them lasted about a week. Their last position was trickle-down economics—hand money to your mates at Goldman Sachs, hand money to the big banks and hand tax cuts to the private health funds, and everybody's going to be better off. It doesn't work. The theory's a bad theory, and it's only the ideologues and the extremists in the Liberal Party that think this can work. Look at what happened in the US. Look at what happened in Canada. It didn't deliver more wages. It didn't deliver more jobs. The analysis I've seen in Canada, where they gave tax cuts to the big end of town, was that actual employment increase was less in the companies that got the tax cuts at the big end than anywhere else in the country. So the theory has been disproved, not by another theory but by practical observation about what happens in the rest of the world.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cormann, to his credit, has been in here pushing his ideological obsession. He just pushes it and pushes it and argues for it—credit to him. But I just think it's the wrong thing to do, Labor think it's the wrong thing to do, the majority of this Senate think it's the wrong thing to do and now the majority of your own party think it's the wrong thing to do. You talk about wibble-wobble. Well, let me tell you: the wibble-wobble is so much that, if this government were a pushbike, you'd be on your side now with the wheels spinning. The wobble is so big that it is irrecoverable. This government is finished. This government has no economic credibility and no social credibility. You are disunited. You don't care about what's happening to working people in this country. You only care about your economic theories. You are an absolute disgrace.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hinch, you shouldn't be backing them in. You should be doing the same as I'm doing now: calling for an election so the public can make a decision on these issues. You should stop fiddling around with this government trying to get a fix for them. You should do the right thing by the Australian public and support what we're doing.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  I also want to get on record a quick response to Senator Cormann's statement and Senator Hinch's statement that somehow the Greens and Labor had supported tax cuts to the banks. I think there are many of us in this chamber that lament the state of politics in this country and how everything's dumbed down, with the emphasis on the word 'dumb'. But, for those who are following this debate, I made it very clear in my last statement that we oppose both these amendments because these amendments are designed to help enable the passage of the entire package of the bill. They're designed to split off a couple of crossbenchers on some kind of deal that's been done and give the government the numbers to pass the entire package of tax cuts to big corporations in this country</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> The Greens have been very clear: we oppose tax cuts to big corporations, including big multinationals. We oppose tax cuts that will be used, as the evidence in the US shows us, to buy back shares. And what do share buybacks do? They push up the price of shares, which is great for CEOs, because that means they get bigger bonuses, and their options are often in the money, and that means big packages and happy days. It's not so good for the workers. There's very little evidence that that money has been passed on to workers or that it's been used to hire more workers, which is this government's proposition on what tax cuts will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been very clear: we don't want to give more money to electricity companies that have been gouging customers in this country, or the big oil and gas companies that we've talked about in this place in recent days that aren't even paying tax, the Chevrons and ExxonMobils of the world who have got hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits clocked up through the petroleum resource rent tax, which is a complete rort. We don't want to be giving any big business in this country a tax cut when we desperately need revenue to pay for our social security, to pay for our safety net and to invest in our communities and our country's future. We believe that money should be going to investing in infrastructure and other ways of building the industries of the future—a real plan for a sustainable jobs and growth. We don't believe in hundreds of billions of dollars being wasted on defence industry rorts, pork-barrelling in marginal electorates for this government for the next election. We don't believe in turning Australia into a top 10 global arms dealer as a way of generating money. We have been very clear about what our propositions are for the Australian people for a future for all of us—a future for the whole country that actually looks after the planet and looks after communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to make it very clear today that this amendment that Senator Hinch has now put up is another amendment that is designed to get the deal done, designed to give the government the numbers. Fine, if Senator Hinch is happy to be giving tax cuts at a $500 million threshold. The Greens have been very clear that we are happy to give tax cuts to small business. We've led on that issue. We've supported it. It has been passed. Small business are the ones in this country that desperately need a hand. We don't believe that giving handouts to big business is the right thing to be doing. I think the Australian people agree with us. That's been very clear. I think we absolutely should be holding the government to account in this place, this house of review, which is the Senate. I think we should be taking these propositions to the next election and that's the message from the Australian Greens.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I thank the senator for his career advice—thank you, Senator Cameron. I will not be joining the Liberal Party. I have supported it on many occasions. I think I have supported the government in 62 per cent of the votes, and often that has happened with Labor Party amendments, which you have crafted and I've agreed with you to get it through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have voted with the government on the exclusion of the banks. It's not a position I have wibble-wobbled over or gone up and down and over and back over. For six months, Senator Cameron, I have held the position, having gone to $50 million turnover last year. I suggested back in March on Sky News that the government should go to $500 million and I would support them. The only change I've made is that I've said: 'If you want to give the tax cut to smaller companies a bit earlier, I'll go along with you on that. Apart from that, I will not.' The amendments put forward by Senator Cormann would exclude the banks and I believe in that. I was happy to vote with them. I will vote against the total bill. I will vote against total tax cuts and the government knows that. I've told them that. I've made no deals with them. I've made no side issues, no side bills, at all. I've told them how far I would go and that is to $500 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know my amendment will fail. I've done the best that I can. That is in the interests of the Australian people, because companies do need company tax cuts. In Britain, in the UK, in Canada, in Europe and in Singapore they have 17 or 19 per cent company tax. It's 20 per cent here and 21 per cent there. But I do agree with you, Senator Cameron, that much of the cuts in the United States under the Trump presidency, as I said yesterday, have gone to share buybacks, increased dividends and very high salaries for the executives. I agree with you on that. I will be voting against the bill. I recommend my amendment but I suspect—or know—it's going to lose.</span>

                    </a>  I am. The Senate has just voted against a motion that the bill stand as printed. Given that was somewhat unusual, although I think it has occurred before, it might be useful for the chair to advise the Senate what the status of the next vote signifies so senators can be clear what they're voting on and whether there will, in fact, be a third reading.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The CHAIR:</span>  Thank you, Senator Wong. The next part that we would vote on is that the bill be reported. We do need to report out of committee that the bill standing as printed has been rejected. That would then mean that, subsequently, there would be no third reading. So I'm going to put that. The question is that the bill be reported.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. This bill proposes to extend the cashless debit card trial to Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. If this bill is successful, all recipients of Newstart, youth allowance and parenting payment in the electorate of Hinkler who are under 36 will be forced to become trial participants. The cashless debit card quarantines 80 per cent of an income support payment onto a special debit card which cannot be used to purchase alcohol, to gamble or to buy gift cards which could in turn be used to purchase alcohol or gamble. It's expected that about 6,700 people in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay would become trial participants. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor do not support this bill. As we have said many times now, Labor support genuinely community-driven initiatives to tackle drug and alcohol abuse. We believe they must be genuinely community driven, not top down. Labor do not believe in a blanket approach to income management. We do not support a national rollout of the cashless debit card. We understand that the vast majority of income support recipients are more than capable of managing their own finances. We understand that, for many people, indeed most people, income management simply isn't necessary. We've said all along that we will talk to individual communities, and that we will make decisions on a location-by-location basis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence presented to the Senate inquiry and the feedback from the people in Bundaberg is very clear: the community in Bundaberg do not want to trial the cashless debit card in their town, full stop. The mayors in both the local government areas in the trial region, Bundaberg and the Fraser Coast shire, oppose the introduction of the cashless debit card in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. The mayor of Bundaberg, a former LNP stalwart and Queensland state minister, Jack Dempsey, says his community has turned against the cashless debit trial after learning of the cost. Key groups from Bundaberg said they felt ignored by government's consultation process on this issue. Representatives from the Gidarjil Development Corporation explained:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Gidarjil is probably considered the largest Indigenous organisation in Bundaberg, and there hasn't been any approach from the federal minister in regard to this or in fact anything.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Representatives from a community advocacy group in Bundaberg explained to a Senate inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… there has been little to no public consultation. What has taken place has been behind closed doors …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will consider the introduction of a new trial site only if the Liberals can show that they have an agreed formal consultation process, which includes an agreed definition of community consent, with the community. The Senate inquiry into this bill exposed the serious lack of meaningful consultation with local communities, and the anxiety of the residents who would become trial participants, about the impact that the trial would have on their budget and their ability to meet existing ongoing financial obligations. They also raised concerns about their access to lower-cost options for food, clothing and other essentials which are available only with cash. The third thing canvassed by the Senate inquiry was the lack of sufficient evidence to demonstrate that these trials effectively deliver positive outcomes for communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the most damning element in all of this—and it has been canvassed in other debates in this place in the last fortnight—is the lack of robust evidence. The government's own evaluation conducted by ORIMA into the effectiveness of the existing trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley is utterly inconclusive at best. The evaluation has been criticised by leading academics, and there is insufficient credible evidence at this point to support the establishment of further trials. Janet Hunt, the deputy director at the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research at ANU, said that the evaluation showed that the cashless debit card had not actually improved safety and reduced violence, despite that being one of the trial's key objectives. She's very critical of the methodology used by ORIMA to conduct the evaluation. She argues:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">People interviewed for the evaluation reported that they drank less than before the trial began. However, such recall over a year is not likely to be very reliable. And, because respondents had to give their ID to the interviewer, they may have said exactly what they thought the interviewer wanted to hear, and certainly would not have incriminated themselves …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is particularly true for Aboriginal people, who, for historical reasons, are likely to view authority figures with deep suspicion. Last year the former Minister for Human Services described the cashless debit card trials as a huge success. The Prime Minister himself asserted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's seen a massive reduction in alcohol abuse, in drug abuse, in domestic violence, in violence generally …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But Janet Hunt made it absolutely clear that this is not the case, and she said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Someone needs to tell them that the report does not say that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is hugely important. The government's argument for expanding the rollout of this card rests very heavily indeed on this evaluation, and when participants were asked about the impact of the trial on their children's lives only 17 per cent reported feeling that their children's lives were better as a result. The ORIMA evaluation was substandard. We don't believe that any government should be making significant policy decisions off the back of such a poor-quality evaluation. Labor will only consider the further expansion of cashless debit card trial sites when there is much greater evidence, and credible evidence, of the card's effectiveness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These same concerns were confirmed last month by the Auditor-General. His report indicated very real problems not just with the evaluation but with the rollout of the trial more generally, including the very high cost of the trials, budget overruns and flawed procurement processes. The report exposed not simply a flawed method of evaluation but also findings in that evaluation that were either unsubstantiated or false. For example, the government's evaluation said there was a decrease in ambulance callouts, but the ANAO found there had been an increase. The government's evaluation said there was an increase in school attendance, but the ANAO found Indigenous school attendance had decreased after the introduction of the card. The report also found that the trial ran over cost and that there were less-than-robust procurement processes. The ANAO has completely undermined and discredited the government's claim that there is evidence that this policy is working. I want to quote from the report. It says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… monitoring and evaluation was inadequate. As a consequence, it is difficult to conclude whether there had been a reduction in social harm and whether the card was a lower cost welfare quarantining approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What a joke! The entire point of having a trial is to generate an evidence base on the basis of which decisions can be made, yet this evaluation has been botched from the very beginning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to the cost, because the cost of the rollout of the cashless debit card is a further important consideration in the debate. What do we know? We know that the government has already paid $7.9 million of that to the debit card provider, Indue, and almost $1.6 million to ORIMA Research to provide a poor-quality evaluation. We understand that the current accrued cost of the cashless debit card trial is around $24 million for just two sites to 15 March this year. What it means, practically, is that the cost per head of the trial across the two sites is well over $10,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is extraordinary that we debate this legislation today without any indication from the minister about how much it will cost taxpayers to roll out the card at Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. Budget emergency? Not, apparently, when it comes to pursuing ideological preoccupations. In fact, the government still hasn't revealed how much the trial at the Goldfields is costing, despite the fact that the trial has been operating there since early May. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that a local council in Bundaberg did a survey that showed that, when locals were told how much the trial program would cost to administer, support for the trial in the community dropped to just 26 per cent. The government are deliberately avoiding telling us the cost per head for political reasons, and that is simply unacceptable. We are committed to dealing with the evidence, but you must present an evidence base, including the cost-effectiveness of the approach that you are recommending. The government needs to say how much the trial at Bundaberg and Hervey Bay will cost, and it needs to say what the cost of the existing trial is in the Goldfields in WA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee inquiry also heard a lot of evidence about the personal and negative impact that these trials would have on participants. Prospective participants talked about the importance of being able to make certain payments by direct debt and the fact that this card would not allow or accept direct debit. Some of them were concerned it would deprive them of a car, because car financing often requires a minimum direct debit payment. Participants were concerned about the ability to purchase fresh food and groceries, because it is often the case that roadside fruit and vegetable stalls only accept cash, and they are very cost-effective options for people in regional areas. DSS in their evidence explained that people would have to apply to the department for a regular transfer of cash to meet regular direct debit payments for approved items such as car repayments. Cash plays a vital role in the local economy. Restricting the access of people in this area to cash could jeopardise their ability to participate in that community. That's especially the case for low-income community members, who often use cash to access cheaper goods and services, including second-hand goods.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Residents in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay, as I have already mentioned, did not believe that adequate consultation had taken place. As far as we're aware, the local federal MP has failed to hold any kind of consultation, and when DSS did so community members said it was less of a consultation and more of a case of attendees being told that the debit card was coming, irrespective of their views. There's a key distinction between briefing people about what is about to happen to them and genuinely consulting and engaging people with their perception of problems and their perception of solutions that may work in response to problems. That is what community engagement means. It's not a series of PowerPoint slides flashed up with a bureaucrat standing out the front.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We supported the initiation of trials in Ceduna and East Kimberley. We support them continuing until to mid-2019 to allow more time to reliably determine whether they have been successful. It is predicated on community involvement. In April last year, the then shadow minister for social services, Jenny Macklin, and the then shadow minister for human services, Linda Burney, went to East Kimberley to meet with community leaders in Kununurra and Wyndham. The feedback they received in East Kimberley, if we're honest, was mixed. Some people were in favour of the card, others were very strongly opposed and many people thought the card was just worth trialling—willing to give it a shot. The common sentiment that Labor heard was that things are so bad in the local community that people are willing to give anything a go. Essentially they support the cashless debit card not out of hope but out of despair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We take a very clear-eyed view of this issue. We're not being ideological in our approach. We have a guiding set of principles founded on the notion of community consent and evidence, and that determines our position in this debate. We don't support the bill. We don't support the expansion of the card to Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. The evidence presented to the Senate inquiry as well as our own conversations show that people in the community of Bundaberg do not want to trial the cashless debit card in their town. Mayors of both local government areas in the trial region, Bundaberg and Fraser Coast, publicly oppose the introduction of the cashless debit card in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. The ORIMA evaluation into the effectiveness of the existing trials, which the government relies on heavily in their arguments, has been slammed by the Auditor-General as inconclusive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is unable to produce evidence of community consent and engagement. It is unable to produce robust evidence that the existing trials are working. In that context, further trials simply cannot be justified. Clear and credible evidence is needed before any decision can be made about the expansion of the current cashless debit card trial to any other areas. We will consider the introduction of a new trial site only if the government can show that they have an agreed formal consultation process with the community as well as an agreed definition of consent. We oppose the bill, and we encourage other senators to do the same.</span>

The Australian Greens oppose this bill. That should come as absolutely no surprise to anybody who has been taking an interest in income management in this country. We've opposed the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2012, the first two trials of this card, the third trial and now this. We will continue to reject income management as a punitive, top-down, controlling approach to the way we address social security in this country and the way we assume that people on income support can't manage their money and that they abuse the very low payments that they get.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will extend the cashless debit card to the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area, defined as the Division of Hinkler, on 31 May 2018, and it will continue until 30 June 2020. It will raise the participant cap across the trial sites from 10,000 to 15,000—in other words, it will cover the current three trials and this trial. It will also introduce an exemption to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 for merchants who decline transactions that use the funds in a welfare restricted bank account to purchase restricted products, including alcohol, gambling and cash-like products. Cash-like products are defined in the bill, and their inclusion as a restricted product will affect all trial sites. They are products like gift cards and things like that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens, as I said, have opposed the cashless debit card since its inception. We submitted a dissenting report on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Debit Card Trial) Bill 2015, expressing deep concerns regarding compulsory income management and recommending that the bill not be passed. We subsequently submitted a dissenting report on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017, highlighting the flaws of the so-called independent evaluation of the first two trial sites undertaken by ORIMA Research that was relied on to justify the expansion of the card to the Goldfields and the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay regions—and didn't the ANAO report put paid to the reliance on that flawed report! The 2017 bill did not pass the Senate in its original form, allowing only the Goldfields trial to commence, which is why we are here again debating whether or not to extend the trial to the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There was a lack of robustness in data collection and the department's evaluation did not make use of all available administrative data to measure the impact of the trial …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, and finally, the report found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the trial was not designed to test the scalability of the CDC and there was no plan in place to undertake further evaluation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll come back to that further evaluation issue. But the evidence isn't there to justify the expansion of this trial based on those evaluations. The Greens have said that all along. We've said right from the start that there isn't the evidence there to show that income management works—and that is clearly the case in relation to the Northern Territory intervention and the subsequent Stronger Futures legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, here, not only do you have the flawed information from the ORIMA report but you have the ANAO saying, 'it is difficult to conclude whether there has been a reduction in social harm and whether the card was a lower cost welfare quarantining approach'. There isn't the evidence to justify the expansion of this card. Of course, none of this information in the ANAO report was a surprise to me. The Australian Greens have been pointing out flaws in the evaluation reports since each was released—that is, the wave 1 and wave 2 ORIMA reports—and we've been questioning their reliability as a basis for continuing the trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley, and for the rolling out of trials in the additional locations. The Australian Greens want to see the government turn its focus to evidence-based policy, including community wraparound services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it's now known that there will be a further evaluation of the current trials, including of the Goldfields area, it beggars belief that there was consideration of not undertaking any further evaluation. I must say, that undermines the next evaluation right from the start, because it starts later—and late. Why would the government continue to call the scheme a trial if it wasn't going to measure the outcomes and inform itself of the results? It just illustrates the government's long-term intention to roll out the card far and wide, and penalise people on income support—who are struggling to find work, due to a lack of available jobs, and living in poverty, which is a barrier to trying to find work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compulsory income management, of which this card is one example, is a failed measure. Bear in mind, the Northern Territory intervention evaluation showed that income management met none of its objectives. How many times do I have to say this in this place? None. Yet the government still has an ideological commitment to this flawed, punitive approach. Income management is ineffective. It disempowers people. It stigmatises and humiliates people on the card, and those are the words of participants who are on the card. It causes social harm; it does not repair social harm. It harms those who need help the most. It also imposes significant costs on government—billions, over the years. It's time that it was abandoned as a policy mechanism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are particularly concerned that the government is attempting to roll out the card in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area when there is no evidence that the community is supportive of its introduction. I know the government will argue that there is support, but I have been there. I have held a public meeting and spoken to residents in this area. The committee inquiry was as short as a couple of hours and was not even held in the area. As the deputy chair of the legislation committee, I know that we didn't have the capacity to actually hold a proper, full inquiry into the bill in the time frame within which the government wanted to push this bill through. That's why it was restricted to a couple of hours and why it was not on site—which is what the local community would have wanted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's consultation with regard to this trial was tokenistic. They'll stand here and say, 'We did this, this and this.' But that was giving information, not asking people their opinion of the card. That's very different. The same thing happened in Kalgoorlie. They'll say there were hundreds there, but when you go and actually talk to the people who were going to be subjected to the card because they're on income management, those people will tell you that there were very few meetings they were invited to, I'm told by them, or that they knew about—which is very important. If you don't adequately tell people that you're going to be giving information on the program that you're going to be rolling out—if you don't tell people it's on—they can't very well turn up to participate. The government were providing information, which I'm sure is useful, but that doesn't mean they hear back from the people who are going to be on the card whether they think it's a good idea. Talk to the people who are going to be on the card. It hasn't been done in any of those sites, not prior to the rollout of the card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might add that, in Kalgoorlie, people were getting the card before they got the letter telling them they were going to be on the card. So much for consultation and working with the community to help this to be effective, and actually listening to them! The consultation was tokenistic and not representative of the people that will be placed on the card. The voices of those that will be affected are not being heard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 'Say No Cashless Welfare Debit Card Australia/No Cashless Debit Card Hinkler Region' submission to the inquiry into the bill said, among other things, that there was concern about the lack of public consultation from the local member and about the costs associated with the card—both monetary and social costs—for those who would be subject to the trial. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The stigma attached to the card through the constant demonising of the people on social security , the media 'welfare bashing' has already changed our local community language and the way people on social security are being treated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, they said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This card will further divide our community, excluding so many people in so many ways, from community events, school events, charity events, cash economy, secondhand economy, but also the banking economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They go on to say:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Just like the people on the card in the other regions, our residents do not deserve to be treated as a sub class citizen with their human rights removed, their freedoms removed, their ability to travel, decided for them …</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, they want to see the money that would be spent on the trial going to funding services such as homeless and domestic violence shelters, and to funding education pathways and creating jobs for local young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning now to our concerns about the bill, it will see those under 36 years of age who are receiving Newstart allowance, youth allowance (jobseeker) or parenting payment and whose usual place of residence is or was or becomes a place within the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area becoming subject to the cashless debit card. This is the first time the trial of a card will be limited to a particular age group. The Australian Greens are concerned that targeting a young cohort will further marginalise this group of people, who are already facing high unemployment in the area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also concerned that there is still no way in which individuals can transition off the card, now or into the future. Once they are on the card, they will remain on it, even if they leave the trial area. In relation to the trial applying to those whose usual place of residence was within the area, the Australian Human Rights Commission said in its submission to the bill's inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commission considers that this over-inclusive application of the cashless debit card trial is unnecessary and notes that the statement of compatibility with human rights does not provide a compelling justification for the proposed amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also provision for an optional community panel to be established. We are concerned about the inclusion of the community panel model for the proposed new trial area. This concern is exacerbated by the recent ANAO report that researched the community panels in the Ceduna and East Kimberley trial sites. The report indicates that the effectiveness of the community panels was reviewed by the department, which determined:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… that the Community Panels were not as effective as envisaged, resulting in lengthy delays in making decisions and that they would not be introduced into new localities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Later, the report said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Social Services did not refer to the evaluation of the trial, which noted other factors that impacted on the effectiveness of Community Panels, including the '…delay in establishing and commencing the Community Panels from the start of the trial' and that '…the panel process was not adequately known and communicated' to the trial participants and communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The community panel model raises issues regarding the privacy of participants and the potential for bias, conflicts of interest and discrimination, particularly in small communities, where neighbour may be judging neighbour. The lack of independent review of their decisions also raises concerns. The Australian Greens are concerned that the bill amends how the authorisation of community bodies will occur for the new site. Instead of authorisation being by legislative instrument it will be by way of notifiable instrument, which removes the ability for parliamentary scrutiny, which I have been using very strongly in this process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also concerned about safeguards. While the government may argue that there are safeguards in place to protect vulnerable individuals from the impacts of the card, due to the wellbeing exemption, the bill qualifies this exemption, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Secretary is not required to inquire into whether a person being a trial participant under this section would pose a serious risk to the person's mental, physical or emotional wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This means that, unless the secretary is informed of a participant's wellbeing by either the participant or another source, the participant will be forced onto the card—an ineffective mechanism. While this aligns with other trial sites, it is concerning to us that the burden of proof is placed onto the income support recipient. In addition, the ANAO report, in its assessment of the evaluation of KPIs, identified that the wellbeing exemptions, along with other administrative and operating aspects of the first two trial sites, were not measured with KPIs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to exempt the declining of a transaction from the provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, if it involves money from a welfare-restricted bank account and the purchase of alcohol, gambling or cash-like products that could be used to purchase alcohol or for gambling. This will affect all trial sites. Cash-like products are included in the definition of the bill as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) a gift card, store card, voucher or similar article (whether in a physical or electronic form);</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) a money order, postal order or similar order (whether in a physical or electronic form);</span>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />The National Social Security Rights Network said in its submission to the inquiry on the bill: 'This amendment will unnecessarily expand the gambit of the control exercised over the restricted portion of a cashless debit card.' Under this measure a person will be restricted from buying a gift or store card from a merchant that does not even sell any of the target prohibited items. This provision will further act to disempower cardholders and limit their economic and social participation in their communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ACOSS pointed out that this exclusion could lead to a situation where a participant would be unable to pay their bond or send money via post, for example, to their child at boarding school. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens also have concerns regarding the contingent amendment in the bill, item 20, which will come into effect if the applicable amendments in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017 have commenced, at the time these amendments commence. The contingent notice would uphold the deletion of the current section 124PM(b) of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, which allows participants to spend the unrestricted portion of their payment as they wish. It also expands the restrictions placed on the restricted portion of the payment to include cash-like products that could be used to obtain alcoholic beverages or gambling. The Australian Human Rights Commission said in relation to this amendment:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">... by removing the safeguard for persons to use the 'unrestricted' portion 'at their discretion' and by further restricting the uses to which the 'restricted' portion can be directed, both Bills are therefore detrimental to the economic freedom of trial participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In plain speaking, this means that of the 20 per cent cash—which is so important if you are on income support,  because you have to transact so much in cash; for example, buying secondhand goods—the government's bill says, 'We are going to use the 20 per cent that we said you could have in cash to pay your rent.' It doesn't come out of the 80 per cent; it comes out of the 20 per cent if you're in social housing. That means it has even more of an impact on people who are struggling to survive on income support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there is now in place a mechanism for the government to set aside perhaps nearly all of your income support. Why not put the rent—not that we support that bill—in the 80 per cent? I'll tell you why: because the government is ideologically driven to tell people on income support, who are some of the best money managers in the country, how to spend their money. This is a top-down, punitive approach that takes away people's agency. One of the most important things for people in maintaining their dignity is their ability to make those day-to-day life decisions around how they spend their money and how they look after their children. Now the government want to do this to people under the age of 36, who in some cases are still developing these skills. Now they are going to take all of their agency away. This is discriminatory. It's ideologically driven. It humiliates and stigmatises people. It should stop in this country. We are better than this. I'm glad the opposition are opposing this legislation, but I hope they have finally seen the light and will also help us to stop these appalling trials in the East Kimberley, the Goldfields and Ceduna. You can probably tell that we oppose this bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. We oppose income management, and we will continue to campaign against it. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:28</span>):  I rise to speak very briefly on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. I made a more extensive contribution just a couple of days ago, when the disallowance motions on regulations related to the cashless debit card trial were defeated. I want to make a few points in my contribution. One is that this is a different trial. It's a different trial site and it has a different set of assessment criteria. The persons living in the area will be under 36 years of age, receiving Newstart allowance, youth allowance, jobseeker payment and/or parenting payment single or parenting payment partnered. This is the cadre of people who would be transitioned onto the cashless debit card. This will involve about 6,700 people and will take a different approach to that taken in the current trial sites of Ceduna, East Kimberley and the Goldfields. What the government is trying to do with this new site is look at how the cashless debit card will work with a different cadre—a younger and more urbanised cadre—of people and also one which does not have as high a proportion of Indigenous participants as the existing trial sites. So it is a very different trial. It involves a very different cadre of people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just briefly on the consultation issue, I saw personally the level of consultation that occurred within the Goldfields region. There was extensive consultation. We've heard, through the Community Affairs Committee, of the consultation that has occurred in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. There were 188 meetings between May and September 2017. I'll quote from the minister:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These [meetings] canvassed views from a very broad range of stakeholders, including the community sector, service providers, community members, church groups, the business sector and all levels of government. These meetings demonstrated a clear need for support and intervention in the areas of youth unemployment, young families and intergenerational welfare dependency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll also quote from the Community Affairs Committee report, from Mr Steven Beer of IMPACT Community Services, one of the community service organisations working in the local area. He talked about what the consultation meetings were and the impact they had on people. This is one of the things he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Once they've got information about what the card is and is not, what it looks like, how it operates and works et cetera, whilst those younger people came into those sessions with some fairly negative points of view and some great questions, most of them left thinking that it was a fairly good thing to proceed with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I will raise the issue of the evaluation. The government has announced a second evaluation of the cashless debit card across all three current trial sites, and that would include the Hervey Bay and Bundaberg trial sites if this legislation is successfully passed. The second evaluation will use research methodologies developed independently by the University of Queensland and will draw on baseline measurements of social conditions in the Goldfields, developed by the University of Adelaide. Their findings of the second evaluation will be published in late 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've stated in this place before, nobody believes that the cashless debit card is a silver bullet. Nobody believes that the cashless debit card will work by itself. It needs to be supported by other measures. But the cashless debit card is a way of trying to break some of the negative behaviour, trying to stop a cycle of addiction, dependency and lack of control over peoples' funding. And, yes, whilst it is anecdotal, there have been very significant reports of positive outcomes in the current trial sites. The evaluation is important and necessary, and the evaluation is something that will be legislated if and when, hopefully, we pass this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  I'm only going to make a short contribution to join with my Labor colleagues in opposing the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. I participated in inquiries concerning the terms of this bill. From Labor's perspective, we continue to have concerns with the rollout of the cashless welfare card. We're aware that it is up and running in a couple of sites; I'm thinking in particular of Western Australia. There are ongoing concerns about the rollout of the cashless welfare card in those sites, but we accept that community support has been demonstrated in a couple of sites, and on that basis we have been prepared to support the trials going ahead in those locations. The same cannot be said of the proposed trial that is envisaged by this bill to roll out the cashless welfare card in the Hinkler region, around Bundaberg and Hervey Bay in Queensland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I participated in the Senate inquiry into this bill. It is fair to say that the views of the community are mixed in relation to this proposal. From a Labor perspective, we don't think that it is wise to proceed with this trial in an area where community opinion is split and, in fact, where there is substantial opposition to it going ahead. I recognise that there are some people within the community in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay and the surrounding region who want this to go ahead—in particular, the federal member, Mr Pitt. But I don't think that he or the department have adequately consulted with the local community to a point that they can demonstrate there is community support for this going ahead. We think the only way in which such a radical measure can possibly work is if it is done with widespread community support. That has been demonstrated in a couple of sites where the trial is up and running, although there do remain problems, in our view, about the rollout. But it cannot be demonstrated to our satisfaction that there is the level of community support in the Hinkler region for this measure to justify it going ahead. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other concern that Labor has with this trial in general is the very poor evaluations that have been conducted to date. The government have, in the past, pointed to evaluations that have been commissioned by the department which they say demonstrate that the trial is working and, again, that it has community support. I won't go into it in a whole lot of detail, but those who are interested can refer to the Senate inquiry and Labor members' reports on this cashless welfare card. But we have very significant concerns about the quality of those evaluations and their reliability. In short, we don't think that this measure is working anywhere nearly as successfully as what the government claims and, again, we think that for it to proceed it needs a lot more community support than has been demonstrated, particularly in the Hinkler region. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I might say is that, if you believe the government's arguments, the reason that this is needed is to, as they put it, break the cycle of welfare dependency. There is no doubt that the region of Hinkler, which covers Bundaberg, Hervey Bay and surrounding towns, has extremely high unemployment and extremely high youth unemployment, and that is not a new thing. That is something that the area has suffered through for decades—I might say, decades when it has been represented by members of the National Party. I think that it would be very wise for the government, before it imposes radical measures like this, to actually put a bit more effort into job-creation projects in the Hinkler region to try to overcome the level of unemployment that has been there for many decades now. We do not see the level of investment from this government in the type of infrastructure that creates jobs in the actual construction of that infrastructure and obviously improves economic efficiency in the region. They should be investing more in infrastructure, but they also should be doing more to work with the local community and local industry to identify genuine industry opportunities and employment opportunities that can be built in that region. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Too often from this government we see a very hands-off, laissez-faire attitude towards the running of the economy. They're happy to sit by while particular regions in our country languish with extremely high levels of unemployment. That is certainly the case in the Hinkler region, and I know it's a problem in many other parts of Australia as well. But I think that to only undertake quite punitive measures, similar to those that are proposed in this bill, without putting any genuine effort into creating jobs for people and helping them into work really isn't tackling the problem in the right way. For those reasons, I'll be joining with the opposition to oppose this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  I would like to make it clear at the outset that Centre Alliance will not be supporting this bill. As we stated in February when the Senate passed the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2017, we were happy to allow the government to roll out trials in the three sites as it originally planned. We also supported an extension of the trials until June next year to allow more time for evaluation, but we said then that we would not entertain any further extensions until we had seen robust results of the trial. This bill prematurely attempts to add in a fourth trial site before we have all the data to properly assess whether the existing trials have achieved their harm-minimisation aims. That's partly because the trials are still underway and partly because the initial evaluation process was very much flawed. We accept that the government has now changed the evaluation process to utilise all available data sources and collect baseline data from Goldfields participants; however, this does not change the fact that we were quite clear about our limits in February this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to prove that quarantining 80 per cent of participants' income support can make a positive difference for participants and their communities before it is rolled out to more people than the 10,000 already permitted. We're also concerned that the government's reasons for implementing the trial seem to keep shifting. In the initial trials the aim was to reduce harm and violence from alcohol, gambling and illicit drugs and to 'encourage socially responsible behaviour'. Now the argument has morphed into an attack on intergenerational welfare dependency. In his media release, the Minister for Social Services, Dan Tehan, said that this fourth trial in the Hinkler electorate would 'help break the cycle of welfare dependency'. Unlike in the other trial sites, which apply the card to everyone of working age on income support, in this electorate the bill seeks to limit the cashless debit card to people aged under 36 who are on Newstart, youth allowance or parenting payment. It will target young unemployed people and young families. The minister said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Intergenerational welfare dependence is ruining families, there are some young people who have never seen their parents, and even their grandparents, hold down a job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree that we need to help young unemployed people get into suitable employment. But in areas where jobs are scarce, income management isn't going to suddenly get people trained and right up and into work. I'm sure the member for Hinkler in the other place is sincere about the challenges in his community. But using the cashless debit card to tackle the particular social ills of the regions seems to me to be very much a blunt instrument. It will not make negligent parents into better parents. It will not train the unemployed for work. It will not tackle disadvantage or improve social skills. It imposes a burden on families who may have no substance abuse or gambling problems whatsoever. In short, I can't see how it will address intergenerational welfare dependency as the minister seems to hope it will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The unemployment rate in the electorate is high. In the Bundaberg council area it was around nine per cent in the March quarter. It is stubbornly stuck around that level and is significantly higher than the unemployment rate for regional Queensland, at six per cent, and compares with a national rate of 5.5 per cent. In the neighbouring council area covering Hervey Bay the unemployment rate was even higher, at more than 10 per cent, for the March quarter. So, it is clear that the Hinkler electorate needs much more than the cashless debit card to get its young people off welfare and into work. It needs more jobs, first and foremost. If the government is going to impose this card on more people, particularly on young families, it should do it with conclusive, consistent data to demonstrate its case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his second reading speech the minister referred to the findings of the August 2017 final evaluation report on the initial trial in the Ceduna and East Kimberley region to make his case for the current trial. However, we now know that those findings were very much flawed. I said in my speech in February that Centre Alliance had concerns about the quality of the outcome data for the trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley. This has been borne out by the Auditor-General's recent report, <span style="font-style:italic;">The implementation and performance of the cashless debit card trial</span>. The National Audit Office found that key monitoring activities:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… were not undertaken or fully effective, and the level of unrestricted cash available in the community was not effectively monitored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Audit Office also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There was a lack of robustness in data collection and the department's evaluation did not make use of all available administrative data to measure the impact of the trial including any change in social harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These flaws will hopefully be addressed going forward, but, as I said at the beginning of my speech, we will wait to see the outcomes of the evaluations due next year before we're prepared to consider any further extensions of this trial.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  I hold serious concerns about this proposed legislation. The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018 seeks to extend the cashless debit card to an area in Queensland that includes Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. It would also make changes that affect the cashless debit card scheme as a whole, including provisions to ensure that merchants are able to decline cashless debit card transactions where the cardholder tries to use the card for gambling, alcohol or gift cards and other cash-like products. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me remind you of the significant impacts of the existing CDC trial on many Australians. It works by quarantining 80 per cent of a recipient's welfare payments on a special debit card that cannot be used on alcohol or gambling, or to withdraw cash. This leaves only 20 per cent of benefits able to be used as cash. Participation is mandatory for all working-age payment recipients who live in the selected trial sites. Make no mistake: this card has a deeply profound impact on peoples' lives. Because of this, it must be rolled out using evidence meeting the most rigorous standards, and it should only be expanded beyond existing sites if the evidence shows that there have been some real and tangible social benefits to those who are forced to use it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been told by Minister Dan Tehan that the implementation of the trial in the existing trial sites, Ceduna and the East Kimberley, has been a raging success, but he has scant evidence upon which to base this. An independent audit by the Australian National Audit Office, published on 17 July this year, shows it has some serious concerns. We were assured in this parliament, when the cashless debit card trial commenced, that there were plans for the most rigorous analysis, monitoring and evaluation of the cashless debit card trial, but the ANAO says that this simply has not happened. Those plans, including a cost-benefit analysis and post-implementation review, never eventuated. The department also failed to properly measure baseline data, making it difficult to know what impact the trial has had. The conclusion to the ANAO report stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">the Department of Social Services'—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">approach to monitoring and evaluation was inadequate. As a consequence, it is difficult to conclude whether there had been a reduction in social harm and whether the card was a lower cost welfare quarantining approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's extraordinary that the coalition government would now seek to extend this trial to a new site when the ANAO has been unable to conclude whether there has been a reduction in social harm in the existing sites. Have a think about that: this program is costing in the millions to run in these trial sites, and we cannot even evaluate whether it's working. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the ANAO report, the recently completed Senate inquiry raised more questions about the existing trial sites than it answered. It was made clear during the course of that inquiry that there had been insufficient consultation with the community of Bundaberg about the proposed expansion of the cashless debit card there. Leanne Donaldson, the then member for Bundaberg, told the committee that the consultation process has been selective and secretive. Representatives from the Gidarjil Development Corporation explained that Gidarjil is probably considered the largest Indigenous organisation in Bundaberg and that there hasn't been any approach from the federal minister with regard to this—or, in fact, anything. All of this is really concerning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the Senate inquiry revealed mixed evidence about the effectiveness of the trials. The inquiry heard evidence that the evaluations undertaken by the company ORIMA Research of the trial in the East Kimberley and in Ceduna were unreliable, and that no empirical judgements about the effectiveness of the trials can be made on the basis of the information collected. Dr Janet Hunt of the Australian National University expressed significant and serious concerns about the reliability of the ORIMA evaluations. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My assessment, based on my extensive experience as a social scientist, is that the evaluation reports do not present adequate evidence of the trial leading to successful outcomes for participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This view by this eminent academic is shared by the ANAO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note evidence to the inquiry that the cashless debit card is not effective alone in solving the social issues in the trial communities. What is needed is support and funding for existing and new services in those communities to help those in need. Ms Zell Dodd, the CEO of the Ceduna Koonibba Aboriginal Health Service Aboriginal Corporation, explained during the inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… regarding alcohol and other drug support services, which were funded as part of a cashless debit card trial in the Far West Coast region. It is not about the cashless debit card itself; it is about the support services and its consequences, such as little or no investment in social and emotional wellbeing services as part of the trial. Rather than reducing the need for alcohol and other drug support services, the view is that the trial is likely to increase the demand for alcohol and other drug services as well as social and emotional wellbeing services and, in fact, mental health services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is needed from government is a commitment on the delivery of wraparound services before any trials are extended. It is totally inappropriate to extend the cashless debit card to a new location when there are serious doubts about the benefits of the trial in the existing sites. The trials in East Kimberley and in Ceduna have not been going on long enough to properly ascertain whether they have been effective. There is mixed evidence about the effectiveness of the trials to date, and a far more rigorous evaluation of the trials should be carried out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to note the cost of implementing the cashless debit card. For the first 12 months of the cashless debit card trial in Ceduna and Kununurra, the estimated maximum cost of the trial was $18.9 million, approximately $10,000 per person. Have a think about that. It cost $18.9 million for a trial that hasn't been adequately evaluated and whose reports haven't been done. The department has failed and the minister is failing to adequately find out what is going on in these communities. $18.9 million—seriously? And we want to roll this out to another community? The cost of the scheme for the Goldfields has not been publicly released. There has been no independently verified costing released for the proposed new trial sites in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region in Queensland, so we are being asked to vote on the expansion of the trial in the complete absence of financial costings for that trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are no costings of what this could be and what it could mean, yet we only have to look at what's going on already in WA and at the $18.9 million that is being spent in WA and South Australia. It is expected that around 6,700 people in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay would become trial participants. So if we base it on a similar number, the $10,000 per person in WA and South Australia, and say it's maybe 6,700 times $10,000 per person, that might give us a fair idea. But they're not the official costings from that site. Those opposite haven't given us anything. As of March 2018, in Hinkler there were 8,108 Newstart recipients, 764 parenting payment (partnered) recipients, 2,518 parenting payment (single) recipients and 1,501 youth allowance (other) recipients. I hold serious concerns about the large numbers of single parents who will be subjected to this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As with my previous speech on the expansion of the card, I do draw reference to Calla Wahlquist's piece in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> in which she detailed the harrowing experience of a domestic violence survivor. The victim, who was from Ceduna, expressed the view that the cashless welfare card would have stopped her from being able to escape a violent and oppressive marriage. It is a story we heard too often in the Senate committee inquiry as we travelled listening to evidence in relation to this card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Prime Minister has raised the question of possibly expanding the trials to remote communities in the Northern Territory. Well, hold up there, Prime Minister! Let me say stop to that. We've got some questions to ask. Many Indigenous welfare recipients in the Northern Territory, particularly those in regional and remote communities, are already subjected to income management systems through the BasicsCard, and I fear that the implementation of further welfare management systems will only further restrict their autonomy and individuality. There are issues with income management more broadly in its failure to meet some of its purported objectives. Again, the Australian National University's research paper released in 2016 highlighted the mixed, if not outright detrimental, effects of new income management in the Northern Territory. While the BasicsCard model applies across the board, in reality it is Indigenous Territorians who represent 91 per cent of people under the regime. Really? This counts for everyone? Yeah right!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Intergenerational poverty remains evident. What is the scenario if further compulsory income management is extended to a selected community like Tennant Creek, where the BasicsCard is already in force and where they are subjected to further deeply flawed programs, such as the Community Development Program? This approach to income management and the implementation of the cashless card on the presumption that it will reduce some of the negative aspects of life in regional and remote communities fails to consider more prevalent barriers to meaningful employment, consideration of which would ultimately dismiss the need for such policies in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the inquiry by the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee into the government's disastrous Community Development Program, Labor examined the true foundations for why people in regional and remote communities struggle to gain and maintain employment. As part of the report that followed the inquiry, the committee made reference to several papers which highlighted barriers to employment for people in regional and remote communities. In a 2010 paper, McRae-Williams and Gerritsen explained the unique economic and employment challenges within remote communities. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are limited employment opportunities with a significant gap between the size of the labour force and the number of jobs generated in the local economy as well as inadequate physical infrastructure for many economic development proposals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, a 2014 study by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare found that Indigenous Australians generally experience multiple barriers to economic participation, including lower levels of education; poorer health; and more difficulties with English, which in many cases, particularly in the Northern Territory, is not the first language of First Nations people. Other barriers include high rates of incarceration, inadequate housing and accommodation and lack of access to social networks that may help to facilitate employment, as well as practical challenges, such as needing to travel to buy groceries and attend medical appointments. Have a think about travelling to get groceries, buy fruit and vegies and attend medical services. Appointments are either too expensive or simply not available and are often not accommodated as part of CDP, let alone the implementation of the cashless welfare card. These are the challenges that communities in our regions across Australia face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many people who are advocating for the cashless debit card, in particular around Tennant Creek, but what information has the community been given about the implementation of the card, the lack of evaluation of it, and the lack of any evidence to show results in those towns where it already exists? What information? How tied is the card to the much-talked-about but, again, short-on-detail regional deal proposed for Tennant Creek—proposed by, perhaps, the Prime Minister on his recent visit. If people in Tennant Creek want a cashless debit card, then they have a right to advocate for that, but they need to be fully informed of what the card involves, including the restrictions and some flow-on consequences that we have seen in other towns. Similarly, people in Hinkler need to be fully informed about the potential impacts of the cashless debit card, and this government just is not in a position to do that. I have heard from people in the East Kimberley who have said, 'It didn't do what I thought it was going to do, and I don't believe it has had the effect that I thought it would.' They've also gone on to say: 'I feel powerless right now. I'm seeing that there is more drinking. There's a lot of sly grogging. I'm seeing a lot of kids late at night when I go to the shopping centre.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the committee process of examining this bill, it became very clear that there had been insufficient consultation with the very communities subjected to the expansion and very little consultation with the very people you want this to be imposed on. Witnesses at the Kalgoorlie hearing, in particular, expressed serious dissatisfaction with the consultation process that was undertaken prior to the announcement of the Goldfields trial site, describing that process as very lacklustre. I have real concerns that the cashless debit card isn't reaching the end goal in addressing poverty and disadvantage. If anything, people are feeling that they are staying exactly in that place of poverty and disadvantage. As the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation stated in its submission to the inquiry around the expansion of the CDC:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We also note that Aboriginal people are disproportionately affected by the trials and that they are in and proposed for locations where the majority participants are Aboriginal. Whilst it is not the stated intent of the trials, its impact is discriminatory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation is saying, in effect, that it's discriminatory. When we see that a large proportion of those on the card are First Nations people, can we really say that we are trying to improve the lives of First Nations people? Can we really say in this parliament that we are about enabling people to rise above poverty and disadvantage and enabling people to take their place in this country with full rights and full access to the services that they require?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is intent on pushing and punishing welfare recipients. That's what it looks like. That's what it feels like for people—ignoring your own evidence or lack thereof. Seriously, $18 million on a trial that you have not been able to evaluate in the true sense of the word! There is a huge irresponsibility in all of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports community-driven initiatives to tackle drug and alcohol abuse. Labor does not believe in a blanket approach to income management. We will not support the extension of the cashless debit card in Bundaberg, Hervey Bay or any further trial sites unless the government establishes a formal framework for consultation, including establishing community consent for a trial and a sufficient evidence base demonstrating the success of the trials. The bill should be opposed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="DT6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BARTLETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:05</span>):  The proposed legislation before us, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018, is fairly unusual in the sense that it solely affects people just in one electorate or one part of my home state of Queensland—parts of the electorate of Hinkler and, most significantly, the communities in and around the towns of Hervey Bay and Bundaberg. That being the case, I want to put on the record again how deeply disappointed and, frankly, disgusted I am that the government-controlled Senate committee did not take the time to go to the communities directly affected by this legislation. It simply held a derisory phone hearing, packing in a small number of witnesses, all within a brief half-hour period. I'm sure each of us in this place knows those types of so-called hearings. The nature of the consultation was token in the extreme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this issue of the cashless debit card trial is not new. There was legislation relating to this at the start of this year and a Senate committee inquiry into the wider idea of the trials at the end of last year. But, again, the committee did not go to Queensland. They did go and hold a hearing in Kalgoorlie, in an area that was going to be affected by the legislation, but they did not come to Queensland. The Senate quite rightly rejected the attempt at that time to expand the trials to parts of Queensland, and I very much urge the Senate to do the same again now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing has changed since then. The only thing, really, that has changed is that there is even more information about how badly designed the trial is. There is the very damning Auditor-General report into the trial to date, which I spoke to in this chamber last week, as well as the clear condemnation of the farcical assessment that was released by the government to try to justify the so-called effectiveness of the trials that have occurred to date. Other speakers on this legislation have already gone through the very strong and very valid criticisms of that so-called assessment, a classic case of an assessment designed to deliver what the government wanted to hear based on flimsy or flawed underpinnings. It delivers what I think, frankly, is a false picture of the reality of the impact of the trials where they're already happening. So, if anything, the Senate's got far more reason now to reject this attempt to expand the trial of the cashless debit card than it did when it rejected that aspect of the legislation earlier this year. I repeat my plea to fellow crossbenchers to consider this issue very carefully and to vote against it. It is clear that the numbers on this legislation are very tight, so I urge senators, particularly Senator Storer and Senator Leyonhjelm, to please consider voting against this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been to Hervey Bay and spoken with many people there. I went there last year, before I was back in this place, with my colleague Senator Siewert, and again just a few weeks ago. I also went to a public meeting in Bundaberg on a Monday night, attended by over 50 people, and not just people who are going to be directly affected by this trial. In an effort to get the Senate to agree to this trial, the government has wound it back and reduced the number of people it would apply to—only people under 35 who are on Newstart and parenting payments, including sole parents. That shouldn't matter. There's no logic as to why it should do that. The only so-called logic is political logic: an attempt to try to make it more politically saleable, to reinforce the disgraceful, longstanding myth that people on unemployment and social security payments and sole parents somehow or other are bludgers and unable to manage their money. That should not be a reason to now vote to extend the trial; it should be another reason to vote against it. People receiving Newstart payments are amongst the best money managers in the country. They have to be, because their payments are so low.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is handing money over to a private financial company, rather than spending it on assisting people in Hervey Bay and Bundaberg, particularly young people, to get jobs or on creating economic activity in those regions. The youth unemployment rate in those areas is significantly above the national and state averages. That's a reason to put more resources into stimulating the economy there with training; it's not a reason to waste money so that a financial corporation can make life even tougher for people receiving those social security payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even just as a matter of principle—that a Senate committee refused to go and listen directly to the community the government wants to impose this on—I'd urge Senator Storer and Senator Leyonhjelm to oppose this legislation. The mayor of Bundaberg, a former LNP state MP, has said on the record that he opposes this measure coming into his community, because the money would be better invested on services and job-generating activity. People can benefit from assistance to address substance abuse or gambling problems and any consequential financial challenges, but that should be personalised for those who need it, not a massive straitjacket imposed upon every single person solely on the criteria that they receive certain social security payments or are of a certain age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no rationale whatsoever for discriminating in that way, other than the supposed political benefits of further demonising the unemployed and those people who receive social security payments. That is something this government specialises in. They don't have terribly many ideas, but the ones they do have usually involve demonising some of the least powerful, poorest parts of the community. They're very good at demonising and dividing. Make no mistake: this is another measure to do that. All you need to do is look at the public debates and some of the online commentary around the card, and you will see what is motivating it. That type of commentary appears whenever this issue is brought up. It's all about reinforcing the myths and stereotypes of people on social security payments as, somehow, bludgers—when, in so many cases, they are people who merit more support and assistance, rather than things that make their life harder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned the mayor of Bundaberg before; I also mention the mayor of Hervey Bay, Councillor George Seymour. He was deputy mayor when I went to Hervey Bay last year; he's mayor now. He has spoken out quite eloquently against this card, not only the fact that it won't work for those people it's supposedly meant to assist but also the fact that it would be harmful to his community more broadly. I think, initially, Hervey Bay was seen as a place people went when they retired, but it's changed enormously in recent times. It's grown quite significantly as a community. Its local economy is very much driven now by tourism, by attracting people to the area because of its magnificent natural environment as well as its general attractiveness as a location. The last thing it needs is singling out as a community that has some sort of specific, unique social problem that merits this sort of measure, because it simply doesn't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As many people who work in this field—with people on social security payments, and with younger people who need assistance because of substance abuse issues—have said: if anything, this is likely to increase related crime. Further restricting people's control over their own income is hardly going to assist them to better manage their situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will impact on some of those small businesses that rely more significantly on the cash-based economy. There is no doubt about that. That is self-evident. The last thing we need is another measure that will somehow or other make it harder for small businesses but easier for the bigger companies and bigger retailers. We need to be encouraging diversity in the local economy, not further restricting the way that it operates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned the public meeting I went to in Bundaberg. Many of the people there were not people who are going to be affected by the measure directly. In fact, the majority of them weren't. There were many there who are social security recipients; though they won't be subject to this trial because of their age, or because they're on disability or carer payments—at least at this stage, they aren't subject to this measure. But they know that measures like this reinforce the discrimination that they already face as people on social security payments, so they will still cop the public abuse. They will still cop the increased public cynicism that comes when these myths are reinforced by political leaders. And, of course, they know that the more this is rolled out, the more chance there is that it will become entrenched, and that it will become a measure that is slowly wound out to more and more of them and will eventually, potentially, catch them in its net.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the other people at these meetings that I went to, in both Hervey Bay and Bundaberg, were people who worked in schools—for example, guidance officers. The supposed benefit of this card would be that it would help parents on Newstart or parenting payments to manage their money and, therefore, better able to have money available to feed their kids—those sorts of ideas. As I said, people on social security payments are amongst the best money managers in the country because they have to be. If there are challenges for people to get by, those challenges are magnified because of the inadequacy of the payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of those people at those meetings were from other local, not-for-profit organisations and support services that work in areas with low-income people. I mentioned that the mayor, George Seymour, had a background in youth work and working with people in the community around social issues. All of those who were there not only said this measure wouldn't work but that it would make things worse for the majority of people. There'll be a group of people who will be fine: they'll adapt, they'll work with it and all of that. It will just be another piece of unnecessary bureaucracy and a waste of government money for no great purpose. But there will be a group of people for whom this will make it harder—it will make it more challenging for them to get by. Part of how people do get by when they're on very low incomes is through the cash-based economy. It is through finding bargains at op shops and markets, or paying friends to do maintenance, and those sorts of things. This will make it more difficult for them to make those dollars stretch out as far as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government want to assist people with managing their finances, and want to put money into this, how about they fund not-for-profit financial counselling better?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a visit yesterday from people from the financial counselling field, who pointed to the significant problems faced by people who need to manage their debt. I'm sure any of us here who had to get by on just the amount of Newstart would find it extremely hard not to end up in significant debt and having to juggle that. Household debt for people of all incomes is at record levels in Australia, and more and more people are becoming vulnerable to for-profit debt management firms that prey on people who have low incomes. I'm not talking about just payday lenders and the like; I'm talking about professional debt management firms, who advertise. I'm sure we've all seen the advertisements. They actually charge people and further exploit them, and there's no regulation around that industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government want to help, how about they better regulate the for-profit debt management organisations to ensure they don't exploit people in the way many of them do? How about they use the money that is being used on this card to properly fund financial counselling more generally—not-for-profit financial counselling? The federal government currently spends about $20 million to fund financial counselling services, and the states spend an estimated $26 million. There's certainly a significant and growing need there. More funding would go a long way in assisting people who do have genuine issues with managing their money and in protecting them from being exploited. We could put a levy on the industry to fund financial counselling, as happens in the UK and as already happens here regarding an industry levy to fund ASIC, for example. Those are the sorts of measures this government could use if it actually wanted to assist people who are having challenges with managing their income, rather than just putting a punishing straightjacket around an entire group of people and a using a measure that reinforces the stereotypes, the false prejudices and the myths around people who are unemployed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know—and we've talked about this in different contexts in this place in recent weeks—how much responsibility we have as public leaders in the language we use, in making sure that we do not further divide the community, that we do not demonise and single out parts of the community. This is another group of people who are deliberately demonised and have been for a long, long time. Because of those debates we have acknowledged that it is damaging and harmful to people both as individuals and as a group—to our community and the general social fabric—when false myths and stereotypes are reinforced and peddled, or even if they're allowed to flourish without being countered. But that is what is going on here. That is why the government, even though they got part of their measures through at the start of this year, rolled this one out again straightaway, had a sham Senate committee inquiry and didn't bother going to the communities that they are actually going to target with this and are trying to push this up again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a speciality of this government, whether in this type of area, in regard to social security recipients, or whether in other sections of the community, to demonise, single out and create division. That is the overarching goal of this measure. All the independent evidence and the experts in the field say it won't work, it won't deliver the supposed benefits that the government said is their motivation. So many of the people in the communities that are directly affected say they don't want it and that it will be harmful to their community in general, let alone to the individuals there. It's expenditure of public money that would be far better spent to create benefits on the ground in those communities, whether that be direct economic stimulation and employment or funding for some of the social services that work directly on the issues that the government says it's trying to address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also, of course, a massive Big Brother measure. I would appeal to Senator Leyonhjelm—perhaps on those grounds, given his general dislike of red tape and regulation—that he not support the government in spending money to enforce more regulation and red tape, particularly in a discriminatory way against a particular part of the community in a particular part of the country. I again repeat my appeal to him and to Senator Storer to please vote against this legislation. Their votes will be the critical ones with regard to a piece of legislation where the government has made no effort to consult with the community and has made no effort, frankly, to work constructively on so many issues. There is Senator Leyonhjelm's experience of the government breaking the commitments that it had given him. This is a chance to demonstrate his unhappiness about that as well. There are many, many reasons to vote against this legislation, but perhaps the simplest one is that it won't work. Why waste more money on something that isn't going to work?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:25</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. I have spoken before, in earlier debates on the cashless debit card, of my support for quarantining cash payments made to welfare recipients. I have done so after meeting with and listening to members of the communities where trials have been in place. I took part in the Kalgoorlie hearing of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee and listened to the views of those directly and indirectly impacted by the scheme. I heard and evaluated the arguments both for and against. As a result, I voted in favour of the extension of the scheme to the Goldfields region of Western Australia and remain in favour of the cashless debit card. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The argument against the card is that quarantining welfare payments so that only 20 per cent is paid in cash is a human rights issue. I fail to see how ensuring that 80 per cent of a welfare support payment can't be spent on alcohol or drugs in any way impacts on an individual's human rights. The amount of payment they receive is not reduced; it is simply paid in a different way. Limiting the amount of money which can be spent on alcohol and be available to access illicit drugs means that there is more money for essential everyday items. Foremost, there is more money for adequate, decent food for the family. I have been told that the effect of the change in the Western Australian Goldfields is very noticeable. Parents are seen shopping at supermarkets for food for their children instead of hanging around, waiting for the pub to open. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed expansion of the scheme to introduce a new trial to the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay regions of my state is intended for a different purpose. It will apply only to persons aged 35 or less who receive Newstart allowance or youth allowance, apart from those who are new apprentices or full-time students or are on parenting payment. In doing so, it aims to address the high level of youth unemployment in the area, and especially the high level of intergenerational welfare dependency. It will not affect anyone who receives a disability payment and it will not apply to pensioners. There will be other exemptions, including young people who are on a new apprenticeship or are full-time students. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This area also has a high level of alcohol consumption and drug dependency among young people. In other words, the proposed trial will target the specific dual problems of youth unemployment and substance abuse in the region as a way of breaking intergenerational welfare dependency. Drug dealers depend on the cash economy. If we can reduce the amount of cash flowing in a community, it has to hurt the drug trade and reduce the high level of drugs which are available. Lessening dependence on alcohol and drugs will provide an opportunity for young people with drug or alcohol problems to address these problems and hopefully get on top of them. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This country provides wonderful opportunities for young people who are prepared to work and contribute to their community to prosper. It is of great concern to me that so many of our youth and young people in the Bundaberg-Hervey Bay region are on welfare—either on youth allowance or on Newstart, or in receipt of parenting payments. It is appalling that this area of Queensland has the highest rate of intergenerational welfare dependency in the country. Something has to be done to address this for the benefit of the young welfare recipients themselves and the future of the region. Let's give them a chance by making welfare less appealing and encouraging them to get a job and become contributing members of their communities. The Bundaberg-Hervey Bay trial is intended to continue until 30 June 2020 to allow time to evaluate the scheme and decide whether it should be rolled out to other areas. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having just listened to Senator Bartlett's comments, I just see it as bleeding heart, and so do a lot of other Australians. At the end of the day, this money is taxpayers' money. It is taxpayers who actually have to go and work, and abide by rules and regulations, either with the company they're working for or by guidelines under government policies, to earn their money. Out of their hard-earned money, they pay their taxes, and, because they do that, we're able to have these Newstart and youth allowance payments made to people who are not working. I think the taxpayer would dearly love to see that their hard-earned dollars are spent wisely and not just wasted. People on these welfare payments do have an obligation to the taxpayer. This is saying to these people: 'Okay, you're going to get 80 per cent of your cash payments put into an account and you can only use that money to pay for rent or food. You can buy things with it—there are shops that will say, "Yes, you can go and buy that." But they're putting restrictions on it. You're not going to be able to have the cash in your pocket to go and pay the drug dealers, you're not going to have the money in your pocket to go and play the poker machines and you're not going to have the money in your pocket to go and buy alcohol or even cigarettes.' What is wrong with that? Everyone wants their rights, but with rights come responsibilities, and the responsibilities here are about taxpayers' dollars. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bartlett says that this will increase crime. What a load of rubbish! Actually, the facts show that where it has been put out—in Ceduna, in the Northern Territory, in the Kimberley and in the Goldfields now—crime has actually reduced. The statistics show that kids are now getting better fed, that parents are buying decent foods and that this measure is actually helping the communities. I've spoken to Aboriginal groups and organisations that have said it has benefited and is benefiting them. This is all I said—it's about a bleeding heart attitude of taking away people's rights. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The town of Kalgoorlie was just about to go under. Businesses were fed up with the problems they had on their streets and were crying out for help and for something to be done. It's not only about the businesses here; we're talking about peoples' lives. Enough money has been thrown out to organisations over the years and nothing's changed. We have high youth unemployment in this country. There's no hope whatsoever. We see more and more younger kids turning to drugs, and you've got to ask yourselves why. We are one of the highest drug-taking nations in the world and more people are coming from overseas to peddle their drugs in this country. Senator Bartlett also says that it's harder to make dollars stretch further. This enables them to manage their moneys. It does enable them to spend their money in much better ways. To say that they've got to stretch their dollars further—what do we want? We give people a welfare payment, Newstart or youth allowance. We've got to stop the attitude that it's a way of life. It's not a way of life; it is a helping hand that is set up to help these people. We've got to encourage kids to get out there and look for work, to give them back their self-esteem and self-respect. Do you think that you're protecting them, paying out these welfare payments and saying we can't tell them what they can or should spend their money on? That's not helping them. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking about jobs in the area—that's why One Nation has been pushing for the apprenticeship scheme, which I know businesses will be very interested in taking up. This is something that both major political parties have let slide in this country, by shutting down the TAFEs and apprenticeship schemes. You haven't helped the youth in this country at all. When you have unemployment rates of even 25 and 30 per cent in some of these rural and regional areas then we have a real problem. I say to the people out there: I will be supporting this bill, as any commonsense person would. If you listen to Australian taxpayers, they are thoroughly behind this, because they have to abide by the rules and regulations. Don't forget: it's their hard-earned dollars. Why shouldn't restrictions be put on people to make sure they spend that money wisely? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Welfare recipients should be fully appreciative of this. They should be saying 'Thank you' to the taxpayers: 'Thank you for the opportunity to give me some money so that I can pay my bills and put food on my table.' Why shouldn't we ask that the money not be wasted? Why shouldn't they have an obligation to the taxpayer? But we have members and senators in this parliament saying, 'No, they shouldn't, because you're taking away their human rights'. I say that's a load of rubbish; it's absolute bunkum. We have a responsibility, not only to the taxpayer but to the youth, to ensure that we do our utmost to try and get them off drugs, to stop them wasting their money, to ensure they spend the money in their pockets wisely, and to ensure they are looked after to the best of their ability. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be supporting this bill, and I am pleased to see that the government have proceeded with it. Congratulations to them for bringing this forward, because I know it will help the people in the long run. There might be resistance initially, but I know that, in the long run, as has happened in the other areas, it will help the communities and it will help those young people.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  I've listened to the drama and hysteria coming from the other side of the chamber in relation to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018, and, I've got to say, it's melodrama at its finest. Honestly, some of you in here are worthy of an Oscar. The theatre in here is first-class. Right now, there are three trial areas for the cashless welfare card: one in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, one in Western Australia's Goldfields and the other in Ceduna in South Australia. I wonder how many of you in here have been to these trial sites. I've been to Kalgoorlie-Boulder a few times, once with Senator Hanson for a Senate hearing into the card, and, in all my dealings and all my conversations with community leaders, they've done nothing but hail and praise the cashless welfare card. In fact, Senator McAllister, who spoke earlier, may be interested in this. I have a media release from the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder where the local mayor, John Bowler—who, I might add, is a former state Labor minister—said the card 'is a success'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing to remember here is that the cashless welfare card trial is exactly that: it's a trial. Labor and the Greens want to pour cold water over it, but let's hear from the horse's mouth about some of the successes of this card in some of these areas. Police are reporting that the level of antisocial behaviour on the streets is clearly down. Bottle-shop retailers report that there are considerably fewer disturbances around their premises. Mr Bowler, the mayor of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, went on to say that loopholes, whereby card recipients were finding ways of obtaining cash or liquor on the cashless part of the welfare card, were being shut down and that the number of complaints was falling as the cardholders themselves learnt that in most cases the level of inconvenience was minimal. A media statement also refers to one liquor retailer who reported that the card had seen a decrease in sales of liquor in general through his bottle shop and that this measure, combined with the responsible service of alcohol, had seen a decline in store incidents and street drinking in the vicinity. This is a statement from the Mayor of Kalgoorlie-Boulder only five days ago. He has heaped praise on the welfare card. I'd be more inclined to believe the local leader than some of the antics that go on in here, especially from those senators who are always pandering to their ideological agendas.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. This is an issue that has troubled me deeply. The most recent data indicates that close to three million people, more than 13 per cent of all Australians, are living below the poverty line, despite a quarter of a century of continuous growth. More than 700,000 children are living below the poverty line, and the number has been growing. I find this unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to the cashless debit card, I am alert to the claims of restrictions on the autonomy of people to live their own lives. I'm aware of the deficiencies in the evaluations so far conducted. I noted in my first speech my concern about the failures revealed in the latest Closing the Gap statement. Ten years after COAG agreed on the strategy, the results are patchy at best and scandalous at worst. A decade later, four of the seven targets are nowhere near being met. The target to close the gap on school attendance is not on track, the target to halve the gap in reading and numeracy is not on track, the target to halve the gap in employment is not on track, and the target to close the gap in life expectancy is not on track. The government now wishes to extend these trials to an area with a distinctly different demographic to the East Kimberley, the Goldfields and Ceduna, and to a different cohort focus. That is what this bill specifically deals with.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Bundaberg and Hervey Bay has a high level of long-term and intergenerational welfare dependency … Ninety per cent of the people in this region under 30 and on Newstart or Youth Allowance, had a parent or guardian who received income support at some point in the last 15 years. Further still, of that cohort, around 13 per cent had a parent or guardian who received income support at least once each year for the past 15 years.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have already declared my support for an immediate and substantial increase to the rate of Newstart and, related to that, parenting payments, and I have supported motions calling for an increase of $75 a week to Newstart.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The objective of this trial is to learn more about whether limiting the proportion of welfare payments available to be spent on alcohol, drugs and gambling will lead to a reduction in community-level harm. There have been improvements in the implementation of the card in the Goldfields trial, compared with the initial two trials. I am seeking assurance that the evaluation of the trials will meet the highest standards of best practice so that, after the trials have been completed, the parliament will seek an independent review of the evaluation of the evidence and the data to see whether this drastic approach can work and win broader community support. I noted that the Audit Office found significant issues with the evaluations of the original trials. This is why I believe that the Senate and the parliament need to have an additional safeguard designed to bring about better evaluation of the trials and to benchmark their quality or deficiency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have always said that I will treat each piece of legislation on its merits and on the basis of evidence and data. With that in mind, the amendment that I'm proposing would require the minister and the government to conduct an independent review of the evaluation of the Bundaberg-Hervey Bay trial. The review would have to be undertaken by independent evaluation experts with significant expertise in the social and economic aspects of welfare policy. It must begin immediately; after the minister receives its initial evaluation, it must be completed within six months; and it must be conducted by an independent panel with expertise in the social and economic aspects of welfare policy. The experts would consult participants in the trial and make recommendations as to whether the cashless welfare arrangements in the trial were effective and should be implemented elsewhere.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DEAN SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  I rise this afternoon to talk about a matter of great importance to the electors of Western Australia. It's clear that Western Australians are feeling the pinch of cost-of-living pressures. Cost-of-living challenges are now top of mind for WA families and businesses. A recent survey by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia found that 64 per cent of respondents cited the cost of living—spending associated with groceries, utilities and transport—as a major day-to-day issue. The coalition government's personal income tax cuts are good news for Western Australians and will assist with tackling those cost-of-living pressures by putting more money back in the pockets of struggling families. And there's no doubt that the $530 tax offset will help ease the burden on low- and middle-income families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, as Western Australians get to keep more of their income with the coalition's tax cuts they are again faced with increased fees and charges from Western Australia's state Labor government. WA Labor's 2018-19 state budget landed a further attack on Western Australian families. Failing to recognise the pressure that Western Australians are facing, the Western Australian state government—the WA state Labor government—has budgeted an increase to household charges of 4.8 per cent. This follows from a 7.7 per cent increase the previous year. Compounded, that's an increase of 12.9 per cent since Labor came to power, far outstripping WA's consumer price index rises and, most importantly for WA families, the growth in average weekly earnings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Breaking down those increases in household charges highlights significant issues of policy. For electricity prices, Labor's first budget imposed a 95 per cent increase on the supply charge. The supply charge is a daily rate that is imposed for supplying electricity to a household. It doesn't change with the amount of power used. Prior to increasing the supply charge, the government was advised that the increase would disproportionately affect fixed-income, single-pensioner households. These households paid nearly 30 per cent more for their power in 2017-18, while households using more than the average amount of electricity paid proportionately less. With power prices set to increase another seven per cent from 1 July, fixed-income, single-pensioner households will be paying a compound increase of nearly 40 per cent. Meanwhile, the average household is paying a compounded increase of over 18 per cent. That's something Labor senators should contemplate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For water charges, the story is worse. WA Labor is misusing Western Australia's Water Corporation as a cash cow. Let me explain how. Last year the independent Economic Regulation Authority looked at the charges imposed on families by the Water Corporation and found:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The total revenue expected to be collected by the Water Corporation in 2018-19 from metropolitan customers … plus revenues received through State Government subsidies to cover concessions … exceeds the ERA’s estimated efficient cost of supply by $338.4 million. This is 26 per cent more than the efficient cost of supply in the Perth area, which is $1,326.9 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me make that crystal clear. The WA state government charges households 26 per cent more than the cost of efficient supply in the Perth metropolitan area. The ERA went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This overall outcome masks considerable revenue variation in the three supply sectors:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">For water services, Perth customers would be charged $30.4 million less than the ERA’s estimated efficient cost of supply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">For wastewater services, Perth customers would be charged $365.2 million more than the ERA’s estimated efficient cost of supply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">For drainage services, Perth customers would be charged $3.6 million more than the ERA’s estimated efficient cost of supply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report advised that a reset of the charges could achieve levels of efficient cost of supply by an increase in water charges of just five per cent, a decrease in wastewater charges of 42 per cent and a decrease in drainage charges of six per cent. Importantly, the report also highlighted that the decrease in wastewater and drainage charges would more than offset the increase in water charges. With reset charges, a typical Perth customer connected to both water and sewerage would be better off by about $400 per year in 2018-19.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear: if the WA Labor government wanted to stop gouging Western Australians for water and sewerage, they could drop the cost to the average Perth customer by $400 per year in 2018-19. That's $400 per year in benefit to Perth customers, directly addressing cost-of-living pressures. However, WA Labor's answer to this is to overcharge. That's right: they will charge Western Australian families and businesses more. From July this year, WA's Water Corporation, under the WA Labor government's stewardship, will charge the average household 4.5 per cent more. And, if you're unlucky enough to have a big family and use more than 500 kilolitres of water in a year, your marginal cost above 500 kilolitres will be $4.44, up from $3.17. To put it into context, the ERA report found the marginal cost of water production to be just $2.41. As a result of this overcharging of Western Australian families, WA Labor expects to bank $4.4 billion in dividends from the Water Corporation over the forward estimates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But WA Labor's harshness in budget matters is second only to its budget trickery. WA's latest budget also exposes a unique form of accounting. Thanks to the federal coalition government's record infrastructure program, WA is set to benefit from billions of dollars in upgrades to road and rail infrastructure. Indeed, the 2019 federal budget invests a record $9.8 billion in productive infrastructure projects for Western Australia. For the federal electorate of Cowan, located in Perth's northern suburbs, the infrastructure spend includes major transformational projects, such as funding for the completion of NorthLink WA and improvements to Wanneroo road traffic flow and a substantial contribution to the Morley and Ellenbrook railway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once completed, NorthLink WA will provide a traffic-light-free transport route between Morley and Muchea. It will improve journey times and transport productivity, improve road safety by eliminating four of WA's most dangerous intersections and provide 65 kilometres of a four-metre-wide shared bike and pedestrian path from Guildford Road to Ellenbrook. Residents of Beechboro and Bennett Springs can see the transformation NorthLink WA will have on a daily basis, and we're already experiencing traffic flow improvements delivered by the new interchange at the Collier Road, Morley Drive and Benara Road flyovers. The new Reid Highway-Tonkin Highway interchange will add to these traffic improvements, and construction is on track for a mid-2019 completion of the $1 billion project, which includes $821 million in Australian government funding. Bennett Springs will also benefit from the federal government's $500 million contribution to the Morley to Ellenbrook railway line, with new train stations proposed for Morley, Noranda, Malaga, Bennett Springs, Whiteman and Ellenbrook. The $500 million investment in the Ellenbrook line is part of the federal government's total $1.84 billion commitment to METRONET, which neatly brings me to the creative accounting by the WA Labor state government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The WA opposition has identified matched funding for METRONET that is not in the state budget. While the state counts the federal contribution as revenue, it fails to allocate sufficient funding for the state contribution of this project. As the shadow Treasurer in Western Australia, the Hon. Dean Nalder, has pointed out in state parliament, the government is artificially inflating the effect on the current account position of the state and is artificially deflating the net impact on state debt because it's not putting subsequent state funding into the projects. Given the significant money on the table from the federal government, these projects are not in doubt. They will proceed. But the failure of WA Labor to include the WA state government's contribution in the forward estimates is poor accounting at best. This fanciful accounting treatment understates the WA government's net debt in the forward estimates and can only be described as economic mismanagement on a grand scale. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I conclude my remarks, I must comment on the major breach of trust by Labor with WA voters. Prior to the election, WA Labor claimed they were better placed to improve WA health and education outcomes. While overall health and education spending is increasing due to significant increases in funding from the coalition government federally, WA Labor is taking— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I'd like to give my condolences to Laurie Jr and to his daughter-in-law, Kerri, who did so much to look after Laurie in his later years. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During Laurie's lifetime he made an unparalleled contribution to the working class of Australia. He made an unparalleled contribution to the trade union movement, the peace movement, the education system and, particularly, the vocational education system. Laurie was the single most influential union official in the establishment of the Accord process that delivered the concept of the social wage, as he understood that reliance on industrial action and wage increases alone was insufficient to allow workers to participate in a fair and equitable way in society. Laurie worked with the Hawke and Keating governments and Bill Kelty at the ACTU to deliver universal health care and to increase access to education opportunities for all Australians. Anne Harding, in a report on Laurie in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">National Times</span> in 1979, described Laurie as: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In recent years he has shifted his allegiance from Beethoven to become deeply engrossed in the music of late 19th century Austrian composer Gustav Mahler. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">as a creative personality and fanatical idealist, who drove himself and those who watched him "with a ruthless energy that proved a continual inspiration and with a complete disregard for personal considerations that won him many enemies". </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill Kelty told me last week that when he told Paul Keating that he should meet with Laurie, Paul expressed some concerns, but when they eventually met Bill couldn't get a word in as Paul and Laurie discussed the merits of various classical composers. I think Laurie had a collection of some 10,000 classical CDs. That meeting with Paul Keating laid the groundwork for much of Laurie's work in education reform in Australia. When I last saw Laurie about a month ago, in a nursing home on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, he was still listening to classical music. He was still engaging with the issues that were important for working class Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His influence in the AMWU made it the most influential union in the country, resulting in former Prime Minister Billy McMahon describing Laurie as 'one of the most evil men in the trade union movement'. It hasn't changed much, has it, Senator Cash? The Liberal Party haven't really changed since the sixties. Their twisted assessment of trade union officials who dedicate their careers to looking after working people in this country is just crazy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Laurie was a working-class intellectual who started his working life as an apprentice fitter at a can-making factory in Victoria, where he was appalled at the conditions suffered by the production workers, who were mainly female workers. He became an activist in the Amalgamated Engineering Union and, ultimately, assistant secretary of the AMWU before being elected as assistant secretary of the ACTU. Following his career in the union movement, he was instrumental in improving the vocational education system, influencing policy, writing reports and arguing for constructive change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Laurie was passionate about union education. AMWU delegates were encouraged and trained to understand economics, history and politics from a working-class perspective, and they had to be good public speakers. It was the influence of union education that equipped so many union activists to bargain effectively with their employer. I don't think either I or Senator Urquhart would be in the Senate without the influence and support of Laurie Carmichael, who asked me to read widely, study politics, and be an activist in the workshop and in the community. When I first asked Laurie, 'What should do I to be a good union delegate?' he gave me a list of about 10 books to read, and that was the position he took—that you had to be educated and you had to understand the issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The influence of the Depression, worker exploitation and the power and privilege held by the elite caused Laurie to gravitate to joining the Communist Party of Australia. Laurie was a past president of the Communist Party. He believed the essence of Marxism was the promotion of revolutionary change from a capitalist, exploiting society to socialism in the most democratic way. He viewed Marx's concept of socialism as being one that would create the most democratic type of society known to mankind. Laurie was very disappointed and, like many Australian communists, disavowed what happened in the Soviet Union some years ago. In my view, Laurie never wavered from his view that capitalism needed to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Laurie played a major role in defeating the Liberal Party's penal powers, and he was active in coordinating the trade union movement's response to the jailing of Clarrie O'Shea. He was a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War and spoke at the Melbourne moratorium rallies in front of hundreds of thousands of concerned Australians. Laurie's son, Laurie Jr, was a conscientious objector and became the focus of the anticonscription movement in Australia. Both Laurie and his wife, Val, were arrested when they were actively supporting their son at a demonstration outside Williamstown court, and I think Val was injured by the aggressive position the police took. Laurie was also arrested in Western Australia when the conservative government introduced laws designed to stop workers coming together to demonstrate or organise against employer excesses. None of this would stop Laurie from continuing his campaigns on behalf of working-class Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bert Evans, the legendary employer advocate and leader of the Metal Trades Industry Association, said that the Accord would not have been delivered without the ability of Laurie Carmichael to deliver on commitments that unions would no longer pursue extra claims. Evans said that doing a handshake deal with Laurie Carmichael was enough. Former ACTU Secretary Bill Kelty described Laurie Carmichael as an exceptional human being whose actions had a massive impact on Australia's industrial relations landscape. He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is hardly a condition of employment that was not affected by the campaigns that he led … </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He is to Australian trade unionism what Mozart was to music, Pharlap to horse racing, Wally Lewis to Rugby League, John Coleman to Essendon supporters and now Barack Obama to people throughout the world - simply an inspiration!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Laurie Carmichael was one of the most intelligent, hardworking, active human beings I had ever met. We owe Laurie Carmichael a lot. Working people in this country owe Laurie Carmichael a lot. I think Laurie was appalled at the situation working people find themselves in now, with no capacity to bargain effectively and no capacity to increase their wages and conditions under a coalition government.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BARTLETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  Many of the people in this building are probably preoccupied with the political soap opera happening around the place, but I'm sure the Australian public would be much keener if there was a continuing focus on what was supposed to be the big focus this week of the government, which was an attempt to bring down energy prices and to do so in a way which would be compliant with our obligations to also reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, this government is focused on tearing itself apart whilst Australians continue to face significantly and unnecessarily excessive power prices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, all of the 16 different variations the government put forward in their so-called energy guarantee wouldn't have delivered the sort of price cuts to electricity costs that Australian households are keen on, and it certainly wouldn't have delivered anti-greenhouse emissions. So, in that sense, the fact that that whole plan is dead is of no great loss, because it wouldn't have delivered anything of value to the Australian community over the long term. In fact, it would have caused more harm. But it should not mean that the issue goes off the agenda. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have promoted and put forward workable solutions for significant reductions in energy prices for a number of years now. In the lead-up to the state election in Queensland, the Greens released a comprehensive package that was independently assessed by a well-known expert, Hugh Grant, and not only was it found to be effective and valid but, indeed, it would have delivered more cuts to households in terms of electricity prices than the policies put forward by either Labor or the Liberal National Party of Queensland. One Nation, as far as I know, didn't put forward a policy of any substance at all, which is pretty much what you could say about most of their issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's pretty simple, really. The government managed to tear themselves apart after they finished tying themselves in knots around this issue, but it's actually pretty simple if you know what you stand for and if you're about putting the community first rather than corporations. We want an energy system that runs for people, not for profit. The measures the Greens put forward would save people up to $600 a year on their electricity bill. A simple, clear thing we can do to reduce power prices is to roll back privatisation. The chances of the Liberals or Labor doing this are minimal, because they both take money from the energy companies, who are making record profits with their price gouging. Families are being driven to the brink while corporations make record profits and CEOs get fat bonuses. This is not just rhetoric. Last year 21,000 households in Queensland alone, not counting the rest of the country, had their power cut off because they couldn't afford to pay their electricity bill. After food and water and having secure housing, electricity is pretty much the next thing in line when it comes to the essentials of life today. I think we would all agree that it is an essential service to ensure that people have reliable electricity and affordable electricity. So, it should not be an area where corporations make massive profits while people pay soaring bills to fund those profits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Removing climate change targets won't bring down power prices; stopping gouging by private corporations will. In Queensland, Labor privatised the retail arm of the electricity sector in 2006 and prices have nearly doubled. Those energy corporations are making record profits whilst tens of thousands of Queensland households have had their power cut off. Pensioners and unemployed people are skipping meals to make sure they can keep the lights on and the heating on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to transition government-owned energy corporations back to being public authorities that are putting people first, not profit-making. Even those parts of the sector in Queensland that weren't privatised, as in other states, were nonetheless corporatised. Up to 40 per cent of our power bills in Queensland is profits made by state-government-owned energy companies and private corporations. Last financial year, the state government made $3 billion from the profits made by state-owned energy companies, money that came straight from the pockets of Queensland households. Origin and AGL made over $7 billion in profits. If they come back not just under government ownership but under government control and regulation, and are regulated in a way that doesn't allow billions of dollars—</span>

                  </a>  You also need to eliminate corporatisation and stop governments being able to direct their government-owned corporations to gouge the public. Make government responsible and be able to regulate prices to ensure that there are not massive profits being made out of the pockets of Queensland households. It's pretty simple.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator BARTLETT:</span>
                  </a>  It is in the power of governments to do something about it. Because both Liberal and Labor are so caught up still in the neo-liberal agenda of putting profits first, in letting market forces deliver supposed benefits to the community, they can't see that there are other approaches that will work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the approach that the Greens put forward, and it is an approach that independent energy analysts have said will deliver. Alongside rolling back privatisation, having public ownership, having government control, and having a long-term legislative objective to require prices to be set in a way that doesn't allow price gouging, we can also invest in renewable energy. Again, every independent observer who's not an ideological warrior will recognise and say that expanding renewable energy is the way to reduce power prices. Killing the renewable energy industry, as this government wants to do, and funding coal-power generation won't push down prices; it will push prices up. It will not deliver jobs and it will not, of course, deliver the sorts of emissions reductions that every independent scientific analyst recognises we urgently need to deliver. The economic harm, let alone the environmental harm, from continuing to allow runaway climate change, because of a lack of political will to reduce emissions, will hit all of us and it will, of course, hit poorest households hardest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can invest in continuing to roll out renewable energy generation, which is creating jobs in regional and rural parts of the country, including in Queensland. The proposals the Queensland Greens put forward of investing adequately in renewable energy generation would not only reduce prices but also create up to 5,500 full-time jobs in design and construction every year for five years. That doesn't include operation and maintenance jobs, which would be additional and ongoing beyond that. That's if you had the political will to fund activities that will not only generate jobs but also reduce electricity prices. Instead this government wants to give those gouging corporations more tax cuts. Thankfully, at least today the Senate managed to roll back that effort to give back even more money to companies already making record profits while households dealing with energy prices, which this government is now doing absolutely nothing about, face continuing wage stagnation and job insecurity. That is the focus for the Greens. That is the approach we will continue to put forward leading up to this federal election, whenever it might be called.</span>

As to his argument that, if we can get it concentrated in public hands, it will inhibit gouging, he forgot to mention the unfortunate fact that we are being gouged in Queensland, more than anywhere else in the country, by a government who own the energy generators.

Others may have a view that he could and should have expressed himself differently on some subjects; nonetheless, where can we have free and fearless speech in relation to subjects that, in our own minds, are of national interest if not here in this chamber and in the other place?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We then saw the example where I moved a general business notice of motion which in effect is criticising the changes of law relating to abortion from the government of my home state of Queensland. For those who are not familiar with my home state, we have very settled criminal laws that have been in place to protect principally women. All abortions are obviously related to the female gender. I think in 1976 or 1977 there were changes to the laws, and since that time there has been only one prosecution amid quite literally hundreds of thousands of abortions—a practice that for the largest part I don't agree with. We can all get caught in the debate about exceptional circumstances. If one day we get to a point in society when we are just concentrating on the merit of exceptional circumstances, I'll probably feel my work here is done, and I'll quietly not engage in the debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact of the matter is I moved a motion in this place that criticises the state government's intention to make changes to the legislation up there. These are not just adjustments; these are radical changes. These will remove all of the protections, many of which are for the women who find themselves in this unenviable position, struggling with a decision around the termination of a pregnancy. They have foreshadowed that they will include, for example, the ability to prosecute a medical practitioner who refuses to perform an abortion or facilitate it for a patient. Think about that: state sponsored prosecution of a medical practitioner, who has taken the Hippocratic oath, which is very clear on the question of preservation of life. If they conscientiously object, they run the risk of being prosecuted as a result of their objection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a motion to this floor like many hundreds—in fact, possibly thousands—since I've been here. I don't have a memory of a challenge of formality on a motion simply because some found it controversial or some found it inconvenient. I've seen challenges to formality in relation to motions that convention has long said ought not be debated in this chamber—motions relating to matters of foreign policy and the like—and I support that, but I've not seen formality denied just because the motion offends the senses of some.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't labour on this, but I promise you that for the next year you're going to get one or two every day, as long as I can change the language in them sufficiently, and you can deny formality every time. As you know, I have a contingent motion and I'll just rise to my feet and make the same argument every day until finally someone surrenders. I will also be denying formality on motions of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens every day now, consistent with their argument as to why formality should be denied. I'll do that until such time as we can sit around the table, smoke a bit of peace pipe and decide how we might allow ourselves to return to an environment in this place that allows free speech to flow even if you are offended by the free speech of others. Using procedures in this place to inhibit free speech has to be the most offensive practice when having regard to this chamber of freedom, where we should be able to raise issues that are important to us and, in many cases, to many hundreds of thousands, indeed millions, of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where to from here? I often regard chambers like this and the other place as being the end of the cul-de-sac. People want to bring change to their nation. They want to bring a policy change. They want to bring political change. If not here, where do we send them to be able to achieve that? If not here, where we can and ought to have free speech to address and debate critical issues, where do we send them? In nations where that doesn't exist you send them back to the streets. That's where you send them. You send them back to the streets. I don't want to scaremonger. We've got a very stable society here in Australia, and I don't think that that is even a slight risk. But in the fullness of time, if they cannot come to the political chambers of their country and have their issues presented, to test who sits where so that they can continue to strategise and engineer how they may influence legislators like us, then where do you want them to go? Out to Twitter or Flickr? I don't know the names of these things but there are lots of them apparently. If you know how to operate your device you can get into those chambers where there's a freedom to say whatever you like without having to produce any evidence that gives effect to it. We have seen the effects here with Senator Hanson—</span>

Every one of you will want to rise to your feet and open debate or test the position of your colleagues on some important subject matter, and I'll be in the chair down there denying you formality to do that. I'll do that as frequently as I have to until we realise the impact this changing trend that's been occurring in this chamber is having. It has to cease. We need to get back to being able to fearlessly put a view. It doesn't matter what reaction it generates. We have to have the right to do it. The Australian people, I think, are watching us and want to see just what direction we take.</span>

                  <a href="122087" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  I rise today to talk about the operations of the National Disability Insurance Agency and how they are affecting the National Disability Insurance Scheme and its clients in the Northern Territory. Last month I was advised by local stakeholders that they were very concerned at reports that senior NT management at the NDIA would be relocated interstate. This raised a lot of concerns for me and particularly for those people and families in remote regions trying to access services under the NDIS. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I'd like to make the strong point that local issues need local solutions. We already know there are serious concerns with the operations of the NDIS in the Territory. Moving the decision-maker thousands of kilometres away would not make the NDIS better for Territorians. The NDIS exists to improve the lives of people with disabilities, and, to ensure this, National Disability Insurance Agency staff must be employed locally and have the authority to fix issues. Local advocates are clear about the need to have local knowledge and on-the-ground expertise as the scheme rolls out in the Northern Territory. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Solomon, Luke Gosling, and I wrote to the Prime Minister last month, raising the concerns of our constituents. I might share with the Senate what we said in our letter to the Prime Minister. We said that the decision to shift NDIS management out of the Territory does raise serious concerns about the government's ability to deliver the locally adapted services Territorians with disability need. In the latest quarter, over half of all NDIS participants were using less than 50 per cent of their plan, and this means people are missing out on the support they need. In many cases, across the Territory, this is because a genuinely local approach to making sure services are available is not in place. Local issues do need local solutions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We haven't heard back from the Prime Minister. I understand that his attention is focused on other issues. But, again, let me say to the Senate: even those issues that are distracting the Prime Minister and the cabinet have a profound impact on the needs of Australians out there, who need members here to take responsibility and do their jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Noelene Swanson, the NT state manager of National Disability Services, Vanessa Harris from the Northern Territory Mental Health Coalition, and Liz Reid, the president of Physical Disability Australia, chair of the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations and NT representative on the NDIA Independent Advisory Council, have worked and lobbied tirelessly not only on the issue of retaining senior NDIA staff in the Northern Territory but also on the need to improve the model for the NDIS in the Territory. They deserve to be heard and listened to. Their views about the need to have local solutions and local resources need to be taken into account. But the voices and concerns, the lives of people with a disability in the Territory obviously don't rate a response when you are too busy being distracted by what is currently going on with our government. We have a unique set of circumstances in the Territory. We know we have some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people living in our remote regions who need improved access to the NDIS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reports on the NDIS have highlighted low take-up rates in the Territory and high levels of unmet need. Earlier this year, an independent evaluation of the NDIS found the scheme's trial around Tennant Creek did not improve the local supply of disability services and unmet demand remained high. The review found that outcomes for NDIS participants were variable, with those with stronger English language and advocacy skills fairing so much better than others. The authors said that the key promise of the NDIS of choice and control for people with disabilities remained an almost theoretical concept in the Barkly Region because of a lack of services. The report stated that the NDIS trial in the Barkly Region was never expected to be an easy task—for senators here, the geographic position of the Barkly: it is around the Tennant Creek region of the Northern Territory and covers a vast area right up to just below Katherine and certainly above Alice Springs—and that the number of participants in the NDIS did not reflect the high levels of disability within the region. It highlighted that outcomes for NDIS participants were variable and poorer for those living in Aboriginal communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the evaluation period, they concluded that both its approach and its implementation were ineffective and that the NDIS had not managed to adapt sufficiently to the specific needs of the region. This indicates a need for more locally led and place based tailored solutions to planning, market development, access to services and risk management as described in the bilateral agreement. Consistent strategic intent is fine. How that is led and implemented locally needs to vary to suit the circumstances. Centralising leadership and decision-making for the majority of the NDIS functions will further delay decision-making and much-needed service development for the people of the Northern Territory. No other jurisdiction has the combined demographic or geographic features of the Northern Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS is here to improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians with a disability. Under the Turnbull government, it has been hampered by lengthy delays, plans having to be constantly reviewed and people simply not getting the support they need. The NDIA earlier this month announced a new structure, but advocates are still wondering why the NT's local NDIA manager has authority only over planning issues. The Turnbull government needs to lift the staffing cap for the NDIA. It also needs to ensure that senior staff are available to manage the rollout of the scheme locally. Territory disability advocates were very happy to hear the announcement from my colleague in the other place the member for Barton that a Labor government will remove the Liberal's arbitrary NDIA staff cap. This will free the agency so that it will be able to make the best long-term decisions about how to deliver quality services to Australians with disability. Last year, the Productivity Commission recommended that the staff cap be scrapped. Disability advocates have been calling for its abolition for years. And the staff cap is a relic of the former Prime Minister Abbott's horror 2014 budget and creates a perverse incentive to rely on contract staff and outsourcing despite the NDIS being the biggest social reform since Medicare. The staff cap has no impact on NDIA's overall funding level, which will not need to change with its removal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, the NDIA has committed over $145 million for contract and temporary staff, outsourced call centre functions to the multinational Serco—the equivalent of up to 380 full-time jobs at a cost of $63 million over two years—and spent over $61 million on consultants in 2016-17 and 2017-18 alone. At the same time, the scheme's rollout is currently behind schedule—the equivalent of over 46,000 people missing out on the NDIS. People with disability have faced massive plan review backlogs and have missed out on the essential supports they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to take the roadblocks out of the way of the NDIS. People with disability need to be at the heart of everything the NDIS does. It exists to provide essential services, not to line the pockets of multinationals. NDIA staff do work hard and try their very best with what they've got. This arbitrary staff cap is just putting more unnecessary pressure on them. The staff cap creates a false economy, forcing the NDIA to rely on outsourcing and contractors, which is often more expensive. The cap makes it harder to develop a first-class public sector workforce with the outstanding skills in delivering disability supports that will be needed well into the future.</span>

                  <a href="BK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  If Labor and the Greens, supported by Senator Fraser Anning, thought their stunt on Monday would silence me on immigration, they are dreaming. The Labor-Greens alliance is afraid to tell voters that from December 2005 to December 2016 Australia's population grew from 20.5 million to 24.4 million and that 62 per cent of this growth was from overseas immigration. Further, they are afraid to ask voters at the next federal election the question, 'Do you think the current rate of immigration is too high?' Fear that this information will be given to every voter at the next general election is a reason Labor and the Greens voted against debating my private senator's legislation entitled the Plebiscite (Future Migration Level) Bill 2018.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know voters are concerned about the level of immigration and the pace of population growth, but what is less well known is that Labor and their partners, the Australian Greens, need very high levels of immigration for their political future. Labor holds all the seats where the overseas-born population is above 50 per cent and heading for 60 per cent. Labor holds the vast majority of seats where the overseas-born population is above 40 per cent and heading for 50 per cent. These electorates are close to Sydney and Melbourne. How does the government expect new migrants to learn about Australian values and Australian law when everyone around them was born overseas? Over 40 per cent of the members of the lower house in this parliament represent electorates where over 30 per cent of the population was born overseas. Is it any surprise the Lowy Institute survey found a sharp spike in anti-immigration sentiment in 2018, causing their annual sentiment measure to change from positive to negative? The same survey found four out of 10 Australians say, 'If Australia is too open to people from all over the world, we risk losing our identity as a nation.' No other comparable country in the world is pursuing legal immigration at a pace where the population is growing at 1.7 per cent a year. How do we expect migrants to develop a sense of belonging when the majority of migrants settle in regions where people born overseas outnumber people born in Australia?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some in the government have acknowledged we need to slow the rate of immigration, but Labor and the Greens want higher levels of immigration than we have today. If voters are experiencing problems with 200,000 permanent migrants a year, just imagine what Australia will feel like when Labor returns to permanent immigration levels of 300,000-plus. Who is to say the immigration level under Labor will not be much higher?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and their partners, the Australian Greens, are playing a high-risk game of poker with our future and the future of our children. These socialist parties want the next election to be about anything but immigration, but every issue keeping Australians awake at night is related to immigration. Immigration levels are now just too high for us to manage. For the majority of Australians, however, high immigration levels mean poorly paid jobs, high electricity and water prices, unaffordable housing, long waiting times for access to health services, insufficient money for schools, and congestion on public transport and on our roads. Australian voters need to understand the next election is about immigration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation's policy on immigration has been misrepresented, and it is time for me to set the record straight. We recognise the invaluable contribution of overseas-born Australians. They have enriched our culture and committed to our values, our law, our political institutions and equality of the sexes, and I thank them. When they come to embrace our way of life, not to change it, the contribution of migrants and their families to Australia is undeniable. Most Australians believe multiculturalism has been good for Australia, but the right to express cultural identity comes with a responsibility to accept Australia's liberal democracy, and to read, write and speak English.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I support English as Australia's official language because it's a unifying force and it advances migrant communities as well as Australia's interests. Labor and the Greens believe hand gestures and a few words of English are enough to integrate into Australia, and that is why they would not support the government's proposed legislation to strengthen the English commitments for Australian citizenship. Right now, the English standard required for citizenship is getting 12 out of 20 multiple-choice questions right. This is the lowest standard of any comparable country in the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a country taking in migrants speaking over 100 languages, English helps us get along together, and that is critical to the working of our democracy. Parliamentary business is conducted in English, and the record of the parliament is also in English. How can we expect anyone to cast an informed vote if they cannot understand, in English, the issues of the political parties seeking their vote? There is no guarantee that information provided in other languages is accurate. Of course, it suits Labor to have as many voters as possible unable to understand their poorly thought out policies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation's legislation to amend the Australian Citizenship Act 2007, titled the Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Commitments for Australian Citizenship and Other Measures) Bill 2018, is currently before a Senate committee. Similar legislation was withdrawn by the government because Labor and the Greens would not support strengthening the commitments required of migrants to gain citizenship. These commitments relating to core values and English requirements are essential to integration. Labor and the Greens do a disservice to new migrants, especially those here under the Humanitarian Program, when they keep expectations low, because English is necessary for employment and participation in our society. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and their mates in the press find it offensive when I say Australia has the right to choose the number and mix of migrants to ensure that immigration is in the national interests of existing citizens. I will not apologise for saying the interests of existing citizens come first. Australia's Constitution prevents us from asking the religion of those who seek to migrate to Australia. But, equally, we cannot ignore their potential to integrate into Australia. I believe we should add this criterion to our assessment process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at countries with high living standards, we can see that they have relatively small populations and that those populations are in harmony with the natural carrying capacity of the country. One Nation believes the best population growth comes from Australian citizens having children. We want Australians to have the number of children they can afford to look after, but we also want to reduce the barriers to Australians having children, including lowering the cost of housing—something which would follow a reduction in the cost of immigration. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments, both Liberal and Labor, have based their immigration targets on the ridiculous belief that high rates of immigration will prevent or slow the ageing of Australia's population. Yes, migrants are younger on arrival than the average Australian, but migrants get old, and the only way to keep Australia forever young is to increase year on year the number of new young migrants settling permanently in Australia. This population Ponzi scheme will end when social cohesion breaks down, and that day is not as far away as you might think. Governments, both Liberal and Labor, argue that immigration is good for the economy, but economists know that immigration benefits specific interest groups like property developers. In the short term, immigration reduces per capita income, which is why wage growth has been low and will stay low. In 1945 we were short of labour and it was thought that we needed to be a much bigger population to defend ourselves, but today we are a population of 25 million people and there is no need to have the highest level of legal immigration in the world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Life in regional and remote Australia can be very rewarding. Regional and remote Australia is home to much of our mineral and resources wealth, including agriculture, and many of the great wonders of our natural environment. Regional and remote Australia generates more than half of the nation's export wealth. Northern Australia, with only five per cent of Australia's population, generates more than 50 per cent of Australia's export wealth. Regional and remote Australia is where we find our connection with Indigenous culture and the mythology that informs our national character.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But life in regional and remote Australia can also be very challenging. The tyranny of distance imposes limits on access to essential and emergency services and often translates to inadequate transport infrastructure, fewer educational options and diminished employment opportunities. In regional and remote Australia, access to the full suite of Commonwealth taxpayer funded services and to the lifestyle and recreational pursuits that many Australians take for granted is an aspiration only, not a reality. The Australian Institute of Family Studies reported in 2011 that 23 to 31 per cent of inner regional families and 36 to 43 per cent of outer regional families had trouble accessing private and public services such as social security, infrastructure, health care, financial institutions, telecommunications and disability support. It's likely these rates would have been much higher than that for remote areas. In 1981 the <span style="font-style:italic;">Report of the public inquiry into income tax zone allowances</span> noted:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… people living in remote areas … do not receive the same government services as those living in the main cities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">By any estimation this situation fails the fairness test. It could be concluded that there are two Australias: one for metropolitan citizens and another, far leaner version for regional Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regrettably this is mirrored in political representation in this parliament. Out of over 250 parliamentarians, very few represent regional and remote Australia, and even fewer represent northern Australia. In my home state of Queensland I have the support of many of my colleagues in this push to get a better deal for regional Australia. I particularly mention the work Senator O'Sullivan does as a fellow Queensland senator, the work of Mr Warren Entsch in representing our northernmost electorate, Mr George Christensen, Michelle Landry, David Littleproud out in the west, Senator Canavan around Rockhampton, Ken O'Dowd around Central Queensland, Keith Pitt around Bundaberg and John McVeigh in the west around Toowoomba. Those colleagues do understand this and work towards it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One interesting thing about those members that I have just mentioned is that they're all from the Liberal National Party of Queensland, none from the Labor Party. The Labor Party's only representation in regional Queensland and in the north of Queensland is what I often refer to as the 'illegitimate member for Herbert', who won her seat by 37 votes when there were 200 cases of double voting and many examples and evidence of people who wanted to vote and couldn't. The member for Herbert is based in Townsville, as I am. She concentrates on Townsville matters—</span>

                  </a>  I always know that I'm getting somewhere when the Labor Party keep interrupting me, calling quorums and raising points of order that are fallacious. In response to Senator O'Neill's interjection, 'You should take it up with the AEC,' you can be assured that I have, because the AEC didn't bother to tell anybody, including either of the candidates, within the time limit for appeal to the Court of Disputed Returns that there were 200 cases of double voting in the electorate of Herbert.

There is Mr Entsch, me, Mr Christensen, Michelle Landry, Senator O'Sullivan, and three from the Northern Territory, including you, Madam Acting Deputy President McCarthy, and Melissa Price from the north of Western Australia. Out of a parliament of 250, that's not many. So you can understand why it's not always front of mind. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1945, the then Treasurer, Mr Chifley, introduced amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act to create a tax zone allowance scheme in an attempt to refer some fairness to the uneven taxation burden borne by regional and non-metropolitan taxpayers. In his remarks to the House of Representatives, after noting that the district and regional allowances provided to workers in rural and regional Australia at the time were designed to address those inadequacies, Mr Chifley said that:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It must be admitted that people living in remote areas incur greater expenditure when they send their children to secondary schools, or when they send their wives and families away for holidays, than are those who live near the coast or in more settled areas. Therefore, I make no apology for recommending the zoning proposal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In those days, in 1945, the 40 pound and 80 pound allowances given to people living in rural and regional Australia were adequate and did, to a degree, address some of the disadvantages that people living outside of the metropolitan areas suffered. Had those figures been indexed since that time, the allowances would now be something like $5,000 and between $15,000 and $20,000. If those allowances were provided now, they would, in some small way, compensate for the additional cost of living that confronts people living in remote Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is high time that the parliament, in particular, had a look at this proposal, at the disadvantages of living in the 'second Australia', and had another look at that zone tax rebate scheme. It is a matter that I think should be looked at. It could be relatively easily addressed and it could actually provide some real incentive to help those living in regional and remote communities. I was up in the north-west of Queensland the other day and one of the councils was saying that they have a position available but simply could not offer the sort of money to get someone out of Brisbane or Sydney to come right up into the north-west of Queensland to work there. The job is good, and once they got there people would love it, but the cost of living is so much more, so the council, in this instance, would have had to pay an amount for wages that they wouldn't be able to justify. That's where the zone tax scheme originally came in and it should be looked at again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've put a proposition to the Prime Minister, and my colleagues have joined me, that the current zone tax rebate scheme should be seriously looked at again. I'm not going to suggest amounts or boundaries, but it really does need a proper investigation by a properly constituted and learned group—a committee, a forum—to see how it could be increased. I would hope that senators who have an interest in remote and regional Australia might join me in this push to try to get some fairness for those who live outside the capital cities.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M0R" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  I rise to speak about the extraordinary story of a young Tasmanian woman, Ms Angela Williamson, who was sacked by Cricket Australia because of her advocacy for women's health. In January this year, Will Hodgman's conservative Liberal government let the only Tasmanian abortion clinic close. This meant that Tasmanian women who made the difficult decision to seek a legal abortion were forced to travel to Melbourne to have a termination. Ms Williamson was one of the first women to have to make that trip, which she did at her own expense. It cost her thousands of dollars and meant leaving her family behind. She has expressed how she felt:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I wouldn't have had to do this if abortion was accessible in Tasmania …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On my way home on the plane I was so upset I decided I couldn't stay silent about this injustice. I took to Twitter—on a personal account—describing the turmoil I went through as a 'disgrace'. Then, because I spoke up for women across Tasmania, Cricket Australia fired me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Is this Australia? Is this 2018?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being frustrated and upset, she made some criticisms on Twitter of the Hodgman government's disgraceful and sluggish response to the lack of abortion services, including its rejection of a motion to re-establish those services through public hospitals. A senior staffer of the Hodgman government, whether of her own volition or following a direction, used a fake identity to send screenshots of Ms Williamson's tweets to Cricket Australia. Just days after an appointment with Michael Ferguson, Tasmania's health minister, to privately discuss her experience, Angela's tweets were examined, her employer was alerted, her private health information was disclosed and she was fired. At the end of June, two weeks after being the beneficiary of a $240,000 grant from the Hodgman government that was negotiated by Ms Williamson in her role as Cricket Australia's government relations and infrastructure manager in Tasmania, Cricket Australia sacked Ms Williamson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, Angela Williamson's offensive comments amounted to advocacy for women's health. No due process, no appeal, no review—sacked. As John Birmingham pointed out, Cricket Australia:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… has no legal authority to decide what makes a comment offensive, and it has never even tried to explain how Williamson contravened any written policy of her employer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Angela was sacked for having an opinion that had nothing to do with her job. Ms Williamson has rightly taken Cricket Australia to the Fair Work Commission to seek restitution for her unfair dismissal and I hope the outcome will disclose the truth of this shocking saga.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The role of both the Hodgman government and its conservative health minister in this abuse of power should not be ignored. It is well known that Michael Ferguson has very conservative views on women's health, and it's fair to ask whether his actions have been motivated by that ideology. Ms Williamson campaigned for women's health and called out poor government decision-making for all Tasmanian women and girls. Angela knows she is not alone in this fight, and, like so many people, I stand with Angela.</span>

As I'm sure senators are aware, yesterday Mr Dutton and Senator Fierravanti-Wells resigned from the ministry. I advise the Senate that the Treasurer is the Acting Minister for Home Affairs, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will have responsibility for the International Development in the Pacific portfolio. I advise the Senate that in question time today and tomorrow, Senator Payne will answer questions in relation to the International Development in the Pacific portfolio and the Human Services portfolio, and Senator Fifield will answer questions in relation to the Social Services portfolio. Senator Fifield continues to represent the Home Affairs portfolio. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Dutton and Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells for their service and excellent work as ministers.</span>

When asked in February whether he could commit to keeping company tax cuts all the way through until the election, the Prime Minister said: 'Yes, absolutely.' On 31 July, the front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph</span> read: 'I won't flip on tax: PM: Exclusive: Turnbull tells colleagues he'll defy critics on big business policy'. This afternoon the Prime Minister stood next to Treasurer Morrison and the Minister for Finance to announce that the government had junked the centrepiece of its economic plan. So, now that you've junked your enterprise tax plan, what is the Turnbull government's economic plan?</span>

You've got to remember that, when we came into government in September 2013, we inherited a weakening economy, rising unemployment and a rapidly deteriorating budget position.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last five years, as a result of the work of, first, the Abbott government and, since then, the Turnbull government, the economy has generated more than a million new jobs. We have cut taxes for 3.3 million small and medium-sized businesses. We have delivered tax relief of up to $530 per year for working Australians. We've cracked down on multinational tax avoidance. We have delivered record jobs growth, including a record 400,000 jobs last year and, of course, more than a million jobs since September 2013. We are getting Australians off welfare and into jobs, with the lowest number of working-age Australians on welfare in 25 years, and we are getting more young Australians into work with our PaTH youth jobs program. We're returning the budget to surplus a year ahead of schedule. We have delivered the biggest reforms to child care. We have delivered new export deals, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We have guaranteed essential services, with record funding for hospitals and schools.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have listed or amended 1,700 medicines on the PBS. Remember when the Labor Party was in government? They made such a mess of the budget they had to stop listing new medicines on the PBS. When you deliver a stronger economy and more jobs and you collect more revenue for government, do you know what happens? You can afford to list more important medicines on the PBS, and that is, of course, what we are doing. We have guaranteed Medicare, with record funding and record GP bulk-billing rates of 86.1 per cent. We are investing a record $75 billion in congestion-busting infrastructure, and the list goes on. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As I've said, when we came into government we inherited a weakening economy, rising unemployment and a rapidly deteriorating budget position left behind by the Labor Party. The budget was deteriorating by $3 billion a week in the 11 weeks between the budget in May 2013 and the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. As a result of our economic policy, economic growth is stronger, employment growth is stronger and the unemployment rate is well below where people had predicted it would be. The budget is in a much stronger position than when we came into government, on a much stronger forward trajectory than when we came into government. Our plan is working. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the alternative? The alternative is the anti-business, anti-opportunity, anti-jobs, politics-of-envy, high-taxing agenda of Mr Shorten, which would lead to less investment, lower growth, fewer jobs, higher unemployment and lower wages. The Australian people will not want to go for that sort of socialist agenda. That is certainly our very strong recommendation.</span>

Yesterday I was pleased to advise the Senate about the Turnbull government's strong job creation record, in particular in relation to manufacturing jobs. Since we came to office in September 2013, almost 1.1 million jobs have been created. In relation to the number of manufacturing jobs in Australia, we saw, in the 12 months to May, an increase in the number of manufacturing jobs by 47,700. This is a good result, but it is only a result because of the policies put in place by the Turnbull government. In relation to growth across the manufacturing sector, we've seen particularly strong growth in food product manufacturing. This actually had the largest increase in jobs, up by 12 per cent, or 23,100. This was followed by machinery and equipment manufacturing, which had in excess of 21,700 more jobs created, up by 20 per cent. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hume did ask about her home state of Victoria. Senator Hume, through the policies of this government, every manufacturer can rise to the challenge and become an advanced manufacturer if they choose to. An example in Senator Hume's home state is a business by the name of Quickstep Holdings. They were the recipient of a $250,000 grant under which they have developed and commercialised carbon fibre composite technology. This company is a great example of advanced manufacturing in Australia. They have actually relocated, Senator Hume, their research and development function from Germany all the way to Geelong in Victoria. They have also worked with Deakin University researchers to refine the technology, including hiring 11 PhD students. This is good news for manufacturing jobs in Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In fact, the approach taken by those opposite—in particular, Senator Carr, obviously, who was the relevant minister—was disastrous for Australia. It is a fact that the former Rudd-Gillard government oversaw one in eight manufacturing jobs being lost in this country—under Labor. That equates to more than 127,000 manufacturing jobs lost under the former Labor government. Compare that to the last 12 months to May this year, and what we see is 47,700 manufacturing jobs created under the Turnbull government. Again, if you put in place the right economic policies, you will see businesses prosper and grow and create jobs for Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

What they don't understand is that you cannot implement policies that will actually tax businesses out of prosperity. If you increase taxes on business, they are not able to prosper, they are not able to grow. When a business is not able to prosper and grow, it is not able to create additional jobs for Australians. It is a very simple proposition: an employer that has to close employs no-one. But those on the other side don't understand this. In relation to manufacturing jobs—as I said, if in Australia we were ever to return to the destructive policies of those on the other side, when we saw, last time, one in eight manufacturing jobs being lost—what more do they want? On this side of the chamber, we will always put in place job-creating policies. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

On Monday, in the face of an outright revolt within his own party room, the Prime Minister junked his government's National Energy Guarantee, the third energy policy that he's walked away from just this year. The chief executive of the Business Council, Jennifer Westacott, said the Prime Minister's capitulation would exacerbate sovereign risk and would 'discourage investment in urgently needed dispatchable power, with serious consequences for prices and reliability down the track'. After junking the emissions reduction target, then the clean energy target and then the National Energy Guarantee just this year, isn't it clear the Turnbull government's division and dysfunction are pushing up power bills and damaging investment in energy?</span>

The work done by the Turnbull government has helped bring down electricity prices and has helped improve the reliability of energy supplies—and of course we will continue to focus on that objective—unlike the policies of the Labor Party. The Labor Party has a commitment to increase the emissions reduction target to 45 per cent. The Labor Party has a commitment to increase the Renewable Energy Target to 50 per cent. You know what that's going to do? That's going to push up the cost of electricity, which is going to hurt households, it's going to hurt families and pensioners, and it's going to hurt businesses and cost jobs. So, on this side of the chamber, we will continue to work to reduce electricity prices and we will continue to work to improve the reliability of energy supplies.</span>

You're not interested in the national interest; you're just interested in your opportunistic, political self-interest. When Mr Shorten has a choice between opportunism and doing the right thing, he will always go for self-interest and political opportunism.</span>

ABC Radio this morning interviewed Niklas Hohne, part of an independent scientific group that studies how countries are tracking in meeting their Paris goals. He noted that Australia will miss our target by a wide margin and will have to implement significantly more policies to meet our 2030 target. He contrasted us with countries that are responsible for two-thirds of the world's emissions that have legislated their targets and are on track to meet them. Minister, for the clarity of all Australians and of the globe, does the government remain committed to Australia meeting its targets as agreed to in the Paris agreement of a 26 to 28 per cent cut in emissions from 2005 levels?</span>

You've got to remember that not only did we meet but we exceeded the Kyoto emissions reduction target. Other countries, countries who take a much more activist position in relation to these things, did not meet their emissions reduction commitments. Australia not only met but exceeded our Kyoto emissions reduction target. We, of course, remain committed to the commitments that we made in Paris and we believe that we can meet and exceed those targets in the same way as we have in the past.</span>

Under current policies, transport emissions are forecast to increase by a further 15 per cent by 2030.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:21</span>):  The Australian people can have confidence that our government will do the right thing by the environment in a way that is economically responsible. We will make judgements at all times to do everything we can to do the right thing by the environment in a way that is economically responsible and that doesn't hurt working families across Australia. You can go to the next election promising to ramp up emissions reduction targets, promising to ramp up renewable energy targets and promising to ramp up the cost of electricity, making it harder for families and pensioners to afford their electricity bills. We'll go to the election with our plan, which is all about doing the right thing by the environment in a way that is economically responsible.</span>

                  </a>  A key pillar of the coalition's plan is to deliver vital social and economic infrastructure in regional communities across the nation through the successful Building Better Regions Fund. I know members on this side were absolutely delighted when Minister McVeigh recently unveiled the second round of the BBRF projects. I'm very proud that we're investing more than $5 million in seven critical community projects around regional Tasmania. They're going to create more jobs and opportunities and build local economies. These are projects that those opposite would never fund, not in a pink fit. In this round alone, across the nation more than 240 projects will be delivering some 10,000 jobs. That's 10,000 families spending more and investing more in their local community, knowing that they are a fundamental partner in the coalition government's nation-building, jobs-growing agenda.</span>

Like I indicated in my earlier answer, this government is delivering critical, job-creating social and economic infrastructure projects across regional Tasmania and right across regional Australia, which, again as I indicated, those opposite will never understand. In fact, even if those opposite cared about our regions, which they don't, they simply couldn't afford to fund these types of nation-building projects.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tasmania we'll invest $2.5 million in Ulverstone to construct their museum and gallery complex, the science centre and planetarium. This project will absolutely transform the town to be a boon to the entire Central Coast region. This will provide volunteering and more learning opportunities, particularly in STEM, and create opportunities to foster local Indigenous art and culture. This government will always invest in the peoples and communities of Australia, unlike those opposite, who want to tax the nation into oblivion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Huonville we're investing $847,500 to develop the Huon Valley Integrated Health Hub. There's $1.3 million for the Northbourne Park Retirement Village stage 2. In Murdunna we're constructing a 90-metre-deep jetty with floating pontoon mooring for berthing of deep draught vessels. These are the types of strategic and targeted investments a government can make when it has its priorities right and when it actually runs an economy that can afford them. These are projects and communities that, sadly, those opposite and their completely hopeless colleagues in the other place—the members for Braddon, Lyons, Franklin and Bass—have never cared about and probably never will.</span>

The first point I should make is that the regional processing centres in Nauru are open accommodation sites, and residents are able to move about freely. The government of Nauru manages and administers the Nauru Regional Processing Centre under its laws. The department does provide capacity-building and funding to Nauru to operate the RPCs and coordinate the contract administration process. The temporary settlement of refugees in Nauru is the responsibility of the government of Nauru, and Nauru determined refugees are eligible for a limited time visa. All refugees in Nauru receive settlement support services, including needs-based case management, income support, cultural orientation, employment and vocational support, and language training.

As a matter of fact, I can provide an update. NBN's annual results show the company continues to make solid progress in delivering a broadband network that will bring enormous benefits to the nation. One point six million premises were activated in 2017-18, making it a record year for customers connected. These additional subscribers contributed to the achievement of nearly $2 billion in annual revenue for the company. These results are light years ahead of those achieved by our predecessors. Take, for example, the total revenue achieved in the 2013 financial year, four years into the rollout. It wasn't $1.7 billion. It wasn't even $170 million. NBN's revenue for the 2013 financial year was $17 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NBN's full-year results do demonstrate that the company is continuing to deliver against its construction of financial targets, despite a slowdown in activations and ready-for-service numbers in the second half. The hard decisions taken by NBN to offer better value plans for higher speed tiers and to pause HFC sales over the past eight months have been rewarded with significant improvements in customer experience. Network congestion has fallen from more than five hours a week on average in June last year to just 25 minutes per week in June this year.</span>

As I mentioned before, 1.6 million households switched over to faster NBN broadband in the last year alone. To date, over 4.2 million services have been activated across the NBN's six access technologies. More than 2.2 million of these services are connected via fibre to the node or basement. The latest access technology to be deployed, fibre to the curb, is also now scaling up with close to 180,000 premises now able to switch on this service. The rollout remains on track for 2020. In a matter of months, Tasmania will become the first Australian state to see the rollout fully complete, something of which Senator Bushby often reminds me.</span>

More than 90 per cent of the state is either complete or has NBN construction underway. In just a few weeks, the total number of premises ready for service in WA will tip over the one million mark, and what is even more stark is the number of connected services achieved in WA since 2013. When we inherited the NBN project, contractors had downed tools in WA. There were just 109 existing homes who had been connected to the NBN after four years. That number now stands at 434,730. When we add in the non-fixed-line areas, there are now are more than half a million Western Australian premises that are benefiting from the NBN right across the state. It's good news that we're delivering the NBN quickly and affordably to all Australians.</span>

The Prime Minister announced on 22 October, eight days after the marriage postal survey results were announced, that he'd formed an expert panel to review whether Australian law adequately protects the human right of religious freedom. On 18 May the panel gave its report to the government. On the very day he received the report, the current Prime Minister said he was absolutely committed to ensuring freedom of religion is protected in Australia. We know the Prime Minister has a track record of claiming to be absolutely committed to any number of issues which are subsequently abandoned like an unwanted cat. However, if the Prime Minister is truly absolutely committed to protecting the religious freedom of every Australian, why are we still waiting for the report and the government response to be tabled?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bernardi is right: the Prime Minister received a final report into religious freedom from the expert panel, chaired by the Hon. Philip Ruddock, on Friday 18 May 2018. That expert panel received over 1,500 public submissions and held around 90 consultation meetings with 180 individuals and groups representing a diversity of views. The government is very grateful for the work done by the expert panel. The Prime Minister has asked the Attorney-General to lead the government's detailed consideration of the report before releasing it to the public and responding to its findings. As the Prime Minister has indicated, any reforms to protect religious freedom should be undertaken carefully. The panel has considered the issues involved in the review very carefully and it is important that the government has the opportunity to do the same. It would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt the government's final consideration of the report's recommendations.</span>

Obviously, it is always preferable for all Australians, having a diversity of views on a whole range of subjects, to treat each other with tolerance, courtesy and respect. That is always preferable. It is always disappointing when, whatever you view on any topic, people feel that a tribunal or judicial process of any kind is the only avenue left to them.

The independent organisation that has made a judgement in relation to penalty rates was set up by the Labor Party. It was set up by none other than Mr Shorten. He is the one who decided to set it up in a way that was independent from government, because he wanted to protect Australians from a future coalition government. Now, you are asking a coalition government to do what you legislated to prevent us from doing. So, it is your work that is leading to the decision in relation to penalty rates by the independent Fair Work Commission. It is Bill Shorten's work that has led to the decisions of the independent Fair Work Commission. You're just misleading the Senate.</span>

I am very pleased to say that around one million Australian families are benefiting as a result of the Turnbull government's work in investing in around $2½ billion extra into our childcare services to make sure that families are able to access child care without undue costs or undue barriers. Indeed, many Australian families are now making the decision to work an extra shift, to work an extra day, because they're getting more support out of the childcare subsidy. Many families are able to now plan their family budget and their working plans throughout the course of the year, knowing that they won't run out of childcare support midyear, as was the case under the old childcare rebate, where tens of thousands of families throughout the months of February, March, April, May and June would find that their childcare support was just cut off because it had been capped; whereas families earning less than around $186,000 a year find they have no cap under our new childcare subsidy arrangements. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families have the opportunity—they have had cost-of-living pressures eased in the budget because of these changes, many to the tune, on average, of around $1,300 per child per annum. Think about an Australian family with a child in child care getting that additional benefit during the course of the year, coming on top of the extra tax benefit they receive from the Turnbull government's tax reforms, coming on top of the stronger economy that's making their jobs more secure. This is a circumstance where families can have the confidence that they absolutely have—additional financial support, additional financial means, additional capacity to be able to work the hours and days that suit them without childcare costs being an impediment.</span>

We went through a thorough process, getting the Productivity Commission to review and analyse the childcare system before then legislating for these reforms. Around one million Australian families are benefiting. From my home state, and Senator Gichuhi's home state, more than 60,000 families are estimated to be benefiting. From your home state of Victoria, Mr President, more than 200,000 families are estimated to be benefiting. In Queensland, nearly 200,000 families are expected to be benefiting. In New South Wales, nearly 300,000 families are benefiting from these reforms, in WA more than 70,000 families, and, in Tasmania, thousand again. All across our wonderful country, Australian families are receiving additional support, easing their cost-of-living pressures, empowering them to make work and family decisions that suit their personal family circumstances.</span>

Yet what did we see from those opposite or the Australian Greens? They voted against reforms that we estimate are making Australian families around $1,300 per child per annum better off.

It's hard to believe that other senators, those in Queensland, voted against 200,000 Queensland families being better off. Those in New South Wales voted against 300,000 New South Wales families being better off.

If I think about the $130.2 billion in public hospitals, we've increased that by $30 billion—as I said, record funding in each and every state and territory each and every single year. Australian government funding for public hospital activity will increase from $100 billion in 2015-16 to over $130 billion in 2020-21. This will fund more services, more operations, more doctors and more nurses in each and every public hospital in each and every state and territory. Importantly, that—on top of our $550 million investment in the stronger rural workforce strategy—means Australians, no matter where they live in this country, will have access to high-quality, domestically trained doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. We don't make an apology for standing up for better service provision—essential services that Australians need and deserve when it comes to health.</span>

I can say the Western Sydney Airport is an absolute game changer for the people of that region. It's another one of those nation-building, job-creating projects that has been in the too-hard basket for successive governments. But, because we brought the budget under control and because we're taking people off welfare on the taxpayer side of the ledger, with one million new jobs created, we can afford to make these investments—just a tip for you guys over there.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Western Sydney Airport is scheduled to be operational by the end of 2026 with a 3.7 kilometre runway and a terminal with a capacity for 10 million passengers a year. It's not a small investment at $5.3 billion, but, importantly, it's expected to support 11,000 direct and indirect jobs during construction and over 27,000 jobs for Western Sydney after five years of operation—more jobs in Western Sydney and more money injected into the economy. Some two million people will be closer to Western Sydney Airport than to the current airport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new competition will be good for consumers and it will be good for airlines. The new airport will also create more options for international visitors, develop new tourism opportunities and create construction jobs and ongoing jobs. This is a $5.3 billion investment, and, indeed, all of our $75 billion transport and infrastructure investment will be at risk if the Labor-Greens alliance gets back into government and trashes the budget that could allow us to afford this sort of infrastructure investment and the creation of this many jobs. I know I don't have to remind the people of Western Sydney of that. They know that, the people along the inland rail know that and the communities benefitting from the northern Australian roads also know that.</span>

An investment of $5.3 billion will not only improve transport connectivity but create jobs and business opportunities. Local businesses will be front and centre in this project, involved as contractors or subcontractors throughout the life of the project. Industry information sessions have been held about future tendering opportunities. This will result in many new opportunities as well as new major infrastructure that will connect to the airport, such as roads and rail. The Western Sydney airport investment will make Western Sydney a hotspot for employment and small business.</span>

When did the Prime Minister accept Senator Fierravanti-Wells's resignation? And how was acceptance finally communicated to Senator Fierravanti-Wells?</span>

Senator Pratt is quite wrong, and I can refer you to the public record, because Senator Fierravanti-Wells published her letter: she did not offer her resignation; she tendered her resignation. There's quite a difference between offering your resignation and tendering your resignation. Others offered their resignation and, as such, those matters appropriately have to be considered by the Prime Minister.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an extraordinary claim by the minister that simply providing the President with a letter to say that she needs more time should be satisfactory to this chamber. This is a proposition that is not just a matter of a few days; it was first moved two months ago—two months ago. In the first iteration of this proposition, it was directed at both the CSIRO and AIMS; and, in that case of the first iteration of this, the CSIRO had no difficulty responding. But this minister accepts the nonsense that AIMS should be exempted from this proposition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a simple explanation here. The minister's office is absolutely more chaotic than the rest of the Turnbull government. Now, that's saying something. Equally, it's quite clear that this minister is preoccupied with what the Australian Federal Police are doing. She's not concentrating on doing her job. She's not concentrating on actually fulfilling her obligations to this chamber. She's preoccupied with what the Federal Police are saying to her and about the prospects of being charged for what is clearly a criminal offence—the actions that were taken in regard to the AWU raids. It is abundantly clear now: the actions of this minister, who's not able to even manage her office, let alone manage the affairs of the statutory authorities for which she is of course responsible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is equally clear is that there's been a botched arrangement in regard to half a billion dollars being allocated to the Prime Minister's very, very wealthy mates—arrangements that have been entered into because the Prime Minister effectively panicked. He panicked because President Obama, in November 2014, made the observation that he wanted the Great Barrier Reef to be there for his grandkids to see. Some two years later, nothing had been done. This is a government that had a windfall advantage in terms of its receipts. Instead of going through the normal processes of procurement, or through a normal appropriation, for public good research by a public sector research agency, it chose to hand out half a billion dollars, under the most extraordinary of circumstances, to a group of incredibly wealthy men and women that happen to be directly connected with the Prime Minister. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we sought to do was get information from the CSIRO and from AIMS, and two months ago we asked the Senate to agree to an order for the production of documents. The Senate agreed. The CSIRO was able to respond, but AIMS was not, according to this minister. So I reduced the scope of the request, to assist the minister. What do we find even there? That, instead of doing her job, this minister gives us a lousy letter and says 'Well, that should satisfy you.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the normal arrangements in the Senate, the normal courtesies were extended. I waited a little while and then got my office to ring up the minister's office and say 'Well, when will they be available?' In a very offhand way, her office replied 'Well maybe in the next sitting period.' With this government, you wouldn't be certain there will be a next sitting period, because this government is, of course, preoccupied with its own survival, not with meeting its obligations to this parliament. With all the attendant speculation about an early election, I think we are entitled to see what's been going on with the allocation of such an extraordinary amount of money. I understand that the Liberal Party is somewhat distracted this week. I understand that this has been an extraordinary set of difficulties, with the Prime Minister about to be dismissed, probably as early as tomorrow. But I don't think that's any excuse for the minister to allow her office not to do any of its work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, that assumes that you've got a functioning office. In the Industry portfolio, we know that people are flat out even getting an appointment, let alone meeting elementary requirements for the production of documents for this chamber. We know the really basic reason for that is that the AFP takes up so much of this minister's time. We know that this minister has made a great pretence that there's been no fallout from that raid or from her obsession with playing politics with this parliament. But now we know that, over the last 300 days, about all she has done is try to defend her indefensible position, in terms of the fact that there has been such an extraordinary abuse of power by this government in regard to its pursuit of the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party, and in regard to her behaviour.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This OPD was a very simple proposition: the production of documents in regard to the Great Barrier Reef, one of the great international symbols of the future of the environmental questions that face this country. We have the most extraordinary and unorthodox disbursement of the taxpayers' money in the granting of the $444 million to this private charity, with no regular process and nothing resembling due diligence. We know that within the scientific agencies—the people we rely upon in this country to provide that patient science, that public accountability and that expertise, and who can do so on the basis that they understand that the public is behind them and their expertise in being able to deliver the advice to this nation about how to protect one of our great national assets, and indeed one of the great international assets—people have been talking to one another about the consequences of this government's actions. We also know that this grant—which was announced on 29 April and included in the May budget—was made under the most extraordinary of circumstances. We know what is happening in the CSIRO. We know that the officers there said that this was an amazing level of duplication, of waste and of extraordinary capacity to actually frustrate the work of our scientists. We know that this was an outrageous abuse of proper processes, and I think we're entitled to see what AIMS, the other great public research agency in this country, says.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Institute of Marine Science, along with James Cook University and various other research agencies in that part of Queensland, have had an amazing reputation for the quality of their work.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To think that funding a private organisation—a private organisation that has beach parties as, essentially, its key function, and an annual beach party as its main level of activity, for which you pay a subscription to network around a helipad—is the basis on which we should now conduct fundamentally important environmental research about such a massively important public asset strikes me as an extraordinary proposition. The lack of transparency involved with this measure highlights the fact that this government essentially panicked. The Prime Minister's mates at the big end of town thought, 'We can get away with this and no-one will really notice'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know what is a pretty simple proposition: this is a government, whether it be under Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull or perhaps someone else now—we don't really know but it's probably Dutton—that has had an appalling attitude towards science, and this minister demonstrates that in spades. We started with the position under Tony Abbott where there was no science minister at all—none whatsoever. Then there was an outcry and Minister Macfarlane came onto the scene. Then there was Minister Pyne. Then there was Minister Hunt. Then there was Minister Sinodinos. Then, of course, the parliamentary secretary, Senator Seselja. We don't know whether he's in or out of the government. We don't know if he's actually sworn a new declaration of allegiance to the Prime Minister or not. But, given he's the numbers man for Mr Dutton, it's unlikely that any commitment he has given at the moment to be thoroughly loyal to the Prime Minister could mean anything, so we don't really know whether he's in or out. He's certainly not a minister for science: he's a parliamentary secretary and assistant minister. We've gone back to the old position of no minister for science. Every nine months or so, we've got a new person in charge of science in this government. We went from Tony Abbott, where the concept of climate change was not to be discussed at all. The word was a bit like 'innovation', it was to be banned. We went to Mr Turnbull who then said, of course: 'The word innovation has to be used in every sentence, irrespective of the context'. We can only imagine what it would be like with Mr Dutton.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do know is this is not the way to deal with the big issues with regard to the Great Barrier Reef—handing out half a billion dollars to some rich mates, so they can have a beach party once a year. We have to deal with these questions in a substantive way. When this Senate asks for basic documents, we're entitled to see them. Or, the minister should come in here and give a proper explanation, not hand a letter to the President and say, 'I need more time', and think that that will be enough. That's essentially what we've got at the moment. This is a minister that, frankly, is not interested in her job. She's not interested in actually fulfilling the functions of a minister, and ought to resign, along with the rest of this government. We ought to be able to go to the Australian people and let them decide. Let them decide about the future of this country, because, clearly, this government is not capable of it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  What a rambling, pathetic, nonsensical speech—not a speech, a shouting match from Senator Carr. Perhaps the worst minister that even the Labor Party has produced, he presided over the failure of the car industry in Australia and he did nothing, absolutely nothing, for marine science during the time he was in charge of it. And, more or less, with all his political comments, this is the guy who—I understand—the Labor Party didn't want to endorse. The guy who Mr Shorten removed from his front bench, and he only put him back when there was a bit of a revolt amongst Senator Carr's three or four supporters. This is the guy that couldn't even turn up to the preselection of the former Deputy President—the guy who supported Senator Carr, but Senator Carr couldn't even respond and help his mate out at the time of his preselection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who listened to that rambling tirade—that shouting match, that irrelevant speech—mightn't have bothered, because Senator Carr has little credibility in this place and within his own party. I enter this debate only because of some of the outrageous smears that Senator Carr indulged himself in—which should have been addressed by the chair, I might say. The comment that Senator Cash is facing criminal charges is just an outright lie. As has been said in this chamber so many times, Senator Cash is not under investigation. If there is anyone under investigation, it could be a former member of Senator Cash's staff. Whilst the Labor Party rail on about that, we forget what that raid was all about. It was all about Mr Bill Shorten, as the leader of the AWU some years ago, wrongly appropriating some funds to his own benefit. The police investigation is not about Senator Cash but about misconduct by Mr Bill Shorten before he entered this parliament—or perhaps as he was entering this parliament, because he is alleged to have misappropriated money to himself from other sources for his election campaign.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Deputy President, you and members of the Labor Party may not like these comments—which, as you know, are accurate—but when Senator Carr gets up and makes the outlandish, untrue, lying accusations he did then they have to be responded to. I know the Labor Party are fixated with police investigations, because Senator Keneally is in this place now, and two of the ministers from her government are now serving jail terms for real criminal offences. Senator Keneally put these ministers into her cabinet when she was the Premier of New South Wales. These two men were great friends with Senator Doug Cameron. I don't like raising these matters, but when the Labor Party is continually carrying on in a lying way about Senator Cash and others then I have to respond in kind. To paraphrase what that former great Labor leader Mark Latham once said about Graham Richardson, 'If Senator Cameron wanted to go and meet his mates for a reunion party, he'd have to do it in jail,' because that's where the guys who protected Senator Cameron, and whom he subsequently protected, are now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could spend an hour speaking in this chamber about Labor members of parliament who are now in jail. Remember that Orkopoulos fellow, a minister from New South Wales who ended up in jail on paedophilia charges? Remember Gordon Nuttall from my state of Queensland, a minister in a Labor government, who ended up in jail for accepting bribes—proved and convicted in court? I don't like raising these things, but when the likes of Senator Cameron and Senator Carr continually raise lying comments about Senator Cash and others then they can expect this sort of response from me. I could go on with any number of Labor Party people. Remember Keith Wright, the leader of the Labor Party in Queensland, then a member down here, in jail for indecent dealings with children? Remember Bill D'Arcy, a member of the Queensland Labor government, in jail for similar offences? If you go through the annals of New South Wales Labor politicians, you'll find many of them in jail.

Yet they continue to make them. Senator Pratt, for as long as people on your side will continue to tell lies about Senator Cash and others, then you will get this response from me. I'll come next time with real details of members of the Labor Party, parliamentarians from the Labor Party, who are now currently in jail and have been in jail.</span>

                    </a>  You clearly weren't listening, Senator Pratt. Again I'll take your interjection. As Senator Cash and everyone has known—and you know; you've been in the estimates committee with me when these outrageous allegations have been raised—Senator Cash is not under investigation. If anyone is, it is a former member of her staff, but related to what? It is related to a criminal investigation into whether Mr Bill Shorten, the current Leader of the Australian Labor Party, when he was trying to get into parliament, misused $40,000 of other people's money to fund his election campaign. That's what this is all about. That's what the police investigation is about; it is not into Senator Cash, not into Senator Cash's staff but into Mr Bill Shorten and the AWU. As I said, for as long as this continues to be raised by the likes of Senator Carr and Senator Cameron, you'll get the truth back from me about criminal activity—actual criminal activity, proven criminal activity—of Senator Cameron's mates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cameron's mate Mr Eddie Obeid—why is he in jail? I don't have the exact details, but it was something like this, according to the media: he arranged with Mr Ian Macdonald—regrettably my name, but, as I always hasten to add, this was a member of the Labor Party in the upper house of the New South Wales parliament—the bad Ian Macdonald, to give some money to a union guy who could then get a preferential allocation of a coal licence which was worth millions and millions of dollars. It was all arranged by Mr Obeid and the bad Ian Macdonald, one of Senator Cameron's mates. You can understand why the Labor Party, Senator Cameron and Senator Carr particularly, are fixated with police inquiries, because there are so many police inquiries into members of the Labor Party that they obviously dream and sleep it every night. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The attack on the Great Barrier Reef Foundation that I think contained part of Senator Carr's allegation is, again, clearly as unsustainable as almost everything else that he said. The truth of the matter is that this government is determined to look after our marine environment. As I often say, even the conservation groups put out a glossy brochure titled <span style="font-style:italic;">A Big Blue Legacy: The Liberal National Tradition of Marine Conservation</span>. That's not put out by the Liberal Party. It's put out by conservation groups, who go through in detail—and I invite people to have a look at it—all of the serious, actual advancements made in our marine environment by the Liberal and National governments. I've been here a long time and I know the Labor Party have never done anything. The Greens talk about it all the time and do nothing except send their former leader, Bob Brown, in his Sea Shepherd boat up to Cairns harbour and into the centre of the Great Barrier Reef, dropping oil all over Cairns harbour. That's the Greens' contribution to the protection of the Great Barrier Reef! </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, in April this year, announced an additional $500 million investment to secure the future of the reef. That included $443 million to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. If you listened to Senator Carr, you would think the foundation—what he calls 'Malcolm Turnbull's rich mates'; this is how Senator Carr described them—put $444 million in their pockets and went out and bought a yacht, ran a big party, upgraded their house perhaps. That's what you'd think, if anyone believed Senator Carr. But I don't think there would be many people in Australia who would believe anything he said, let alone that accusation. This money went to a foundation with a track record in gaining other money from the private sector to contribute to the Great Barrier Reef. This foundation received that money. It all went through the proper processes and has been ticked off by all the relevant authorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The funding agreement is a robust one, and it sets out the terms of the partnership. That agreement is readily available for Senator Carr to read, if he could be bothered to do that. But, of course, he doesn't want to do that because then he would know the truth of the matter and would know that everything he says is an absolute and outright misrepresentation. The agreement requires the foundation to implement a strong governance framework, including safeguards to provide assurance over the funds, including against fraud, unlawful activities and other inappropriate conduct. It's all there in the agreement. The department undertook a thorough risk assessment of the grant proposal. The agreement requires a detailed planning and design process in the early stages to address the identified risks and successfully deliver this new investment into the Great Barrier Reef. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the government was looking for was a partner who could leverage off government funding, and the foundation has a proven track record on this. It attracts substantial funding from the private sector. It's raised more than $90 million for the reef and, of this, about $87 million has come from corporate, philanthropic and other non-government sources. It's demonstrated its ability to deliver benefits to the reef and deliver government funding appropriately. An example of that is the Raine Island Recovery Project, which it did in partnership with BHP Billiton. The foundation engages some of Australia's leading philanthropists as well as scientists from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, CSIRO, the Australian Institute of Marine Science and universities. The foundation will deliver funds to a range of partners experienced in delivering reef protection action, and it will drive a new capacity and partnership for the reef. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I suspect that Senator Carr, even when he was the minister responsible for science, has rarely been to the Great Barrier Reef. As I have said often in this chamber, I am one of the few senators, perhaps the only senator, who actually lives adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef. I know the Great Barrier Reef. I've been there often. I interact with people in my home town of Ayr, in Townsville where my office is, and in Cairns, representing the people there. I know what happens on the Great Barrier Reef. Senator Carr has no knowledge of or interest in the Great Barrier Reef. All he does is get up in this chamber and make unfounded accusations against hardworking, honest and forward-thinking ministers in this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The money that the Turnbull government is putting into the Great Barrier Reef is for many, many purposes, one of which is the crown-of-thorns starfish. The Greens would have you believe that the crown-of-thorns starfish is simply a result of climate change in the last few years. Of course, the issue of the crown-of-thorns starfish has been going for, I think, about 100 years, but certainly for 50 or 60 years. I remember as a small child hearing about Ben Cropp and his first work to try and address the crown-of-thorns starfish. Part of the money that is being provided for the reef will be to increase the number of boats and the number of divers who go out and pick up the starfish. I'm not a scientist, but that seems to me to be not a terribly effective way of addressing the crown-of-thorns starfish. I have raised it with people from AIMS, the universities and GBRMPA. I've said, 'Is that an effective way to do it?' and they've told me it is. We are going to increase the number of boats that go out and the number of divers who go out and pick up the crown-of-thorns starfish. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In so many ways, this government and our predecessor government are the ones that look after the Great Barrier Reef. I remember when I was fisheries minister that it wasn't much welcomed in the fishing community—although they eventually did accept the sense of this—when a coalition government set up the green zones in the Barrier Reef. Yet you never get a word of thanks from the Greens political party about the real work that has been done to protect the Great Barrier Reef. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have responded to Senator Carr's untruthful accusations and I will do so every time they are raised. I know that the Senate wants to get on with other matters. There is an agenda before us, which the Labor Party often disrupt with these questions about answers taken on notice and documents that have been asked to be produced not being produced. Senator Cash gave a very reasonable explanation of why it has not been possible to give the answers that are required at this time. As I understood Senator Cash, the answers are being sought but they do require a lot of work by a lot of different agencies. She was asked why they weren't. She gave a very clear, reasonable and short explanation of it. That was followed by a 15-minute tirade from Senator Carr about nothing—about nothing that was relevant to the question before the chamber. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For as long as the Labor Party think they can get up and make these sorts of unfounded accusations, besmirching the good character of the ministers of this government, they'll get me responding for 20 minutes to explain the truth of the matter. So, I would hope that they don't continue to waste the time of the Senate with these unfounded accusations and these political tirades being shouted at those of us who have the misfortune to stay in the chamber. But, for as long as they do, they will have me responding to them, because I'm not going to let—I won't use the description I would like to—some senators of Senator Carr's standing besmirch honest, hardworking ministers in the way he often chooses to do. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by Senators Singh and Chisholm today relating to the Turnbull Government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The questions without notice addressed the chaos and dysfunction at the heart of this government. The coalition's focus on itself is having real impacts on everyday Australians. Nothing could be more self-indulgent than the junking action on climate change and energy to turn the focus onto who is the least unelectable member of the coalition. But, sadly, that's exactly what this government has decided to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How out of touch could you possibly get, but to decide to walk away from our obligations under the Paris agreement and instead to look to which alternatives to Prime Minister Turnbull the government could offer? I'm not sure what's worse: the fact that they're asking these questions at the moment or the fact that the only answer they can offer is Mr Dutton. At this time of the coalition's self-obsession, we have a state of rising energy prices, climbing carbon emissions and a range of industry groups in a state of flux—at the very time that businesses and consumers are calling for certainty. How completely self-indulgent can they be, but to turn inwards at such a time? Only yesterday, the leader of the Australian Industry Group, Innes Willox, told <span style="font-style:italic;">RN Breakfast</span>:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And, now that it appears the government has decided not to follow through … with the NEG, we're back to a point where businesses are wondering what's next.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry head, James Pearson, described this government's focus on itself instead of the nation as:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… short-term political opportunism which runs the risk of scuppering vital, long-term policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both of those people have hit the nail right on the head. This government is out of touch. This out-of-touch rabble are more interested in undermining the investment and energy planning of some of the nation's leading business groups than they are in working on a sensible, coherent policy, and it's really starting to hit home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's lack of a coherent policy agenda has seen them trailing in the polls since just about election day in 2016. But we are seeing that it is not just in the polls that people are expressing their frustration. It's not just that these decisions are hurting the ability to progress public policy and climate policy in the best way possible; it's that we're running out of time. As the Property Council's Ken Morrison decried yesterday:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We simply cannot afford to leave the question of emissions reduction unresolved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is facing a drought-stricken winter, with forest fires raging in New South Wales, and this government has decided that it needs to put on hold any energy policy it may have been working on in order to deal with the internal division and dysfunction of the government. They're doing this despite their Liberal colleagues in my home state of Tasmania—and this is Minister Barnett, who is a former Australian senator—claiming:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The NEG is good for Tasmanian jobs and puts more downward pressure on power prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this government is far more interested in its own infighting than it is in placing downward pressure on power prices or helping to generate local jobs. Meanwhile, the member for Braddon, Ms Justine Keay, has continued her passionate advocacy for Tasmania, calling for the government to stay true to its commitments to the north-west coast of Tasmania. She's warned of the impact this government's haphazard policy changes could have and has warned that Prime Minister Turnbull's latest policy backflip threatens thousands of potential renewable energy jobs. Unlike those opposite, the member for Braddon has been a champion for Tasmania and for Tasmanian jobs, just like the rest of the Labor team. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  Regarding the take note motion moved by Senator Brown, as best as I can interpret it—and it was a bit all over the ship—the motion was about the government's national electricity guarantee. And what a good policy that is. It's all about reliability and affordability of electricity prices. Why did the federal government become involved in what is, effectively, and has been for the last 100 years, a state government responsibility? Clearly, state governments weren't able to manage the national electricity supply. We saw that one state, the state of South Australia, under a long-term Labor government, couldn't even keep the lights on. And it was those sorts of catastrophes at a state level that led the federal government to try and do something about it. So we've devised the national electricity guarantee, which will guarantee reliability, so that, when you turn on the lights, you'll actually be able to see something. South Australians would know better than many of us, that is something that should be accepted all the time, but, in South Australia, that didn't happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's more, the guarantee will provide affordability. We will stop the electricity generators, like the Queensland Labor government business entity, Ergon, gouging the market and making huge profits at the expense of Queensland residents, simply so they can make money to shovel into the moribund Queensland Labor government and try and balance their bottom line. That's what it's about. There was an element in the national electricity guarantee related to emissions. Senator Brown said something about that and about the Paris targets. I ask Senator Brown or anyone else who might follow her in this debate to explain to me this proposition, which I keep asking someone to answer, and nobody here ever does, because they've been brainwashed and propagandised to believe that Australia's emissions are bad, but they've never thought them through. They have never exercised any independent thought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Australia emits less than 1.3 per cent of the carbon emissions of the world. I don't argue anymore whether carbon emissions are causing climate change; let's accept they are. Australia emits less than 1.3 per cent. The big emitters—America, China and India—have no targets, or they have targets they talk about but never achieve. In fact, they've pulled out of these international agreements, if they were ever in them. I asked the chief scientist of Australia, 'If Australia reduces its emissions by 100 per cent and we reduce the world's output of carbon by 1.3 per cent, what impact will that have on the changing climate of the world?' And here's his answer: 'Virtually nothing.' That's not from me. The Greens always accuse me of being a climate change denier, which I'm not. It's a simple proposition. The chief scientist of Australia says that if Australia shut everything down, shut off all the lights, stopped every car, stopped every heater or air conditioner or factory, stopped everything, then the difference that would make to the changing climate of the world would be virtually nothing. Yet the Labor Party carry on about decreasing our emissions by 50 per cent because that's going to save the world. Fifty per cent of 1.3 per cent is somehow going to save the world. How ridiculous! How stupid and brainless to carry on with those sorts of allegations. But they think it gets them votes in the inner cities where people don't really follow these things through. I challenge anyone who is going to speak after me to tell me how reducing Australia's emissions by 100 per cent—not just 50 but 100 percent—is going to make any difference to the changing climate of the world. If you can disprove the chief scientist, who said, 'Virtually nothing,' I'll listen intently. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:49</span>):  That was a pretty pathetic deflection by the government, in terms of the chaos that has besieged this government, particularly over the last few days. In fact, we know that there have been deep divisions for some time. I think it's time to remind those opposite that senators and members of the House of Representatives are actually elected to govern for all Australians. The fact is that we see the Liberals are out making phone calls, trying to gather votes to topple the current Prime Minister. They're feeding the media and leaking to journalists. What they're not doing is the job that they were elected to do. What's happening in the Treasury? What's happening in health? We know this government cut funding to hospitals around the country. When it comes to education, we know they have not been able to deliver for schools. In my home state of Tasmania, we can see the effects of the cuts to education. That's not even to talk about the way they have messed up when it comes to Catholic education. They've put them right offside.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a Prime Minister who, when he was elected, said he would be Prime Minister of a stable government. We've seen nothing but dysfunction and chaos from those opposite. Internationally, we are considered a laughing stock at the moment. But what we have to highlight here is how this government, and this Prime Minister in particular, has backflipped time and time again. What we saw at the beginning of the week was an embarrassing backflip on energy. We've also seen that, at last, they've decided to walk away from the out-of-touch rationale they've been using to scrap the energy supplement. It's good that they've finally seen sense there and that Australian pensioners will get the support they need. Now they're pretending that they're going to walk away from the corporate tax cuts and not take them to the next election. How silly do they think the Australian people are? We know that those opposite wanted to give $80 billion to the top end of town. They wanted to give the big banks $17 billion. That's what this government is all about. What they want the Australian people to take away from today is: 'No, we're not going to do that; we won't take it to the next election.' Well, the real threat is that if a Turnbull government—or a Dutton government—is elected at the next federal election, it will reintroduce that, because that's part of its DNA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government, they aren't doing anything about the rising cost of electricity prices for households in this country. They stood by and allowed penalty rates to be taken away from those who needed them most. They've also failed and neglected pensioners in this country. When we talk about aged care, what have they done there? Since they've been in government, in the last four years, they've gutted the aged-care budget by some $3 billion. We have an ageing population, and the government have walked away from their responsibilities. Just last Friday, finally—three months late—they released the data on the home care waiting lists. We're now due for the June figures. How long are we going to have to wait for those figures? There are 108,000 Australians—older people, some of the most vulnerable Australians—who need packages. We know there are some 50,000-odd Australians who aren't getting any support at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's this government. Those are their priorities. I'm seeking to have the government come to terms with getting a decision about who is going to be the future Prime Minister. If it's going to be Peter Dutton, get on with it; if it's going to be Malcolm Turnbull, get on with it—because they have a serious responsibility to govern for all Australians. At the moment, Australians feel like they can't have any faith in politicians. It's incredible that the government want to go down the track of removing a sitting Prime Minister when, in fact, in the last decade, not one Prime Minister who was elected has seen out his entire term. That's a reflection on all of us. So those opposite ought to stop thinking about themselves, and talking about themselves, and do what's right and what's in the best interests of the country—that is, to get along and get their policies out there, as Labor has done. We got our economic policies out there. We're working on policies, because we're listening to the community. I say: bring on the next federal election. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:54</span>):  I've got to say that I've been deeply saddened and distressed by actions over the last couple of days on my side of politics. And it equally saddens me to hear the childishness, delight and hubris from those opposite on the current leadership issues that my side of politics, my party, is facing. As those opposite well know, leadership challenges are no laughing matter for any of us here, and they are certainly not an issue in this day and age for one side of politics or the other—as Senator Polley well knows. These coups, divisions and dissensions not only do damage internally within our own party but do damage to us all. Every time we have these disputes focusing on ourselves, they serve only to damage all of us in this place and all of us in the other place. We can see that year after year in the public opinion polls and surveys on attitudes to politicians and politics. People in our democracy are getting increasingly cynical and disillusioned with us all. These leadership challenges and internal dissensions, which have affected all parties—certainly the major parties in this place—damage us all. They always arise, I think, from a combination of personal interests, egos, grudges and scores to settle. Rarely are they about the national interest. I firmly believe that divided teams never result in better outcomes for Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, while I've been very distressed by what's happened in my own party, I'm equally distressed to hear the comments of those opposite in question time and just now during motions to take note of answers, and that's particularly so when you have a look at what else has happened in this chamber. We've just heard Senator Polley speak out-and-out untruths about government policy. We hear this all the time. Again Senator Polley was talking about the government's record in health—talking about health cuts. She and all of those opposite know that that is not true, yet time and time again they and their 'super PACs', like GetUp! and other organisations out in the community, keep repeating the same lies over and over and over again. They do this for political purposes, for elections, and they're doing it by scaring the most vulnerable in the community, as we saw with 'Mediscare'. To rebut what Senator Polley said, the government will in fact invest $130.2 billion in public hospitals, an increase of over $30.2 billion, with record funding for every state and territory over the forward estimates. Anybody opening up the budget papers will see that what those opposite are asserting over and over and over again is not true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also very saddening to see what happened to the Enterprise Tax Plan in this place today, especially as Julia Gillard, Bill Shorten and many other leading Labor politicians have said for many years that we need corporate tax cuts to remain competitive with our competitors overseas and that we need them in order to keep growing jobs and the economy. Those on that side of the chamber know that full well, but, again, they have exploited things they know and believe for very crass political purposes, which is clearly not in the national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we saw that hypocrisy in full flight. Today Labor and the Greens and several crossbench senators voted for higher company tax rates for businesses. They voted to keep company tax stuck at internationally uncompetitive rates. Our Australian businesses and millions of Australian workers will now be stuck with the second-highest company tax rate in the developed world by 2020. Shame on you all. Those who you purport to represent, the workers of Australia, will be the only ones who suffer. And on that point, I've got to say that I am very proud of this government, particularly of Senator Cormann, who diligently and faithfully sought to implement the enterprise tax policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We did secure passage of the first stage of company tax cuts in May last year. That, at least, provides competitive tax rates to companies with turnovers of up to $50 million. But what those opposite don't understand is that we want those companies to actually reach the $50 million turnover and to keep growing. That is the tragedy of the position of those opposite and also the hypocrisy. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  Every day we turn up in parliament this week, we get more of a display of the Liberal Party's internal civil war. In rising today to take note of answers given by questions asked by Senator Singh and Senator Chisholm, I can see the answers display more and more of the civil war that's taking place within the coalition. At the heart of this is not just a leadership dispute; we can see a complete incapacity to govern and to make decisions in the best interests of our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we have, within the National Electricity Market, energy bills skyrocketing, we've been left with an absolute policy vacuum. While energy bills skyrocket, we've seen a failure to plan for our nation's electricity markets, a failure to price carbon, and a failure to look at prices—all of which could have been addressed, had the coalition had the guts all along to address climate change, and to address the need to invest in renewable energy infrastructure in our nation, to give the market the certainty that it has needed now for a good decade. We've been at this debate for more than a decade. We have forgone billions of dollars worth of investment in our electricity market, because of the policy vacuum that you have created. These are the kinds of debates that are at the very centre of your ideological divide and of the leadership splits that we see taking place today. While you remain trapped in an internal civil war about your own future, what this country really needs is a government focused on the future of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the Labor Party are working hard on our plans to deliver a fair go for all Australians: protecting Medicare, stopping your cuts to hospitals, fully funding our schools and universities, and restoring penalty rates. You are forewarned that, when all we see in your answers to our questions about your internal division is more and more excuses, and more and more division, we will stand ready to deliver for our nation. We have seen in answers to questions a complete unaccountability about what is really going on in government. We asked which members of the coalition front bench had tendered their resignation to the Prime Minister and we were denied answers on that. We don't know which resignations the Prime Minister has accepted. And all we're told now is that it's going to shuffle through in due course with your new announcements. That is no way to govern the country. We have seen that almost half the party room voted against Prime Minister Turnbull. Reports we've seen—and not that the coalition was prepared to discuss this in parliament today when we asked them questions—say that eight members of the ministry offered their resignations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the core policy development taking place in this country, on things like energy, we have been left with a complete policy vacuum. On things like tax cuts to corporations—you've been dogged about this but the simple fact is that you've refused to listen to the Australian people on these questions and you've been left in a position that puts you completely out of touch with the nation's people. It is no wonder that you now find yourself completely riven with internal division, with no place to go. I tell you, Peter Dutton is no alternative and the Australian people know it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator Rice today relating to climate change policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My question was about what a circus our climate and energy policy currently is, in the light of the circus that the leadership chaos in the government is. I asked a question about whether we were meeting our Paris climate targets, and the answer I got back was an absolute failure to answer that question. Minister Cormann announced, quite boldly and blatantly, that, yes, we're on track to meet our Paris climate targets, in complete contrast to the evidence that is all around us, and in particular the evidence that I quoted to him this morning. This morning on ABC Radio National we had an eminent scientist, Dr Niklas Hohne, who studies carbon pollution right across the world. In particular he studies, as part of an independent group of scientists, whether particular countries are on track to meet their Paris targets. He stated unequivocally that Australia, on current policies, will miss its Paris targets by a wide margin. He stated unequivocally that, on current policies, we are going to exceed our carbon emission targets and that we need to have significant numbers of new policies being introduced if we are going to get our carbon pollution down to what we have committed to do in Paris—that is, to reduce it by 26 to 28 per cent. Meanwhile, Minister Cormann tells us blithely that, no, we're on track, when all the evidence points to the exact opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the National Energy Guarantee was going to be inadequate to meet our Paris targets, but the government has now abrogated even that and has stopped attempting to legislate for that 26 per cent cut in our electricity emissions. It's very clear that we're not going to be meeting the reduction in emissions that is required from our electricity sector. The government have abandoned that as a target. They're continuing just to encourage ongoing pollution, to be the coal huggers and to back in the coal industry. That's what the government's policy is with regard to electricity emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to transport emissions, the Department of the Environment and Energy stated quite clearly in their submission to the Senate Select Committee on Electric Vehicles, and reinforced it in the evidence that they gave to the select committee last week, that our transport emissions are actually forecast to increase by 15 per cent by 2030. That's on top of having increased by over 50 per cent since 1990. The transport sector is now our second largest source of emissions, and it's the fastest growing source of emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, the government have failed and have no plans whatsoever to slash our pollution from the electricity sector and the transport sector. They are completely bereft. Under the current government policies, our carbon pollution is going to rise and rise and rise, and that has dire implications. As Niklas Hohne said on Radio National this morning, the countries that are responsible for two-thirds of the world's emissions have actually legislated for their reduction in pollution, and they are on track. So Australia is being a total laggard. Australia is being totally irresponsible. Australia is not being a team player. We are not playing our part in doing what's necessary to prevent climate change, and that is going to have massive implications for us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have bushfires in New South Wales in August, in the middle of winter. We are in one of the worst droughts of Australian history—and, as a cattle farmer was quoted as saying in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian Financial Review</span> last week, 'Don't you talk about drought unless you are also willing to talk about climate change.' We have the death of the Great Barrier Reef. We have our precious animals at risk. We have people's lives at risk due to increasing heatwaves. We are one of the most vulnerable countries when it comes to feeling the impacts of climate change, yet we have completely abrogated our responsibility to do anything to reduce pollution. This government stands defeated in that.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is significant community concern regarding the safety and quality of pet food sold in Australia. When consumers buy any product in Australia, they should be able to trust that it is of acceptable quality and that they will be able to access a satisfactory remedy if not, However, this is not the case when it comes to pet food. There are no mandatory standards of governing quality for pet food. Additionally, consumers who purchase poor quality or dangerous pet food have no clear avenues for lodging complaints with an appropriate regulator.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We the undersigned are of the view that pet food regulation needs to change so that people can have confidence that the products they are buying for their pets are safe. Complaints processes need to be clearer and more accessible to pet owners, so that problems can be identified rapidly and transparently. When problems are identified, businesses should conduct recalls quickly and effectively.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The United States, European Union, and New Zealand all have laws governing the safety of pet food, and we the undersigned believe it is time to introduce similar laws to Australia</span>

They rely on us, which is why it's up to us to do the right thing by them and why it's important that the pet food industry is regulated in Australia. These two petitions contain more than 93,000 signatures showing how important this issue is to Australians. More than 81,000 signatures were collected by Christine and Peter Fry, who are in the gallery today. They lost their beloved dog Vincent to tainted pet food. The other signatures were collected by CHOICE. In the past year, hundreds of owners have lost their dogs or have dogs that now suffer debilitating illness after eating what was meant to be premium dog food. These owners put their faith in the pet food industry, believing it was safe to do so and, sadly, the industry and its safety recall systems failed them and their pets. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Feedback from farmers is that the current net farm asset threshold needs to be increased to allow more farm households in financial hardship to access income support.

                <span class="HPS-Small">Couples in a household will receive up to an additional $6,000 each (split into two payments of $3,000), totalling $12,000 to the household, and single households will receive up to $7,200, split into two payments of $3,600. The supplement will also help local businesses during the tough times as FHA recipients spend their entitlement.</span>

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of this Bill, the Freedom of Information Legislation Amendment (Improving Access and Transparency) Bill 2018 is to introduce measures that make government more transparent and accountable, and assist citizens and the media to access information under the law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Archives Act 1983</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010</span>, and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Information Act 1982</span>. The Bill reflects amendments that were moved to the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These amendments are designed to significantly improve the effectiveness of Australia's freedom of information (FOI) laws. Freedom of information provides the lawful means for citizens, the media, and parliamentarians to obtain access to information that ultimately belongs to the public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These changes are designed to address the considerable dysfunction that has developed in our FOI system which is now characterised by chronic bureaucratic delay and obstruction, unacceptably lengthy review processes and what appears to be an increased preparedness by agencies to incur very large legal expenses to oppose the release of information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also seeks to restore the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) with the appointment of three independent Commissioners as was the intention of the Parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As Senators will be aware, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010</span> (AIC Act) establishes three independent statutory officers; the Information Commissioner, the FOI Commissioner and Privacy Commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, the Information Commissioner, Mr Timothy Pilgrim, is also acting as the Privacy Commissioner while the FOI Commissioner's role is vacant because Mr Pilgrim does not hold the appropriate legal qualifications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Soon after the passage of the AIC Act, Professor John McMillan was appointed as Australian Information Commissioner, Dr James Popple was appointed FOI Commissioner and Mr Pilgrim was appointed Privacy Commissioner. All were appointed for five-year terms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However in 2014, the Abbott Government introduced a Bill which sought to abolish the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. This Bill was rejected by the Senate and after the prorogation of the 44th Parliament, the Turnbull Government decided to keep the office open. However, the vacancies made by the departure of Professor McMillian and Mr Popple were never filled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Pilgrim performed all three Commissioner roles and was charged with the additional task of implementing the 'Open Government Partnership' which the Turnbull Government committed itself to. However he could not fill the FOI Commissioner's role because he did not have the necessary legal qualifications required by the AIC Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Instead he made FOI decisions through a loophole in the legislation that permits the Information Commissioner, a position that does not require legal qualification, to make such decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following Mr Pilgrim's departure in March this year, the three hats of the OAIC have been worn by Ms Angelene Falk who as Information Commissioner and Privacy Commissioner also leads the agency's freedom of information function.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has advertised the position, making it clear that it intends to continue the practice of having a single Commissioner perform all three functions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is hard to credit the Government with a very deep commitment to freedom of information while it leaves the office of the Australian Information Commissioner hamstrung in this way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The specific changes contained in this Bill include:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Requiring the government to fill all three offices of the Australian Information Commissioner, the Privacy Commissioner and the Freedom of Information Commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Allowing FOI review applicants to elect to have their matter bypass the Information Commissioner, who can take more than a year to make a decision on controversial issues, to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Granting an FOI applicant the right to switch a review into the AAT, without charge, in the event that the Information Commissioner takes, or indicates he or she will take, more than 120 days to make a decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Preventing agencies from making submissions to FOI decision reviews that have not been advanced by the agency in its internal decision making, so that they can't switch exemptions half way through a review as often happens now. This would prevent a current practice that, in effect, this allows an agency to remake decision half way through a review, something not normally permitted in merits reviews being run in superior jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Preventing the Information Commissioner from making FOI decisions if he or she does not hold the legal qualifications required of the FOI Commissioner (as happens now).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Preventing agencies from publishing information released under FOI until at least 10 days after the applicant has received his or her copy of the information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Requiring an agency to publish its external legal expenses for each Information Commission or AAT FOI matter that has concluded. This would apply in relation to agency FOI legal expenses and to expenses incurred by the National Archives in respect of applications made for access to information under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Archives Act 1983</span>. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a comprehensive array of reforms that reflect the practical experience of constituents, journalists, researchers and members of Parliament seeking information under Freedom of Information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The passage of this Bill will significantly improve access to government information and with that improve scrutiny of the accountability of government to the Parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Freedom of Information is an absolutely vital part of efforts to ensure that the executive government is accountable to the Parliament and the people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a Senator, and previously as a staffer working for former Senator Xenophon, I have found FOI enormously valuable, if at times equally frustrating. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a pity that more Senators and Members do not take advantage of our FOI laws, flawed as they may be. I would urge them to do so, both in Opposition and in Government, and urge them to look positively at the reforms proposed here. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend this Bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Energy bills are a major concern for Australians, and vulnerability to energy poverty is growing rapidly. It is unacceptable that energy poverty is a daily experience for thousands of Australians, including no fewer than 200,000 children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Energy poverty is exacerbated by the fact that the rental housing market is no longer a step on the way to owning a home, but increasingly a long-term, ongoing necessity for millions of Australians. And as more and more struggle with unaffordable rental costs, fear of homelessness is becoming a mainstream issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Each year at least 100,000 Australians are disconnected from their energy supply, according to the Australian Energy Regulator. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is 273 people per day who simply do not have the means to pay their energy bills. That is 273 people per day forced to endure extreme cold and extreme heat, which, as we know, leads to grave health consequences. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">People who rent are acutely vulnerable to energy poverty. It is estimated that 30 per cent of Australian homes are rental properties, a high proportion of which are low income households. Those households bear the greatest burden of energy costs, as high energy bills disproportionately impact those worse off. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In particular, low income people who rent typically reside in the most energy inefficient homes and use the most energy inefficient appliances, unnecessarily exacerbating energy poverty. Unfortunately, those households typically lack the means to upgrade the energy efficiency of their properties, even when the benefits of doing so would often be substantial. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Another reason why energy poverty disproportionately affects people who rent is that our tax code perversely incentivises landlords to retain energy <span style="font-style:italic;">in</span>efficient rental properties. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the current tax code, landlords have no incentive to undertake energy efficient upgrades of their rental properties, but their tenants do. At the same time, tenants are typically unable to upgrade, but their landlords are in a position to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Landlords are able to claim the cost of repairs made to their rental properties, e.g., repair parts of old inefficient air-conditioning units that <span style="font-style:italic;">do not meet today</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s minimum standards</span>, but are unable to claim appropriately for energy efficiency upgrades that would make a big difference to so many who are finding energy bills unaffordable.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That 'split-incentive' compounds vulnerability to energy poverty that is experienced all too often by people who rent. The Bill aims to address that disconnect more closely aligning the interests and benefits of landlords and renters.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, one of the recommendations of the 2017 Finkel Review into energy security was to improve access to energy efficiency programs for low income households. Recommendation 6.6 of that report encourages further review into "options for subsidised funding mechanisms for the supply of energy efficient appliances…for low income consumers." The Bill provides the perfect platform for such a review.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">For one thing, the overwhelming majority of Australians want governments to invest in energy efficiency measures. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In a survey by the Property Council of Australia of 1000 Australians in April this year, government investment in energy efficiency was the most popular energy policy option, with 88 per cent overall support. That figure crosses party lines, too, with support coming from 90 per cent Coalition and 89 per cent Labor voters.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The primary way people most vulnerable to energy poverty are currently supported is through concession schemes, which are typically administered by states and territories.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Consider the example given by the ACCC of Susan, a South Australian who was a full-time midwife until January this year when she needed to have surgery. Complications meant that Susan was forced to move to part-time work, and consequently began to develop an unavoidable electricity and gas debt of over $1000. Susan became at risk of disconnection as she could not meet her energy payments, notwithstanding existing energy concession schemes. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Existing concessions, including emergency energy payments and energy supplements, are well intentioned and positive. Ultimately, however, supplements are band-aid solutions to our energy affordability problem. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Current approaches to fixing the energy performance of our building stock focus on improving the standards of new buildings. Whilst commendable, we should not forget that only 2% of Australia's building stock is replaced each year, and many low income people rent old buildings. So, retrofitting is still critically important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, ensuring that retrofitting existing building stock has positive results can be a difficult exercise, especially for renters. Holistic performance assessment is important in order to take into account complexity in built environment, climate context, usage and comfort.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Fortunately, there are many successful examples that we could emulate. We already have a few federal, state and territory energy efficiency schemes, which this policy would complement. Most of those policies directly target occupiers of those properties, whereas the policy lever we are pulling in the Bill is to target landlords. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are also other examples of successful energy efficiency policies from outside Australia. For example, the US 'weatherization assistance programmes' have been highly positive, retrofitting low income properties with energy efficiency upgrades; the UK, through the 'Landlord's Energy Saving Allowance' (LESA), and New Zealand, through the 'Warm-Up New Zealand: Heat Smart programme'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The economic case for energy efficiency is also clear. Cost-benefit analysis of the New Zealand programme, for example, found that net benefits of their energy efficiency measures were evaluated to be <span style="font-style:italic;">4.8 times resource costs</span>. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Meaningful, long-term outcomes to lift people out of energy poverty will only be achieved by a holistic approach to energy policy that assesses demand as well as supply. It is that integrated approach that has the best potential to realistically provide affordability, sustainability and reliability. It is that approach I hope the Bill will encourage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Although the policy itself is deliberately designed to have modest take-up, the broader purpose is for the Bill to chart a way for Australia to transition towards more ambitious and transformative energy efficiency initiatives. In many ways, the Bill is a natural stepping stone to broader energy efficiency reforms that are sorely needed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, by enabling landlords to claim for energy efficiency assessments, the Bill could lead to further debate on whether a national energy efficiency assessment programme might be helpful. Specifically, we might consider whether introducing mandatory minimum standards simultaneously with mandatory disclosure at point of building lease and sale would ramp-up efforts at improving the quality of our building stock. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In much the same way as the Bill proposes, landlords would in those circumstances be able to claim tax offsets for energy efficiency improvements in the same financial year. That is because the spending required to make a property satisfy regulatory requirements would fall into the repairs classification.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Another hope I have for the Bill is to raise awareness of the impact that responsible energy efficiency initiatives can have for older people. I encourage the scheduled review of this policy after the trial period to consider the extent to which energy efficiency initiatives might be included in a national Older Persons Housing Strategy.</span>

In the Bill we have opted for a rental threshold of up to $300 per week to determine who is eligible, but there are other more sophisticated measures that assess low economic resources and housing stress, e.g., the '30-40 indicator'. </span>

                  </a>  I just say to the Labor Party and to all those people who have lost a loved one as a result of a drug overdose that to label support for International Overdose Awareness Day a stunt is absolutely disgraceful. When you consider that the number of drug-related deaths is now double the road toll, something needs to be done. All of the issues that we canvass in this motion, including ending the use of sniffer dogs at festivals and introducing pill testing at festivals, are based on evidence. We know that access to substitution therapies is expensive and that cost is a barrier to patients. We should have increased access to medically supervised injecting facilities. We know they work. It's about time that the Labor Party and the government understood what the evidence is actually telling us and started to show a bit of guts and stand up for people who are dying far too soon.</span>

                  </a>  Senator Hanson, you have company with some jail experience. I have the same objection that Senator Hanson has to that piece of the motion. Some of the motion is good and some of it's bad. When I was in jail, we were strip-searched every time we were going to meet visitors and we were strip-searched every time we came out. I think guards must be getting drugs to people in prison, because, when you're in a one-piece jumpsuit with a padlock on the back of your neck, there's no way known you can carry anything in there. They check inside your mouth to make sure it's not under your tongue. When I was under house arrest for five months, they came and knocked on the door at 10 o'clock at night to drug-test and alcohol-test me. Part of what you say, Senator Di Natale, is true, but on that angle I can't support it.</span>

In doing so, might I explain that the Labor Party's view is that the orders for the production of documents should be taken seriously and that the proposition as advanced provides for the minister to provide a proper explanation to the Senate as to why this has not been complied with and whether or not additional information can be provided that has not been provided to date, particularly given that the minister is representing a minister from the House of Representatives and that material has been provided to the financial review which hasn't been provided to the Senate. As a party of government, we don't support actions being taken as outlined in section (3) of this motion and we will be voting against it. We would ask that the government take note of that, because what comes around goes around in these circumstances. </span>

                    </a>  The Greens will be supporting this motion for an order for the production of documents. There is already too little transparency around defence spending in this country. In the last two years, we have seen from this government a record increase in defence expenditure since the Second World War. We've seen a new plan for Australia to become a top 10 global weapons exporter. To use a submarine analogy, it's not a good enough excuse for the Labor Party to come into this place in lock step with the Liberal Party under silent running, not being able to be scrutinised because you're going to be a party of government. That's the whole problem: being in lock step on national security when we're spending hundreds of billions of dollars on critical projects that the Australian people need information about. The more transparency the better, and we applaud Senator Patrick for bringing this motion forward today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="204953" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLACHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  I'm very happy to rise and make a contribution on this very important matter of public importance. It's an easy subject matter to speak about—relentless negativity and inability to focus on issues that Australians care about. This government is a textbook example of this, from day one—from their first budget, when they sought to rip and tear at the ability of working Australians, retired Australians, people in health and people enjoying reasonable standards in education and expecting a little bit more. They put in place the most horrendous budget. At the time, Senator the Hon. Joe Ludwig said to me, 'I've been here a fair while, and six weeks after a budget most people can't recall it. They will never forget this budget. This is the most horrific budget of all time. People will work it out in an eye blink, and they will deal with the people who passed it.' The Hon. Mathias Cormann—who gets a guernsey in almost all of the media these days as a really hardworking gentleman, the epitome of fairness and ability in the coalition—was there with his big glass of wine and his big fat cigar, music playing—<span style="font-style:italic;">Best Day of My Life</span>. When they copped the blowback that was necessarily coming from that horrendous budget, they thought: 'Well, it's easy. All we have to do is blame Labor. We need to pick out someone on the Labor Party side, keep chipping and hammering away, and try to blame Labor, because if we can distract the public, if we can distract the electorate, then perhaps we'll be able to sneak some of this appalling stuff through.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's just been a continual, relentless campaign of negativity. It ultimately ended up with Senator McGrath and others conspiring in the dead of night out at Narrabundah or perhaps even a bit further out, at Queanbeyan. They managed to concoct a plan which put paid to Prime Minister Abbott's career, and someone stumbled over the line of an election. We've gone—staggering, really—from pillar to post, with a government that has been unable to articulate a clear, concise, consistent policy to the electorate and gain support for it from all sectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got the Hon. Simon Birmingham in his role as education minister, who has left no-one offside. He has left no sector in education offside. He has picked a fight with every sector, and he has support from no sector, and he continues in that role. He continues to be a loyal supporter of the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, but the education sector is really a disaster area for the coalition. But then they go on to say Labor would be worse, as if that somehow can absolve them of their responsibility in education. The contender for Prime Minister today, the Hon. Peter Dutton, was voted as the worst health minister in 40 years. I struggle to remember 40 years back, to the minister who beat him as a worse health minister. But the answer is that it's Mr Shorten's fault. That's always the answer to a health problem or an education problem: 'It must be the Labor Party. They'll do you worse. Be under no illusion—as bad as we are, the Labor Party is worse.' I don't think it's cutting through any more. I have run a couple of campaigns, and I'm usually on the brighter side of things. I like to say what good work people do. But—and perhaps Senator the Hon. James McGrath will agree with this—people always get you to run negative. You can't win without a negative. This government runs negative every day, and it is appalling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate is saying: 'What is going on? We are blessed with natural resources in coal, gas and hydro. Why can't we get something done about the electricity prices?' What is the answer over there? They say, 'NEG.' We should probably should say 'negative'—'Negative, negative, negative.' Then they end up throwing the policy out the window. The Prime Minister goes from saying, 'I have total support in the party room,' to throwing the policy out the window—and probably throwing his minister out with it. You'd have to say that some people do work diligently in their portfolios. They get consensus. They get the Chief Scientist and other experts to come together with a plan—but, politically, they couldn't sell it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The answer in the chamber is, 'Labor will be worse.' Well, you've got to realise you've been in government long enough now to start owning your policies and your actions, and you have to take responsibility for them. If you've lost 38 polls and you're going to lose 42, the electorate is telling you something. Relentless negativity about your opponents—who don't have the power, by the way—is not gaining you a vote. We don't have the power. You are the government. They are your decisions. You must own them, and you cannot defend bad decisions and bad policy by blaming your opposition. But you—this government—seem to think that that's the way forward. Well, keep going, because it's working for us. The electorate is seeing through it. You have been in power long enough to own your decisions in education and in health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If there's stagnant wage growth in the economy, I know—the solution must be that we haven't cut taxes enough for big companies and banks! If people can't get a decent wage increase and they're struggling to pay their electricity bills—the solution is that big banks need a tax cut! I note the appalling hypocrisy of the Hon. Kelly O'Dwyer, who voted against the banking royal commission, railed against it, said it was all the fault of industry super funds—and then, the other day, came out and started giving the banks a bit of a shove and a bit of a kicking in the media. She said there was appalling behaviour. She used to work for a bank, so she probably knew all about it before the royal commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's amazing that the government continues—like a dog returning to its vomit—on the same path of destruction. But keep doing it, because we're going reasonably well. The polls are looking pretty good for us. Keep going with the debacle you've got going on now. Keep it going right through to September. Actually, I hope you keep it going through to May next year. By then, it'll be 60-40 in the Newspolls—that's if you've still got the National Party in the coalition; they're threatening to join the crossbenches. This relentless negativity and inability to deliver for working Australians, whether it's small business or working families, is amazing, but keep doing it. You're led by a bloke that seems to have the Midas touch in making the wrong call. Whenever there is an opportunity to make a good decision, to show a bit of fortitude, to stand up as a Prime Minister and take some people on, he always folds. I'm not just guessing that. If you go back through Prime Minister Turnbull's history, you will see he has gone the wrong way every time. It has also been, 'If only we could have a plan for diminution of the Leader of the Opposition, if only we could have a plan that makes the Leader of the Opposition look bad, then, somehow or other, our fortunes will revive.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator the Hon. Michaelia Cash: 'If only I could nail the CFMEU and get them on something.' I walked around Melbourne the other morning and the place was buzzing. Building sites are overflowing with people working and they enjoy good wage and conditions—safe conditions. I didn't see any of the untoward activity the Hon. Michaelia Cash rails about, as if somehow a contribution in the Senate castigating a section of the union community is going to improve their vote. It doesn't work like that. Most working Australians look at unions as being fair play, fair wages and good access—everybody goes up with the rising tide. If $100 billion is invested in infrastructure in Victoria, people should get a lift out of that, and they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But when we come back into the chamber here there is this negativity. I hope you keep going with it, I really do, because it is working for us. After years of government, you can't blame the sins of all of your actions on the opposition. You have to own your own disruption, and that's where you're going. The real question is not who'll be Prime Minister in a month, or six weeks, or two weeks time. The real question is: in the coming election, how many of you will get tossed out and lose your seat in the Senate? You haven't captured government. You've focused on the opposition and haven't played the ball. You haven't been able to articulate your successes. Prime Minister Turnbull's period will go unremarked in history—no great progress, no great plan. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:17</span>):  I'm not sure my friend Senator Gallacher meant to pay compliments to the government, but indeed he did. Perhaps I could just reflect on the part of his contribution where he said he had been downtown and the worksites were buzzing, with people working everywhere. He talked about a $100 billion investment in infrastructure in Victoria. Well, how does Senator Gallacher think that has come about? That's an endorsement of the efforts of this government. If you want to just rewind and go back to under Labor, if you want to talk about employment opportunities and sites buzzing, unemployment increased by 39 per cent under the former Labor government—39 per cent! In their last year in office, unemployment rose by 33,000 people. So, there wouldn't have been things buzzing down in downtown Canberra. Things wouldn't be buzzing and we wouldn't see cranes on the horizon in Victoria under a government that, of course, was crippled, and crippled us, with massive intergenerational debt. The reason the sites were buzzing and the reason we can do $100 billion of investment in Victoria alone, and that's just one state, is that this government, with its focus and its resolve, has increased jobs—over one million jobs: 1,086,806 at the time of the briefing, in less than five years. Compare the two: a 39 per cent reduction in employment versus over one million jobs having been created under this government. Let's do a comparison: since September 2015, a total of 770,000 new jobs have been created, more than half of them full-time jobs—410,000. That's why the sites in the middle of Canberra are buzzing. That's why you're able to do $100 billion of projects in Victoria. That money has come largely from the efforts of this federal government as it has distributed the wealth of the nation to the best it can in very, very difficult economic circumstances. In Labor's last year in office, unemployment rose by 33,000. That compares with new employment of 10 times that, just in the last 12 months—339,000 new jobs. Many of those employment opportunities have been created for those people who have relied for so long upon the Australian Labor Party to be their champion and to provide an environment where they can, with confidence, all get some work.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My interest has always been, and remains, in the areas of agriculture and what I call provincial Australia. Not only did we inherit a debt but we inherited a decision by the Australian Labor Party to cease the live cattle trade to Indonesia. I know you're tired of hearing me talk about this, but the impacts of that decision are still playing through the balance sheets of so many tens of thousands of family farms and enterprises around the country. It drove hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of head of cattle that were destined for overseas markets onto the domestic market—and, of course, it drove the commodity price for beef down as low as it's been for some 30 years, pound for pound. Then came the drought. Many of our people in provincial Australia would have been in a more resilient position to be able to deal with these long periods of dry—we've had 19 of them now, with 11 major droughts since we've kept records, I think, in the 1860s—but, of course, they weren't. The cupboard was bare because they'd been selling cattle, in some instances for as low as 58c per kilogram, which, if the drought were to break today, they'd have to pay $2.80 or $2.85 per kilogram to replace. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those were the circumstances that we were left with, but what did we do? We supported that sector. We supported that sector well during that time. The government gave out almost $2 billion as part of our drought program. We created the RIC, which was supported here in this place, even though the Labor Party resisted it for a long period of time. There's $2 billion in that fund for water projects across the country, for local authorities and state governments to be able to apply for support to put in water infrastructure in those areas, which will make our provincial people far more resilient. We set aside $5 billion for the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, the NAIF, to provide opportunities for developing the vast expanses of northern Australia and provide finance for infrastructure projects up and down the eastern and western seaboard, north of the Tropic of Capricorn. Five minutes doesn't allow me to cover everything. There was an earlier motion like this about 12 months ago. We were given speaking notes—82 pages of single-line achievements, both financial and policy adjustments, for this country. </span>

At least we get out there and have a good old tussle-up as we try and sort out what we're going to do. But, can I say to you, I've been proud to serve in this parliament, and for 4½ years in this government—the Turnbull government, and, before that, the Abbott government—because of what we've delivered for provincial and regional Australia. It's massive. It's better. Those places are better. Those communities, those economies are better and stronger as a result of the efforts of this government. I've got to tell you: they want to lecture us on our inability to focus on issues that Australians care about—well, they need to go back and have a look at the report card.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARUQI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  The Turnbull government's relentless negativity and inability to focus on the issues that Australians care about has not come about because of the dysfunction of the last three days; it has been a hallmark throughout their time in government. No matter who takes the helm of the Liberal-National government, their policies will continue to wreak havoc on the Australian people. Their destructive agenda is one of a government that works for the big end of town at the expense of its people and the environment. It is a government that was in here just a few hours ago desperately trying to cut deals and appease big business with corporate tax cuts, and then the Prime Minister backtracked, focused entirely on trying to stay in power, but not until he had tried every tactic to pass his absurd handout to his corporate mates, which would have left millions of Australians worse off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a rich country like ours many are forced to live in poverty while the government puts the largest corporations and their profits before people. This is quite unbelievable. It is shameful that the government is out there indulging in political theatre while millions are barely making ends meet. The Australian Council of Social Service estimates that over 13 per cent of all Australians are living below the internationally accepted poverty line. That's a staggering 2.9 million people. We have a homelessness crisis in our country. Homelessness has jumped 14 per cent just in the five years between 2011 and 2016. Over 100,000 people have no permanent home right now. The Turnbull government should be focusing on what successive governments have failed to commit to—building more social housing and more affordable homes—but there is no serious political will to help those who need it most, those who don't have a roof over their heads and those who are standing at the brink of poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A hundred per cent of my home state, New South Wales, is covered by drought. Farmers, regional Australians, our environment and our native animals all suffer while the Liberal Party indulges those who refuse to even accept that climate change is happening. They haven't delivered for regional Australia or, in fact, anywhere else in Australia. It is the narrow self-interest and the desperate desire to stay in power that has led to a system which fails, time and again, to find solutions to real problems and create policy that responds to the needs of people. Mr Turnbull and his colleagues haven't quite grasped that governments are there to serve the people, not themselves. Our challenges are many, and there is nothing more fundamentally important than facing these head-on and restoring public trust.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we stand here 120 children are locked up on Nauru. Some of them have completely lost hope of ever leaving that tiny island in the Pacific and having a normal life. Make no mistake: these children have been imprisoned by the Australian government with the full support of the Labor Party. A 12-year-old boy has been on a hunger strike for over two weeks. Let that sink in for a moment. The children on Nauru are not referred to by their names; they have numbers instead. Some of them were born on Nauru and have never known a life outside the barbed wire of the island prison the Australian government has established for them. They are living in terrible conditions, in mouldy tents, with no access to proper medical care. There have been reports of suicide attempts by children on Nauru. This is something we would never accept for our own children, so why do we accept it for these children who are most in need? The community outside of this chamber and the hallways of Parliament House doesn't care about political theatre; it cares about the issues that matter, the issues that are life-changing, and where we can do so much better.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:28</span>):  A government that is tearing itself apart cannot be focused on the issues that Australians care about. We know that this Prime Minister is hanging on by a thread. It appears inevitable that, whether tomorrow or in a couple of weeks time, Mr Dutton will become Prime Minister of this country. Before I go any further with my contribution, I want to comment on Senator O'Sullivan's rather unenthusiastic defence of the government's record in relation to this matter. This government is focused on negativity. It has always been the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you go back to the 2014 budget—that disaster of a budget!—we heard the rhetoric of the so-called budget emergency. And today I heard Senator O'Sullivan talk about the fact that they were focused on debt, and they thought that they were going to do a better job than the preceding Labor government, but what have we seen? We've seen debt crash through the half-a-trillion-dollar figure. This is a government that has failed on its own metrics. It's failed in terms of its own goalposts. So let's not hear anything about the achievements of this government, because there is very little to be said about the achievements of the Abbott-Turnbull government. One of the critical things that I think the average Australian is concerned about is the demise of manufacturing in this country, including the demise of the car industry. That is an aspect of this government's record that will go down in the history books.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast between the government and the opposition could not be any more stark at the present time. You have a government that's focused on negativity and tearing itself apart. On this side of the chamber, we have an opposition which is united and ready for government and has been putting out positive policies for some years now. And I'm so proud of the leadership of the federal Labor opposition for not making itself a small target but being bold when it comes to policy development and making some of the difficult decisions up-front so that the electorate is well aware of those before going to an election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people would not be aware that my electorate office is located in the electorate of Dickson. I bump into the member for Dickson every now and then, and I think I'm fairly well placed to observe what's been happening in his electorate over a number of years. I just want to take a few minutes to talk about his record. I think it's worth bringing to mind that, in 2009, Mr Dutton sought to dump his own marginal electorate of Dickson following a redistribution and jump into what he thought would be the safer seat of McPherson on the Gold Coast. He was unsuccessful on that occasion; the Gold Coast members of the Liberal Party chose to support Ms Andrews. I take it that she must have forgiven Mr Dutton, because I understand that she voted for him yesterday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the issue of health, as has been said previously, in 2015, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Doctor</span> magazine, Mr Dutton was overwhelmingly voted the worst health minister in living memory. That's quite an achievement. He also set up the Medicare privatisation task force. The privatisation of Medicare was the brainchild of Mr Dutton, who got the ball rolling to set up the privatisation through the digital space. He was the health minister who froze the Medicare rebate, and he cut dental funding. Currently, Mr Dutton is supporting $17 billion being ripped out of Australian schools, including around $2 billion from Catholic schools and, in his own electorate of Dickson, taking $13 million out of local school budgets. Mr Dutton supported the measures to freeze funding to universities—measures that jeopardised the future of the new University of the Sunshine Coast Moreton Bay campus. And I want to take the opportunity to again contrast the government's approach to that of the opposition. We've said that we will invest more than $120 million in the University of the Sunshine Coast's new Moreton Bay campus, which is being built at the moment and which would transform the Moreton Bay region into a high-tech education hub—long overdue on the north side of Brisbane.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's painfully clear from the record of Mr Dutton that he is bad for health, he is bad for education, he is bad for Dickson and he will be worse for Australia. The people of Australia deserve better. Again, I want to contrast that with what is happening on our side. We have been working hard with Labor's fantastic candidate for the seat of Dickson, Ali France, to make sure that we dump Mr Dutton. Ali has been working hard since her preselection. She has knocked on countless doors, talking to local businesses and meeting with struggling workers and families. As an amputee, Ali is a passionate and tireless advocate for the disability sector. She has had the courage to speak out against Mr Dutton on immigration issues, on cuts to health and education, and on the botched delivery of the NBN. Together, Ali, Corinne Mulholland—our candidate in the neighbouring electorate of Petrie—and I have been out there holding the government to account on their failures. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I’m talking about Petrie, we can look at the representation there and at the record of the current member, Mr Howarth, who stayed quiet while his government prioritised banks over schools. He stayed quiet while his government prioritised big business over hospitals. He said nothing about the cuts to penalty rates. He said nothing about how energy prices and poor internet access have been hurting small businesses and households in his electorate. I know that these issues have been biting in the electorate of Petrie, because I have been there, with Corinne Mulholland, talking to businesses, workers and families—in both Petrie and Dickson. We've had mobile offices and held NBN forums and business round tables. I note that Mr Howarth did find his voice recently and spoke out against his own party's company tax cuts. He indicated that he wasn't in support of those being taken forward. Today, the Senate has voted no to the company tax cuts, and I'm proud that I was here to play a part in that. I suspect that Mr Howarth is also pretty happy about that, too. We see that he has also supported Mr Dutton in the leadership challenge. This is despite Mr Howarth saying in April that he wouldn't support a further leadership challenge. It appears that loyalty is dead in the Liberal Party, and that no-one can be taken at their word. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to reiterate a call today from our leader, Mr Shorten: while this government is tearing itself apart, while it is being motivated by self-preservation, suspicion, malice, revenge, personal ambition and fear—while it's engaged in all of that, it should hit the pause button. Out of respect for the people of Australia, it should pause any decisions which are intended to bind an incoming government, in line with caretaker provisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are sick of the shenanigans. They're sick of the negativity. They're sick of having the national interest come after the self-interest of Liberal-National Party politicians who are just out there to save their jobs. It's time for some positive politics. While the Liberals and Nationals are focusing on negativity and getting nothing done, we on our side of politics are out there, as I've said, listening, and developing good policies—fair policies. We've already announced 150 policies. Time doesn't allow me to go through those. But, unlike those opposite, we know how our policies will be funded. We've been up-front and transparent. It's time for a Labor government to restore stability to government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:38</span>):  I rise today to speak on this matter of public importance introduced to this place by our parliamentary colleague from the Australian Labor Party, Senator Collins. What an extraordinary joy and a privilege it is to be able to speak on this matter of public importance: the government's apparently relentless negativity and inability to focus on issues that Australians care about. I take personal offence at this one. Frankly, I still come to work every day with a pep in my step and a glide in my stride. If you're going to find relentless negativity anywhere, it's going to be on that side of the chamber, not on this side of the chamber. In fact, I would go so far as to say that relentless negativity starts with Senator Collins herself. Little Miss Sunshine of the Labor Party—doesn't she just add a little sparkle and glamour to every single day—comes in here and accuses us of negativity! How extraordinary. We heard from Senator Gallacher. Wasn't that a lovely 10 minutes? Gosh! It felt like it was so much longer. Senator Gallacher is a man who has all the gravitas of a personalised licence plate. Then we heard from Senator Faruqi, our newest senator, from the Greens. I had such high hopes for Senator Faruqi. However, sadly, just like her colleague Senator Whish-Wilson, she is forever trapped in a first-year Arts student mentality. But that's all right. Don't worry about that. She'll grow up at some stage, we hope.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams. You're absolutely right. What I will now do is talk specifically to this matter of public importance, something which I take personal offence to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is it that makes people happy, what is it that makes people positive, in politics? Let me tell you what I think it is. I think that what makes people happy, what makes people positive, in politics is when their government delivers on its promises. And I make no bones about it: delivering on political promises is not easy. In fact, I have heard it said that political promises are a little bit like babies: they're very fun to make but hell to deliver. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator HUME:</span>
                  </a>  I knew you'd like that one! So let's talk about what this government is actually delivering for the people of Australia, in a positive light. This government has been working hard for hardworking Australians. The coalition has delivered in areas which are important to Australia but forgotten by those opposite. Let's talk about the positivity of company tax cuts for companies with a turnover of under $50 million. That covers 3.2 million businesses, and they employ 6.7 million Australians. I think that's something that we can be extraordinarily positive about. What about positive things like $75 billion in infrastructure over the next decade—things like highway upgrades, congestion-busting road and rail projects, improved local roads, inland rail and, of course, a new airport and a new airport link in my home state of Victoria, in my home town of Melbourne? How about positive things like reducing growth in government spending? Let's recall that government spending increased year on year by more than four per cent under Labor. Under this government, it's now actually growing at a slower rate that it has in more than a quarter of a century—1.9 per cent. And we are returning the budget to surplus a year earlier than anticipated. Now, I think that's a very positive news story. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How about the positive news story of returning the rule of law to workplaces by restoring the ABCC and by the introduction of the Registered Organisations Commission? I can understand why that would potentially not be a positive news story for those opposite, but it is over here, and it is for anybody who has a child, a son or a daughter, who works on construction sites. They know now that their child won't be coerced, they won't be bullied, but they will be looked after and their employers can continue to employ them. I think that that's a very positive news story for the individuals who work on construction sites—an end to union lawlessness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about positive things like an increase in school funding of $23.5 billion over a decade, a 50 per cent increase for the average student? What about health spending, with record bulk-billing levels and new drugs appearing on the PBS almost weekly at this stage—life-saving medicines changing people's lives? I reckon that's a pretty positive news story. What about a million new jobs? I don't think you could get any more positive than that. Of that million, 400,000 were in the last 12 months alone, and the vast majority of those were full-time and the vast majority of those went to women. How about higher participation rates for women than ever before?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think these are extraordinarily good news stories. I would suggest that, over there on 'planet Labor', they may think that these things are relentlessly negative, but that's because they have a pathological discontent. They don't really care what matters to Australians. They care what matters to Labor. They care what happens to their union mates. That's what matters to them. That's why the coalition is truly delivering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about what people do find negative. I think that people find two things negative: death and taxes. Yet I've heard on the grapevine that that's exactly what Labor have in mind. I think the real issue of public importance today is Labor's death tax. I read—and tell me if I'm wrong—that the ACTU has, as one of its policy platforms, an inheritance tax. Have I been fooled? Is this new? I was astounded. I thought that Labor's death tax was abolished more than 40 years ago, but it seems to have raised its ugly head once again. Let's have a closer look at this. I want to draw the chamber's attention to a remark that was in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>just last month. It quoted from the ACTU's policy platform. It was buried in the policy document, but it did say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Consideration should be given to taxing inheritances in the hands of the beneficiary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A lifetime threshold could be made available to the taxpayer with tax payable once cumulative inheritances exceeded the threshold.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, yes—it is, in fact, the usual story: Bill Shorten will deny that Labor have a plan to whack a death tax on the elderly, the same way that Julia Gillard denied that there would be a carbon tax under the government she led. You've got to admire the shamelessness, the pathological discontent of a party that would do this to the population. I mean, it's not bright—don't get me wrong—but it is certainly audacious. It is an audacious and mean-spirited attack on the savings of those who have worked so hard. It is quite remarkable. I know that your union mates over there would happily see the savings of those who work hard—who do the right thing by others and who create jobs—confiscated by a government hell-bent on taxing and spending as the economy increasingly slows down. The death tax goes to the heart of the politics of envy that Labor are all about. Their union mates are actually designing policy to kill the concept of the family business. But why are we surprised? They've been trying to kill business for much longer than that. This is the most anti-business, anti-growth, anti-jobs opposition we have ever seen—I'd like to say since Whitlam, but I think that that's an insult to Whitlam.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at some of the taxes that they've already announced: a housing tax, a $20 billion tax on mum-and-dad investors through their plan to abolish negative gearing for established homes; an investment tax, a $13 billion tax increase on capital gains for all assets, increasing the rate by 50 per cent—I think we're going through some of the 120,000 policies that Senator Ketter has mentioned; their tax return tax, the $3,000 cap on individuals—they're going to get $1.5 billion from that one, apparently; a family business tax, $22 billion on family business trusts—heaven help us; the tradie tax, making changes to tax deductibility for 800,000 self-employed people; and, of course, their growth tax, because they will repeal the company tax cuts that have already gone through. Shame on them and their relentless negativity. If they want higher taxes, if they want to have— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  Today in the chamber, and today in all the halls of this parliament, our nation is, indeed, beset with the relentless negativity and dysfunction of our coalition government. We appear to have a government that has simply stopped governing, overtaken by division and chaos. But the division and chaos we see is, in large part, the symptom—and not the cause—of much, much, much deeper problems inside the coalition, problems which wreak a heavy cost on the Australian public and on the Australian nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's drill down to see why we find ourselves in this situation. It's not just chaos and dysfunction. There's an absolute, fundamental, ideological divide inside the coalition that makes it simply impossible for them to find consensus and to govern. If we look very carefully at energy bills, which are skyrocketing in our nation, we have from this government a supposed plan that has been changed any number of times. Make no mistake: the ideological division, the chaos and the dysfunction in the Liberal Party mean Australians will now pay even more on their power bills. The policy uncertainty, the tussling between Turnbull, Abbott and Dutton over many years now simply mean power bills in our nation going up and up. This nation has forgone billions of dollars of investment in energy, both renewable and non-renewable, simply because the government have failed to put any policy settings in place—policy settings to deal with our electricity market, to deal with the role of renewables, or to look reasonably at our international agreements. Whether you agree with the directions or the ideas behind any of those elements is one thing. But the real nub of this problem and this issue is the need—whether you're a fossil-fuel or renewable energy generator—for policy certainty. This question has been done and undone by those opposite, over and over again. This means that, because of the Liberal Party, Australians will pay more on their power bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's approach to the NEG has been farcical. With the so-called National Energy Guarantee—or the national energy grid—the kind of conduct they've been up to includes things like cancelling Labor's briefing on this policy without even bothering to reschedule it. Now we can't even get access to the legislation. We were called on to provide bipartisan support, to make progress on these critical issues, but they would have needed to actually talk to us about their policy approaches. Who knows what the government's policy approach is? The draft legislation we've seen already seems to be obsolete. Why? Because of the division and chaos inside the coalition. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull dropped the emissions reductions target from being legislated in parliament. Why did he do this? He said it was because he didn't have the numbers. The government won't show us the legislation. Without seeing the legislation, it's hard for us to say whether we would be prepared to support it. Because of the chaos and dysfunction that completely preoccupies this government, we can't make progress on these critical issues to serve the best interests of electricity consumers in our nation.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  It's a pleasure to join this debate, particularly after that very fine speech by my colleague Senator Hume. I must say that it was one of the best, most accurate and most perceptive speeches that I've heard for some time—certainly, that I've heard in this debate while I've been in the chamber. Senate Hume has quite rightly had a serious look at this proposed matter of public importance—which, I must say, most people don't ever look terribly closely at. It is proposed by the Labor Party that the matter of public importance is:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Turnbull Government's relentless negativity and inability to focus on the issues Australians care about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a proposed matter that is trite, inaccurate and dishonest—but, coming from the Labor Party, what else would you expect? That really describes the Labor Party: trite, inaccurate and dishonest. As Senator Hume so nicely pointed out, the negativity one sees in this Parliament House comes only from the opposition benches. I challenge anyone to say when they've ever heard the Labor Party say a positive thing. At question time, in speeches, it's always, 'Nag, nag, nag; debate, debate, debate.' Contrary, antagonistic—it's anything but positivity. The positivity in this chamber comes from the government. Senator Hume has so clearly set out examples of the positive actions of this government and the negativity of the Labor Party and their mates in the Greens political party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've said what a fine speech it was from Senator Hume, but she was wrong in one case. She accuses the Labor Party of wanting to bring back death taxes. I see some of the Labor Party's backers, the unions, are calling for that, but that is the Labor Party yet again adopting the Greens political party's policy. The Greens unashamedly want death taxes back. It seems now the Labor Party are, as usual, dancing to the Greens' tune, because the Greens give them preferences. The Greens run with their front, GetUp!, only to keep the Labor Party in power.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator IAN MACDONALD:</span>
                  </a>  Sorry, Senator Siewert's laughing about that. Do you say that's inaccurate? In my state of Queensland the Greens exist just to keep the Labor Party in power. In Senator Whish-Wilson's state of Tasmania they went even further than that; they joined in coalition government with them until the people of Tasmania got a bit sick of the Greens and the Labor Party and booted them all out. The Greens were lucky to win one seat at the last election in Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to the import of this matter of public importance, the government is full of positivity and good things for the Australian people, like over a million jobs that have been created by coalition governments in less than five years. That's not bad; that's pretty positive. How could the Labor Party even suggest that was negative? There are 770,000 new jobs that have been created since September 2015, more than half of which are full-time. These are jobs that people didn't have under the Labor Party. Almost 340,000 new jobs were created in just the last 12 months. There has been record jobs growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been business tax cuts for small and medium-sized businesses, a very positive initiative of the Turnbull government. Strengthening small to medium-sized businesses means more jobs for our fellow Australians. Childcare reforms by the Turnbull government are benefiting a million families. Those new initiatives started in July, meaning more families are able to access affordable and reliable child care, enabling the parents to go to work. How positive is that? Where is the negativity that this particular motion seems to suggest?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've turned the corner on energy prices. A lot of work has been done by Mr Frydenberg, the energy minister, in getting together this national energy policy, and it's a pity the Labor Party are so negative that apparently they want to keep the electricity prices high. I understand why that happens in Queensland. The electricity company in Queensland that generates and sells the power in Queensland—and gouges businesses and residents alike—is owned by the Queensland government. It makes huge profits, which the electricity company then just channels into the Queensland Labor government, a government that's bereft of any financial expertise. They try to stay afloat by gouging money out of electricity consumers through their wholly owned electricity company, so I can understand why Labor's opposed to the Turnbull government's initiatives to keep electricity affordable and reliable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Trans-Pacific Partnership is yet another in a long list of free trade agreements that the Turnbull government has been able to achieve. They're not just international treaties that someone has signed and that's it; they actually mean something. I will just briefly mention two aspects of the Trans-Pacific Partnership that are so appealing to me, and they are beef and sugar, which are major exports from up in North Queensland, where I come from. Regrettably, Senator Watt wouldn't know where that is. He knocked off the only Labor senator in North Queensland, and, of course, the Labor Party now have no senators north of Brisbane. Senator Watt got rid of the one they had, and I understand he's going to put in one of his Brisbane staffers and pretend they're the northern senator.</span>

                  </a>  That TPP is great news for the beef and sugar industries, and the benefits of that are just magnificent. Unfortunately, time doesn't permit me to go through all the positives of the Turnbull government, which show that this proposal by the Labor Party in this matter of public importance is just as I said it was originally: very trite, very inaccurate and very dishonest, just like the party that proposed it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:01</span>):  This matter of public importance is about the Turnbull government's relentless negativity and inability to focus on the issues Australians care about. Well, I can tell you that what Australians care about is immigration, water, farming, the sale of land and assets to foreign owners, the cost of living and jobs. That is what's on top of the list for Australians and what they care about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hopefully, I'm going to put a balanced view here. Of course, you're going to get the Labor Party, who want to be government, criticising the government without giving any credit where credit is due. And, of course, the government are going to stand up for themselves. I am in this place as an Independent and I voice the concerns of many Australians. I haven't been happy with the government's response in a lot of areas, but a lot of the time I have voted with the government on their legislation. They are the government; they put up the legislation, not the Labor Party. In two years I haven't seen any piece of legislation from the Labor Party put on the floor of this parliament for me to vote on. I actually look at the government's legislation based on its merit and what I think is best for this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I am concerned about with the government is that they haven't taken any notice of the Callaghan report. This is very important to the people, because we are looking at the North West Shelf and the gas we have there. We need it. I've been talking about it, and I'll keep talking about it. The Callaghan report was handed down in April 2017. Not one recommendation of the Callaghan report has been implemented, including changing the gas transfer price mechanism, which would bring in $1 billion a year. Yet sales of our gas are now going up further from $35 billion, with another $22 billion expected this year, and no extra money is coming into the country. I'm concerned about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been too little done too late for the farming sector. We have farmers on their knees, actually having to cull or kill their livestock because they're dying from the drought. We have not seen a major dam built in this country since 2012. Water is everything. Water gives life to this country. Yet we see foreign aid going to other countries around the world. We are worried about them but we don't look after our own. Until we start building more dams and actually watering this country, we will not see farmers stay on their properties. They can't deal with it anymore. As I said, it's too little too late. Deal with the water issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have also been the energy providers. We've allowed integrated energy providers, who produce and sell electricity, to gouge their customers. Labor is having a go at the government over this, about the emissions trading scheme. The government's emissions trading scheme is at—what, 26 per cent? Labor wants it at 45 to 50 per cent. I tell you what, you wouldn't be able to keep the electricity prices down either. They'd soar under you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go back to what the government has supported, the deal with the Australian building and construction industry, which they reined in. It gave the developers, the builders, the opportunity to go ahead without being controlled, run, dictated to and bullied by the unions. They have done that. They have created more jobs. They've reined in the childcare reforms. They've brought in the code of conduct for the canegrowers, which is great. They allowed the Defence contracts—not just for big business, but now the smaller businesses can tender for Defence Force contracts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me remind Labor what they did. What about the pink batts? Wasn't that a debacle under Labor? What about your high immigration—over 300,000 per year. Let's talk about the run-up of your debt, from $50 billion to $270 billion, when you were in. What about the waste on the Building the Education Revolution—billions of dollars for sheds? That was another thing under Labor. What about the free digital boxes for pensioners and TVs that didn't even work? And you just decimated the TAFEs, and you haven't rebuilt apprenticeships. So, Labor, stop throwing, because you have actually destroyed this country as well. You've got nothing to crow about. It concerns me. You talk about leadership challenges. A couple of months ago, wasn't Albanese going to challenge Bill Shorten? Weren't you worried about that? Talk about dysfunction. Look inside your own party.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report is a long-awaited review of the act, the implementation of the act and what's commonly called the ACNC—the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. It's a long-anticipated review. I note that they have made 30 recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go back to a little bit of history first-up. This was a commission that the previous Labor government put in place that had strong support across the charities and not-for-profits. There were a couple that didn't support it but having been very involved in and, in fact, negotiating some changes to the bills at the time, to ensure that there are better protections for charities and the not-for-profit sector, it was strongly supported by the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it was opposed by the then opposition, the now current government. When the then opposition came into government, they sought for quite a long time to get rid of the ACNC. The not-for-profit and charities sector fought back very strongly, as did ourselves, and, of course, the opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to point out that in the report, the review panel say, 'There is strong support for the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission and its accomplishments in the first five years, with the sector acknowledging the collaborative and educative approach taken by the ACNC'. They consider that this approach will continue and there is an opportunity to broaden the use of incentives to encourage good behaviour. They make, as I said, a number of recommendations. Among the recommendations and conclusions, there's a common theme for a national scheme for the sector, including the referral of powers from the states to the Commonwealth. That's about fundraising. This issue has been causing ongoing tensions. Of course, with the ACNC and the issues around fundraising power and regulatory capacity, the states still haven't come on board, nearly six years down the track. There hasn't been a full referral of powers. That causes unending concern and obstacles for charities and the not-for-profit sector across Australia. So they do make recommendations on the need for referral. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Others talk about giving the ACCC responsibility with regard to charities and fundraising. I have quite a bit of sympathy for that, because, at the moment, regulation of the sector is a hotchpotch across Australia. If you're a charity working across the different states, you have to comply with multiple rules and approaches. So, while I have sympathy for that and have in fact spoken to people working in this space for quite a long time about it, I would suggest that a staged approach be taken to full referrals or concurrent referrals of powers around fundraising. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to some of the other issues. Anyone who knows me and the work that I have been doing in this chamber over the years would know that it is around the role that charities and the not-for-profits sector play in civil society and the role of advocacy. I will quickly note that the panel supports the role of charities to 'promote or oppose a change to any matter of law, policy or practice' that is linked to their charitable purpose. There are a number of recommendations around that, but I want to point out that strong note there around advocacy. They also cover issues on basic religious charities and make some recommendations, which I urge people to look at. I think there needs to be some changes there, which they talk about. If nobody else wants to speak on this report, I seek leave to continue my remarks. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time available, I want to highlight a few key parts of the Climate Change Authority's <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of the National Wind Farm Commissioner</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>report, dated May 2018. This was a review the government promised they would do when they first established the Wind Farm Commissioner, and this is the result of that review. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report notes the rapid expansion of the wind industry in Australia as a key component of the growing renewable energy industry in Australia and a key component in assisting to deliver into the future not just cleaner energy but cheaper energy than the energy generation methods of the past, particularly coal, which is not only dirty but also expensive. The number and size of wind farms in Australia has grown rapidly. According to this report, there are currently around 78 wind farms in Australia, with at least another 21 proposed, which will increase wind farm capacity by almost two-thirds when they are completed. Wind farms are in all states in Australia. They are particularly concentrated in the south-eastern corner of the continent—South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales, but also in other states. I saw quite a sizable new wind farm development going up on the Atherton Tablelands when I was up there just a few weeks ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also notes that new development associated with the renewable energy target is likely to be significant over the next few years in the wind industry but also with large-scale solar and storage developments, such as large-scale batteries. This is being driven not just by the Commonwealth renewable energy target but also by the policy of some state governments in actively promoting greater investment in renewable energy. This is also, of course, generating jobs, many of them in regional and rural parts of the country—both construction jobs and ongoing maintenance jobs. This also highlights, I should say, a development driven by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, a key achievement that Greens were able to deliver. That has delivered cheaper, cleaner power and also significant numbers of jobs around the country in regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This commitment to strengthening renewable energy is all the more critical and, at least while this government stays in power, it puts a significant onus on state governments to pick up the slack and not only fill the void but counter the vandalism that's happened at national level, with this government's disgraceful tearing to pieces of what was world's best practice when it came to a carbon-pricing regime. Of course, as we all know, the government replaced it with nothing but their own incoherent internal ideological confusion. There was no coherent energy policy at all from this government, other than to destroy one that not only was actually delivering a significant reduction in emissions but also, over time, would have delivered cheaper power because of the expansion of renewable energy. So because of the chaos in the energy-pricing policies of this government, acting in the interests of its corporate donors, the mining sector and its mates in the coal industry and putting the community last, it is all the more crucial that there be a continuing commitment and a continuing push for expansion in investment in renewable energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report by the Climate Change Authority acknowledges that, even under existing policy settings that this government hasn't been able to vandalise, there will continue to be significant expansion in renewable energy projects in the near future. But the Greens are calling for that to be turbocharged, because there is an ability to increase and improve the renewable energy targets well above not just what is being put forward by this government but what Labor is putting forward as well, which is certainly better than what the coalition are doing but is not as high as what is definitely achievable and doable. Renewable energy projects deliver significant jobs and reliable power. They deliver, obviously, not just cleaner energy but cheaper energy over time. So monitoring of those projects—because there will be more and more of them—is a good approach, but the key thing is to ensure that that investment in renewable energy not only continues but grows further.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to highlight one of the bills in respect of which the committee is seeking additional information: the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. As set out in the report, the bill promotes multiple human rights, including the right to freedom from slavery and forced labour, by requiring certain entities to prepare annual statements on actions to address modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains. The report notes that, while Australia has a number of measures in place that prohibit slavery and related practices, the measures introduced by the bill address a gap in Australia's capacity to identify, investigate and respond to instances of modern slavery. These proposed reporting requirements are therefore to be welcomed from a human rights perspective. In order to complete its technical assessment against Australia's international human rights law obligations, the committee has also requested some further information as to the compatibility of an aspect of the measures with the right to privacy. </span>

While the committee's reports are available on its website, it is very welcome that these reports are now accessible, in searchable form, as part of AustLII's broad range of online legal materials. I trust that this database will be a valuable resource for all those interested in the committee's work and I thank AustLII for including the committee's reports in their collection. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the committee completed an extensive inquiry into the original TPP—and that was contained in report 165—a number of factors warranted an equally extensive inquiry into TPP-11, including:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most interesting insights of the inquiry is that the withdrawal of the United States is actually likely to benefit the Australian economy. This is because US exports to Japan will still be subject to tariffs higher than those that will be applying to Australian exports.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been particularly the case in relation to investor-state dispute settlement, commonly referred to as ISDS, and economic modelling.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To date, Australia has been subject to only two ISDS cases.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The improved ISDS provisions in the TPP-11 should prevent foreign investors from bringing ISDS cases against Australia in relation to income, social security, social welfare, public education, public training, health, child care, public utilities, public transport, public housing and the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">TPP-11 also signals future improvements in ISDS processes, such as an appellant mechanism, a code of ethics for ISDS arbitrators and the introduction of precedent in ISDS cases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The improved ISDS provisions in the TPP-11 mean that the Australian public should have confidence that the ISDS will not prevent the Australian government from regulating in the public interest when it is necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The participants in the inquiry engaged in a lengthy debate about the outcomes of economic modelling performed on the TPP and TPP-11.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, the debate about economic modelling was heated but not necessarily very illuminating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Economic modelling takes a series of assumptions about an economy based on previous evidence and casts that forward to predict outcomes in a limited range of fields.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A consequence of this is that outcomes from different types of modelling cannot necessarily be usefully compared.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, modelling a complex agreement like the TPP-11 environment in a real-world environment imposes necessary limitations on the accuracy of the predictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee considers that economic modelling is useful as a tool, amongst others, to inform decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the committee believes that there are significant benefits to be had, especially in the public perception of trade agreements, if the Australian government commissions modelling as part of the national interest analysis for future trade agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of this, the committee has recommended that the government, as part of the preparation of the national interest analysis, commission economic modelling of future trade agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to TPP provisions suspended in the TPP-11, the committee found that suspensions relating to intellectual property and copyright were widely though not universally supported as beneficial to Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also took evidence that reimposing the suspended provisions would have a significant impact on some sectors of the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee therefore recommends that a proposal to reimpose any of the suspended provisions should be considered a treaty amendment, resulting in a further inquiry by the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tendency towards protectionism in international trade has grown since it was first identified as a threat in the committee's report on the TPP two years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trade protectionism will have a significant impact on Australia's exports and consequently on employment here in Australia, if it continues to develop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Against this, the TPP-11 provides an important, positive example of international cooperation promoting rules based trade and investment liberalisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ratification would be an important contribution towards stabilising the trade environment, reinjecting momentum into cooperative trade liberalisation and a rules based approach to global trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommends the ratification of the TPP-11.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STERLE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:25</span>):  Fortuitously, I was reading some information that I've received on the TPP-11 as Senator Fawcett rose to speak. I will inform the Senate that I am not on the committee and I have not been to any of the meetings, but I've got some serious reservations about the TPP based on what has been put to me in what I was reading when Senator Fawcett first jumped up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm told that, to date, the TPP-11 has not been subjected to any independently commissioned economic analysis. A research paper from Tufts University about the TPP suggests that Australia would experience a net loss of some 39,000 jobs as a result of the treaty. It should be noted that the paper adopted the United Nations global policy model for the basis of its estimations and was co-authored by Jomo Kwame Sundaram, a former United Nations assistant secretary-general for economic development. It goes on to say that the TPP-11 is not in the national interests for several reasons. Australia has bilateral or multilateral arrangements already with seven of the 10 partnership countries in question, and there is one pending with Peru, so it is no surprise that there is limited economic benefit for Australian exporters. In saying that, I'm told that the estimated loss of tariff revenue for Australia from the TPP is approximately $25 million in 2016-17 and $135 million over the forward estimates period. More concerning, however, are the provisions in the agreement about labour mobility and investor-state dispute settlement, or ISDS, procedures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also been told, very clearly, there are many in the community with the view, which I share, that the government's contemporary approach to trade negotiations treats workers as a commodity. We cannot agree to that; I cannot agree to that. It's a very firm view from many that labour mobility must not be used as a bargaining chip in trade arrangements. These policies must be set by immigration agencies and ministers in light of broader questions of justice and national interest. This position is held by many in the community. Of course, it is not incompatible with many unions' support for migrants and migration, which I share and which, until the 1980s, was based largely on state-sponsored permanent skilled refugee and family reunion—which remains the preference of many—rather than temporary and employer-driven migration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the minister for trade and investment, Mr Ciobo, was on the front foot about the TPP-11 falsely claiming on the program <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span>, in regard to waiving of labour market testing:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… this doesn't apply to unskilled or low-skilled workers. It is not about bringing in cheap labour. What this is basically aimed at are senior managers, executives who work within often multinational corporations who need to be able to transfer between companies as part of that particular company's operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He then goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That's where this applies. It is not about cheap labour or unskilled labour as the unions would have you believe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… anything we—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">that's the government, not me—</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">have done, we have done on a reciprocal basis meaning we make it easier for Australian workers to go overseas as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm told both these claims by Minister Ciobo fail the test of scrutiny. The <span style="font-style:italic;">National interest analysis</span> put out by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, DFAT, states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A Ministerial determination will need to be made under section 140GBA of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958 </span>to exempt from labour market testing the intra-corporate transferees, independent executives and/or contractual service suppliers of those TPP-11 Parties to which Australia extended temporary entry commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This makes it clear that the TPP-11 temporary entry provisions include contractual service suppliers and removes the requirement—this is what grieves me—for labour market testing to establish whether there are Australian workers available. So, under the treaty, visas can be provided to workers in no fewer than 435 occupations. The broad definition of 'contractual service providers' in labour mobility chapters in Australia's trade agreements is not designed to facilitate genuine trade in services but to undermine local wages and conditions by providing greater freedom for employers to import labour on less favourable conditions without the need to undertake labour market testing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is also my view, and I will share that with our unions and with our communities, because I'm on the record many, many times as saying I have no problem with skilled migration—this nation was built on skilled migration—but I have a massive problem with trade agreements being used to ram down wages and conditions at the expense of Australian workers. Our kids need to be given the opportunity to do these traineeships and apprenticeships, and it is our kids who deserve to be employed in our nation. We should not be making it easy to bring in foreign workers on far worse conditions of employment than Australians can get. But, apart from that, Aussies must come first.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0U" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON-YOUNG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  I rise to distance the Australian Greens from the recommendations in this report. Just to be absolutely clear, an administrative error has meant that my name is on this report along with everybody else's. I do not support the recommendations outlined in this committee report, and the Australian Greens are on the record as having been consistently opposed to what we see as the very negative impacts and very few benefits of the TPP mark 1 and, now, the subsequent TPP mark 2.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report recommends that the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement proceed. The view of the Australian Greens is that it should not. We believe that the economic benefits outlined have been grossly exaggerated and the costs downplayed. We believe the agreement represents an affront to our democratic sovereignty and should be rejected in the strongest possible terms. Of course, having this committee look at this and report is effectively a formality. The real test will be when the initiating legislation comes before this house. That is going to be the test of how people on all sides of politics view the TPP and vote in relation to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the gravest concerns that the Australian Greens have in relation to the TPP is the inclusion in this agreement of investor-state dispute settlement provisions, the ISDS clauses. We've heard quite a bit about these clauses in the past. We know that, in the United States, there has been an incredible debate about this. We also know that, in Europe, there has been a much bigger debate about the impact of ISDS clauses in trade negotiations, and I note that, in the EU negotiations that Australia has started to participate in, it has already been made very clear that, from the European perspective, ISDS provisions are not to be included. I think that, in itself, sends a warning sign: why on earth would Australia be signing up to something that includes these provisions?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are they so bad? These measures advance the interests of corporations over the interests of governments and the citizens to whom they are accountable. We may pass a law in this place that we had promised to pass, the passing of that law by this house having been pushed and argued by the public and our constituents. Yet, if that law were to impact on a company that wanted to invest in Australia in some ways through this trade agreement, that foreign entity would be able to sue the Australian government and, therefore, the Australian people. That is why I believe it is fundamentally undemocratic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ISDS provisions expand the legal rights of multinational corporations based on legal concepts not even recognised in national systems and offer advantages not available to domestic investors. Why on earth would we be handing, on a silver platter, to multinational corporations—who, let's remember, have to be begged to even pay their taxes in this country—provisions to sue the government, whether federal, state or local government, and therefore the Australian people, particularly provisions that are not even available to Australian companies here on domestic soil? These provisions are unfair, they are unrepresentative and they are unnecessary. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't need them in order to develop and agree to various trade negotiations. We know that because they have been ruled out of our negotiations, as I mentioned, in relation to the EU. The fact that they are unnecessary is upheld by the recent decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union. These decisions, made in 2017 and 2018, found that ISDS is fundamentally incompatible with national sovereignty. That is what the EU Court of Justice has said. As a result, the EU is not proposing any form of ISDS in its negotiations, including in the Australia-EU Free Trade Agreement negotiations currently underway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The New Zealand government, as we know, has made it very clear throughout its negotiations that it does not support ISDS provisions as part of the TPP, and as a result it has negotiated to remove the ISDS provisions through four supplementary, legally binding side letters with Brunei, Malaysia, Peru and Vietnam. If it's good enough for New Zealand to do—to get out of being impacted by ISDS clauses—why on earth didn't Australia try to do it? Why wasn't Minister Ciobo making sure, at the negotiating table, that Australia was looked after and the Australian people were looked after? To give credit where credit is due, kudos to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern. She deserves a big tick for standing up for her nation, her people and her companies and making sure that sovereign risk is looked after from the New Zealand perspective. Those side letters commit New Zealand and these other countries to not applying ISDS provisions to each other. But Australia absolutely missed the boat when it came to being able to do that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These ISDS provisions are routinely used by multinational corporations to attack governments for doing what governments are supposed to do—namely, regulating in the interests of their communities and their citizens. Let's have a few quick examples of this. In 2016, Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis filed an ISDS dispute against the government of Colombia over the government's plans to reduce the price of patented treatment for leukaemia. So a big pharma multinational went and sued the Colombian government because the government wanted to make medicine cheaper for their citizens who are suffering from leukaemia. How on earth is that reasonable, just or fair? It is not, yet these are the types of provisions and behaviours that are being endorsed by the Australian government, the Turnbull government—the current, Turnbull government—and their Minister Ciobo in signing Australia up to these dangerous agreements under the TPP. We are opening ourselves up to big multinational companies coming after us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Sterle talked about the provisions in the TPP that have carved out big slabs from countries that will be exempt from labour-market testing. These are the same big multinational companies who don't just want to bring in their own workforce—to push down wages, to push down conditions and to take jobs away, particularly from young Australians—but they also want to hand these big multinational companies the opportunity to sue the government and to hold the Australian people to ransom. There is no need or reason for ISDS clauses. When they went back in to negotiate the TPP, the government should have used the opportunity to stand strong, to have the ISDS clauses withdrawn—they're not necessary—and to stand up for the rights of Australians and the sovereignty of a nation. This TPP arrangement is a deal for multinational corporations at the cost of local communities and governments. They've handed these big corporations everything they want on a platter, and now the Turnbull government want a big pat on the back and want us to say: 'Job well done.' Well, it was a terrible job, terribly done, and it should be rejected.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… The committee has previously accepted that the cashless welfare trial measures described above may pursue a legitimate objective. However, concerns have previously been raised as to whether the measures are rationally connected to (that is, effective to achieve) and proportionate to this objective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So they have repeated their concerns there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, when discussing the initial analysis of the bill, they note:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the report also contains some more mixed findings on the operation of the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the ORIMA report. The report continues:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For instance, while the statement of compatibility notes that nearly 40 per cent of non-participants in the trial perceived that violence in their community had decreased, and the ORIMA report pointed to evidence of the reduction in alcohol-related harm in the trial sites based on administrative data, the ORIMA report states that 'with the exception of drug driving offense and apprehensions under the Public Intoxication Act (PIA) in Ceduna, crime statistics showed no improvement since the commencement of the trial'. The ORIMA report also notes that 32 per cent of participants on average reported that the trial had made their lives worse; 33 per cent of participants had experienced adverse complications and limitations from the trial …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… in the East Kimberley, a greater proportion of participants felt that violence had increased rather than had decreased.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, in paragraph 2.23, the report states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… Of particular concern, as has been discussed in previous reports, is that the cashless debit card trial would be imposed without an assessment of individuals' suitability for the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People will remember that I raised that point earlier in regard to the bill that is currently before the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In paragraph 2.24, the report notes in relation to the bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… As the cashless debit card trial applies to anyone below the age of 35 residing in the trial location who receives the specified social security payments, there are serious doubts as to whether the measures are the least rights restrictive way of achieving the objective. In relation to the bill, this concern is heightened insofar as the trial applies not only to persons whose usual place of residence 'is or becomes' within the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area, but also applies to a person whose usual place of residence was within the area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It was not clear how the secretary would be made aware of whether a person's participation in the trial is impacting a person's mental, physical and emotional wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is another of the points I raised during my contribution earlier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's response—it gives a number of responses, but I'll run out of time if I deal with all of them—can be found in the report. It states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… Accordingly, and noting concerns raised by previous human rights assessments of the cashless welfare card trial, as well as related concerns regarding income management identified in the committee's <span style="font-style:italic;">2016 Review of Stronger Future measures</span>, the measures may not be compatible with the right to social security, the rights to privacy and family, and the right to equality and non-discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it deeply distressing that the government thinks that it is still acceptable to proceed to impose this unfair measure on the people in the Bundaberg-Hervey Bay area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now want to go to other areas in the report that deal with compatibility of the determinations with human rights. In paragraph 2.45, the report states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… The committee has previously commented upon the human rights compatibility of earlier versions of the determinations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This relates to some of the determinations under the cashless welfare card legislation. It says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… In relation to the declinable transactions determination, the committee raised concerns as to the compulsory quarantining of a person's welfare payments and the restriction of a person's agency and ability to spend their welfare payments at businesses including supermarkets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is not explained in the statement of compatibility the rationale for excluding persons of pension age in the Goldfields trial area but not the Ceduna or East Kimberley areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then the report goes on to discuss the minister's response to the concerns that had been raised with the minister. It then goes to the committee response to that and says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… The committee thanks the minister for his response …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It then says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… The preceding analysis in relation to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018 applies in relation to the determinations. That is, broadly, that concerns remain as to whether the cashless debit card trial is effective to achieve its stated objectives and is a proportionate limitation on human rights. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For this committee to say 'concerns remain' is pretty significant, given that, with all due respect to this joint committee, they're not well-known for their way-out reports. So I'd take that very seriously. The report says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the committee's latest report, tabled today. It reiterates and highlights some of the concerns that they have raised before in this place on several occasions around the review of the Stronger Futures legislation and previous attempts and applications of income management under previous cashless welfare card trials. The committee reiterate their concerns that the determinations may not be compatible with requirements Australia has under international conventions—the right to social security, the rights to privacy and family, and the rights to equality and nondiscrimination. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To reach this conclusion, the committee looked at and used the evidence contained in the ORIMA reports. And, if senators recall—going back to some of the comments I've made in this place on many occasions, particularly this week, on the cashless welfare card—the ANAO report also pointed out that the evidence is not there to show that the existing trials have reduced social harm. They also point out that all the relevant information and all the relevant data had not been included in those ORIMA evaluations. Imagine what the human rights committee would have said if they had had access to all the information that ORIMA conveniently left out of their evaluations, information that we had to go to the Western Australian government—and the Western Australian parliament, in fact—to get access to, because it had been conveniently left out. This report also points out the flawed use— </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Farm Household Support Amendment (Temporary Measures) Bill 2018 is a Bill to amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Farm Household Support Act 2014</span>. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill proposes two temporary changes to the Farm Household Allowance program. Firstly this Bill proposes to pay a supplement to all eligible Farm Household Allowance recipients that is in addition to their fortnightly income support payments. Secondly, we will increase the farm assets threshold to a net $5 million. The implementation date of 1 September 2018 for the net farm assets increase will be supported by a Minister's Rule under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Farm Household Support Act 2014.</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These temporary measures are designed to help our farmers in need in the short term while we undertake an independent review of the program. The review, to be completed in the first half of 2019, will provide further guidance on the design elements of the Farm Household Allowance into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australian agriculture is a story of success, resilience and prosperity. It is a significant contributor to the Australian economy and continues to be a strong performer. But right now Australia's farming families across a lot of the east as well as parts of the west, are going through tough times. And when times are tough, the government listens and lends a hand to those in need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Farm Household Allowance has always been more than a social security payment – it's a package of assistance comprising income support, an independent financial assessment of the farm business, individualised case management, and an activity supplement that pays for advice and training. The safety net provided by this program ensures the government can appropriately support farmers in hardship while they take steps to improve their situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Increasing the net farm asset threshold to $5 million will give more farmers access to the Farm Household Allowance during times of hardship. It will help those farmers who have little or no cash flow access to assistance – assistance that provides them an allowance as well as breathing room to prepare for and adapt to change. It means these farmers will not have to sell their assets and risk taking away some or all of their future income producing capacity of their farm business. It also recognises that farm assets can be difficult to sell quickly and, during tough times, often sold for less than they're worth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Increasing the threshold also helps those recipients already on the program. They can be secure knowing they will remain eligible for the program even if their farm assets experience an increase in value, but their cash flow remains low. They will not be placed in the situation of having to urgently sell assets to support themselves, potentially to the detriment to their future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government is committed to increasing the farm assets threshold as soon as practicable. To this end, we will develop a new Minister's Rule under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Farm Household Support Act 2014</span> that provides 1 September 2018 as the date from which the increase will take effect. Implementation arrangements will be in place by 1 October 2018 to allow assessment of these FHA applications from then.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our proposed FHA supplement will be payable to all Farm Household Allowance recipients in addition to their existing payments, in two lump sums between 1 September 2018 and 1 June 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Each lump sum will be $3,000 per person for members of a couple, and $3,600 for singles. This means if both members of a couple are receiving Farm Household Allowance between 1 September 2018 and 1 June 2019 they will receive $6,000 each, or $12,000 per household. For singles, the maximum amount payable will be $7,200.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Everyone who is on Farm Household Allowance is eligible for the lump sum payment. They don't need to apply for it, it will automatically be paid. If they receive FHA at any stage between 1 September 2018 and 1 December 2018 they'll get the first payment. Farmers on FHA at any stage between 2 December 2018 and 1 June 2019 will also receive a payment. People on FHA for both periods will receive the two payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No farmer who lodges a claim for FHA on or before 1 December will be disadvantaged. Subject to being eligible for FHA they will be back paid their FHA allowance to the date of lodgement and will also receive the supplement. Also, if they receive any FHA during the second payment period (2 December to 1 June 2019) they will receive the supplement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The FHA supplement will give farming families what they sorely lack right now—cash. The additional disposable income will help put food on the table and cover basic expenses such as bills and school fees and will flow through to businesses in country towns doing it tough. As with the increase to the farm assets threshold, it will provide a safeguard for farm families that might otherwise be forced to liquidate farm assets to support themselves, and deliver significant benefits to them and their communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These changes to the Farm Household Allowance will be supported by an additional $5 million to the Rural Financial Counselling Service. The RFCS is there to assist farmers, to help them understand what's available. They sit at the kitchen tables and get under the bonnet of farmers' businesses to help them make strategic decisions. The RFCS is not a bricks and mortar service. Staff are highly mobile and can visit people on-farm or in town. These funds will provide additional financial councillors and support for farmers, particularly those applying for FHA for the first time. This will be of enormous value to farmers who are eligible but have not yet applied.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Human Services also has specialist staff available through the Farmer Assistance Hotline (132 316) and Farm Household Case Officers who provide assistance and support to farmers and their communities. Where a farmer is facing genuine hardship, and full claim details have been received by the Department of Human Services, a decision can be prioritised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a result of the continued dry conditions we are experiencing a surge in applications for FHA. The Department of Human Services has been working to identify ways to make the application process simpler and quicker for farmers. In the meantime, to ensure that much needed money gets to our farmers as quickly as possible, the Department of Human Services will be looking at a risk-based approach for processing applications. Post-claim checking will limit the risk of overpayment that would need to be repaid to government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In June this year, we extended the Farm Household Allowance program from three to four years, as we knew some farmers and their families had been, and continue to be, subject to pressures extending beyond a cumulative three year period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are also investing $11.4 million in mental health support initiatives with additional funding for Primary Health Networks and community-led initiatives through the Empowering Communities program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All of these measures are immediate and material. These commitments, in addition to our most recent and further announcement, brings our Government's commitment to farmers experiencing drought to $1.8 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In seeking to increase the net farm assets threshold and introduce the FHA supplement, this Bill further demonstrates this government's ongoing commitment to ensuring farming families and communities get the support they need for the conditions they are facing in rural and regional Australia, to recover and get back on their feet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:55</span>):  I was discussing the idea of the government conducting an independent review for the evaluation of the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay trial. This review would have to be undertaken by independent evaluation experts with significant expertise in the social and economic aspects of welfare policy. It would begin immediately when the minister receives the evaluation, and would be completed within six months, conducted by an independent panel with expertise in the social and economic aspects of welfare policy. The expert would consult participants in the trial and make recommendations as to whether the cashless welfare arrangements are effective and should be implemented elsewhere. My hope would be that the National Audit Office, given the quality of its work and its expertise in this particular area, conduct this review, but it is not within the powers of the Senate to make a direction in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that many are opposed to the trials, and that there has been criticism of the extent of community consultation, the implementation of the card, its outcomes and the shortcomings of the evaluations themselves, but there are recipients of the cashless debit card in the trials to date who have welcomed it. They say, for example, that in their cases it has prevented others—be they spouses, family members or not—from accessing their social security payments and excessively spending them on nonessential items, usually alcohol, to the harm of those whom the payments need to assist. In my consideration of this bill I have noted these people, as well as those recipients and advocacy groups that have not welcomed these initiatives in the cashless debit card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not support further trials or extensions of the cashless welfare card if these trials are shown to be detrimental to its objectives; however, I genuinely believe in giving initiatives a chance if they have the potential to help the vulnerable in society. I will always seek to conduct my politics based on reliable data and evaluation. Therefore I will be asking the Senate to support an independent evaluation of the government's review of the card. If we can get reliable data out of this trial and have the review of that data independently evaluated and reported, we will significantly better understand what we should do in the future with regard to the cashless debit card.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LINES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:58</span>):  I rise to oppose the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card Trial Expansion) Bill 2018. I have participated in some but not all of the committee hearings in relation to the cashless debit card, but I did participate in the most recent hearing—I think it was slightly longer than two hours—for the trials to commence in the Bundaberg region. I have very real concerns about this particular trial in Bundaberg. I listened very carefully to what Senator Storer said about his support for this particular bill. I would ask him to reconsider and look at what has been happening. Labor supported the Ceduna and East Kimberley trials, because we believed there'd been proper consultation and local people on the ground were keen to participate in the trial. On that basis we agreed to those trials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We wanted to see a decent evaluation occur. I hear Senator Storer calling for an independent evaluation. The government would argue that the ORIMA evaluation was independent. So I think we need more than an independent trial. But the ORIMA evaluation has been widely discredited by all quarters of our society, except, of course, by the Turnbull government. It's been discredited because there was no baseline data. We didn't really know what was happening in the East Kimberley or Ceduna before we commenced the trial. And it was done in such an ad hoc, unprofessional way. People were stopped in the street and were asked their personal views about whether they thought their use of alcohol or drugs had declined. We all like to underestimate how we might overuse things that aren't particularly good for us, so I'm sure that most people, if asked whether their alcohol consumption had decreased, would probably say yes. Perhaps most of us are unaware of what our real alcohol consumption is. But that isn't the only reason the ORIMA evaluation was discredited. It was discredited by academics, by organisations who work with people who need support and by a whole range of other people, who just said that this trial really didn't prove anything—and it absolutely didn't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You will hear the government make claims about crime reduction, domestic violence reduction and all sorts of harm-inducing behaviours having been reduced, but there's no proof of that. Everything is anecdotal. Of course, the ORIMA research was never able to do a proper evaluation of that, because there's no baseline—there's no baseline data. What we do know is that the cashless debit card is very, very expensive. In the East Kimberley and Ceduna it's costing about $10,000 per participant. Just imagine if we were able to take that amount of money and put it into support services in those communities. I think that would make an immediate difference. What we know from Mr Lawford Benning is that lots of services were initially promised by Minister Tudge, particularly for the Kununurra region, and none of those were delivered. Certainly in evidence at the Kalgoorlie hearing, Mr Benning told us that Mr Tudge was contacting a group of local leaders on an almost weekly basis until they agreed to trial the card, and then, once they agreed, that support completely dropped away. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is still waiting for a decent, proper academic evaluation to be done in the East Kimberley and in Ceduna. We understand from the government that that will be done, but the proof will be in the pudding so that we can get a sense of what is actually happening on the ground in those communities in my state of Western Australia. So, while we have this trial site that the government set up at the behest of 'Twiggy' Forrest, we shouldn't be rolling out any further trials, because we really don't know whether what's happened on the ground in the two trial sites has made any difference at all. Yet, not only have we seen the government continue to roll trials out; they've completely changed the goalposts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After the debate in this place enabled the card to be put into the Goldfields regions, I went there recently—about four weeks ago—and, along with the local Labor member for Kalgoorlie, Kyle McGinn, we held an opening meeting. It was advertised as an open meeting. We wanted people who supported the card to come; we wanted people who opposed the card to come. But, most importantly, we wanted people who were on the card to come. As I said, it was an open invitation. It was advertised widely in the media, on social media and through organisations, because we wanted to have an open consultation. We wanted to hear the good and the bad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was very clear, when we held the Senate inquiry on the cashless debit card in Kalgoorlie, that local people had not been consulted. I heard Senator Brockman today say there had been broad consultation, and I heard Senator Georgiou say a similar thing. But the consultation was with the local councils in the Goldfields region. You know, 10 points to the government for being very clever about that: 'Tick, we've consulted, because we've brought the local governments together and they've agreed with the cards.' Thankfully, the local government organisations came to the hearing that we had in Kalgoorlie, and so I asked each and every one of them what consultation they'd undertaken as local governments. The answer from all the councils was that there had been none. They saw themselves as elected representatives, and they saw it as their responsibility to agree or not agree with the card. I really pressed the Mayor of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, Mr John Bowler, about the consultation that occurred in Kalgoorlie, and it was very clear from his evidence that there had been none. That was certainly backed up by evidence that we heard from organisations and individuals in Kalgoorlie that they hadn't been consulted. We know that in Kununurra local people were not consulted as widely as Labor was led to believe, because we know that in Kununurra people initially thought the card was like a gift card and, once you'd used it once, you didn't use it again, so they threw it away. We heard some evidence of that happening in Ceduna as well. So the Labor senators on the inquiry were very committed to trying to work with the witnesses to find out how much consultation had actually taken place. As I said, the councils believed it was their decision to make, and so they made the decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also evident that the kinds of supports that we need in the towns are not there. Of course, people from all sorts of communities, including the lands where the card doesn't operate, come down to Kalgoorlie when they need to visit a hospital, to deal with a Centrelink office face to face, to deal with some other community organisation face to face or, of course, to visit family and friends. What's happening with the people from the lands, if you believe what the Kalgoorlie council told us, is that they're getting caught up and not being able to get back to the lands. Most councils—in fact, I think all the councils—told us that the issues of poor behaviour and other social issues weren't really from locals in the town. All of them saw it as people coming in from other areas and creating those social problems. So here we have this very blunt instrument that captures everybody on a benefit, except an age pension benefit, across a massive geographical region, when every single council told us that it was people coming in from other areas who they believed were their biggest challenge. So it is absolutely incredible that we would use this blunt instrument to capture what seems to be an itinerant issue and not a local issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor senators managed to find some people who would be affected by the card, and they gave evidence. It's fair to say some people wanted the card and some didn't. The other thing I'll say before I move on is that both Senator Georgiou and Senator Brockman, in their responses, talked about the broadscale consultation that happened in the Goldfields. I just went back and looked at the transcript. We had Mr Brian Champion, who is the deputy chair of the Goldfields Aboriginal Reference Group. He said they were not consulted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had Mr Brownley, who I think is now a councillor. He is an Aboriginal person—that is how he described himself—and a business owner. He said there'd been little consultation. We heard from Mr Donaldson of the Goldfields Land and Sea Council, who told us there had been little consultation. In fact, Mr Donaldson said that the Kalgoorlie Council, in particular, had hand-picked a group of people that they wanted to take to Ceduna. Mr Donaldson not only made the point that they hand-picked a group of local people—no women, and he objected to that—but he said he wanted to go to Kununurra and not Ceduna, but the council was offering Ceduna only. So, here we had this hand-picked group, which was also going to be used as a tick-off for consultation, being taken to Ceduna when they actually wanted to visit the East Kimberley also. We heard from YMAC, the Yamatji Marlpa Aboriginal Corporation, which is the native title body for the traditional owners of the Pilbara, Mid West, Murchison and Gascoyne regions. YMAC doesn't support the expansion of the cashless debit card, but said it had had little information about the card and its implications. So, I'm not sure what Senators Brockman and Georgiou are reading from, but it is certainly not from the transcript.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point that I want to make a statement about is that in Senator Georgiou's contribution earlier today he held up—and I wish he had tabled it—what he said was a media release from the Mayor of Kalgoorlie, Mr John Bowler. I'm not doubting that it is a media release from the mayor, but my office has gone to great lengths to try to find that media release. It is not anywhere on the council's website—in fact, the last time I'm aware of that Mr Bowler made a media comment was a couple of weeks ago in relation to mining issues in Kalgoorlie. It hasn't been published at all. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Kalgoorlie Miner</span> certainly hasn't published the statement reportedly made by Mr Bowler, according to what Senator Georgiou read out, that there is less crime in Kalgoorlie. So, we ended up phoning the council and saying, 'The mayor has put out a media release saying the cashless debit card is doing wonders in Kalgoorlie in terms of reducing crime, and we'd like a copy of it.' Do you know what they said? 'Oh, we don't keep copies of the mayor's media releases. We don't really see them.' So, I'm led to believe that maybe it's a concocted media release to put on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> for the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take issue with two things: first, how dare the Mayor of Kalgoorlie make an assumption that there's some link between crime and people on benefits—what an outrageous statement to be making; and, second, to say there's been a reduction in crime. Now—Acting Deputy President Sterle, I know you know Kalgoorlie well—that might be because the Western Australian Police are targeting Kalgoorlie. They've had an operation in place there since the introduction of the cashless debit card. It's a coincidence. There's a greater police presence on the street, which I'm sure the mayor must know about. I don't know if it's in this fictitious media release, which can't be found anywhere, except for the copy that Senator Georgiou has. I'm just wondering whether it's a made-up media release. To actually make a link between crime statistics and people on benefits is an insult, when there are no statistics at all that hold that kind of statement to be true. Also, to not acknowledge—and I'm assuming it's not acknowledged in the media release, and, as I said, it's a shame it's not tabled—that the police have a particular operation going on in Kalgoorlie, as I speak, is very dishonest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I return now to the meeting I held with Kyle McGinn, the Labor member up there in Kalgoorlie, which, as I said, we opened up to everyone. We had representatives from the Kalgoorlie council come along to the meeting—two of them, the CEO and another gentleman. They didn't bother to identify themselves. Quite frankly, I wouldn't have known who they were except that participants in the room told me. How dishonest is that? I was quite happy to have dissent there, to have the good and bad. It was widely advertised. At the start of the meeting I stood up and said: 'I want this to be a respectful debate. There are people in here who support the card and there are people in here who oppose the card. I'm simply trying to get a read of what's happening in the room'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were two representatives from One Nation, who, equally, tried to hide and not identify themselves. There were two other representatives from one of the other councils who also didn't identify themselves. Thankfully, as I said, Kyle McGinn knew who they were and so did many of the participants. To sit in a meeting, in some kind of cloak-and-dagger way, and not identify yourself is, quite frankly, really dishonest. If you're going to support something, have the courage to stand up to your convictions and not chicken out. I've written to those councils saying, 'It's a shame you didn't identify yourselves', and they haven't responded. I find that completely unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard horror stories about the cashless debit card in Kalgoorlie. We had one woman who'd worked all of her life. She was in her early 60s. She has anxiety issues. She found it very difficult to come to the meeting, but she was so determined to put her story on the public record that she came. She'd worked all her life. She hurt herself at work and is now on a benefit and so was captured by the card. This is a very conservative woman, a very traditional woman. She always had a joint bank account with her husband. She broke down in tears as she told us that the cashless debit card forced her to open her own bank account. I explained to her that there are good reasons as to why we want women in particular to have their own bank accounts, but this was a very conservative, traditional woman. For her whole working life, her whole married life, she had shared a bank account with her husband and suddenly was being asked to do something different. The words of Twiggy Forrest rang in my in ears, when he said, 'This card will provide stability'. Well, it certainly hasn't for that woman. He said, 'This card will provide reliability'. Well, it didn't for her. She was torn apart by that card. She tried to get off it and was refused.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was no-one in the room who was a heavy drinker. There was no-one in the room who was a gambler. There were grandmothers. There were single men with responsibilities for children. There were mums. There were dads. There were a whole range of people who were having real, everyday issues with that card, like the person who was paying their rent but couldn't pay a water bill without ringing the department and asking for permission. If that isn't an invasion upon your personal wellbeing, I don't know what is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a blunt instrument. It's not doing what it's designed to do, because people need that one-on-one support, not this blanket response. Now we're rolling it out into Bundaberg to people under 36. We see those goalposts move again. I remain opposed to this. Let's get a proper evaluation out of the single trial that's going at the moment and get on with the job.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:19</span>):  I rise to speak in the shadow of the great date 1 September that is rapidly approaching, known as Wattle Day for Australia. I notice, as many of my colleagues have noticed, the wattle already in bloom along the great highways that bring politicians to this place, to acknowledge our Australianness in this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today in my speech I call on Australians, in particular young Australian women, to think about what this date, 1 September, Wattle Day, can mean for them in our time. This 1 September is a gathering date for people who support the Australian Republican movement. My point in making this contribution to the adjournment debate this evening in the Senate is to highlight that young women have a vital role to play in the making of our nation right now. A conversation is being reinvigorated about what sort country we are to be. What sort of country are we to be for young women who are looking down the barrel of 50 to 60 wonderful years of being an Australian? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question is: do we really need to have a head of state who inherits the title to rule over this nation and who lives on the other side of the world? I will make the comment that how I don't care how lovely their shoes are. I'm still happy to look at Kate Middleton and the 'nude shoe' movement that she started, and Meghan Markle and the wedding. I'm also interested in Princess Mary from Denmark and in royal fashion, which might be something that entices young women and is interesting. It is certainly presented up to them on a regular basis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as an Australian, I don't need a family on the other side of the world to rule over this country. It's time for all Australians, particularly the young leaders in our community, to stand up and say: 'We're grown up enough now to leave the nest. We don't need the burden of the connection to a country on the other side of the world. We need an opportunity to find, amongst our own, a great Australian to become the president of this nation.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Saturday evening, I attended the Daniel Deniehy Oration, which has occurred in Goulburn on an annual basis now for about five years. It is facilitated by a wonderful former senator who sat in this chamber with all of us for a period of time, Senator Ursula Stephens. I acknowledge that she is running for the state seat of Goulburn, and I sincerely hope that she will be elected to the Parliament of New South Wales and bring her considerable talent to that place. Like me, former Senator Stephens has a passion for the establishment of a republic in this country. Perhaps it's the Irish heritage that we share. It was an 800-year-long struggle for Ireland to declare itself a republic. In my remarks on Saturday night in response to a wonderful oration by the former Premier of Western Australia, Geoff Gallop, I indicated that I hoped it might not take us 800 years to get to the point where we, too, become a republic. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an opportunity now. I urge young women in Australia to think about the possibility of your contribution to making Australia an independent nation—to know in your hearts and desire in your practical action to bring about the change that will deliver a different perspective on Australia in the world at large, and to bring about in your actions and your desire the opportunity for an Australian to be our head of state. That is what we can achieve, collectively, in our desire to become a republic. Young women of Australia, we should not leave it to the men, who are predominant in this debate. Young women of Australia, there's a moment when you know that it's time to move on. As a former teacher, I have confidence in the young people of this nation. On 1 September, get your friends together, have a high tea, have a barbecue, or get together on a beach. Make sure you support a republic on 1 September. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ANNING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:24</span>):  Today the Queensland Labor government introduced new laws to legalise the abortion of babies up to 22 weeks old, effectively as a routine means of contraception. Babies much older than 22 weeks can also be terminated, with medical support. Let us be clear: what is being legislated here is nothing less than state-sanctioned murder. A baby at 22 weeks is a fully formed person and, although premature, capable of growing to an adult and living a full and normal life. James Elgin Gill was born in Ontario when he was barely more than 21 weeks old and still survives today. In most US states, if a woman who is 22 weeks pregnant is run down by a drunk driver, the driver will be charged with killing two people, not one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In defence of these laws, some may say, 'It's a woman's right to decide what happens to her own body.' But this is disingenuous. No-one disputes a woman's right to decide what happens to her; only her right to decide what happens to someone else. Just because the unborn cannot speak for themselves doesn't mean they aren't still entitled to the same rights as anyone else. Even if you have conceived them, no person should be able to own another. If it was wrong for a plantation owner in the antebellum south to have the power of life and death over his slaves, so too is it wrong for a woman to have the power of life and death over the child within her. Life once granted by God may only be taken by God.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This appalling law by the Queensland government also actually forces doctors to act against their own conscience. Doctors who morally object to their involvement in abortion will be legally permitted to refuse only if they can find another doctor who agrees. A human being asked to sever a baby's spine and then crush its head is the most barbaric murder imaginable. In compelling doctors to undertake abortions, this law by the Queensland state government actually contravenes the Hippocratic oath, which includes the words:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I will use treatment to help the sick according to my ability and judgment, but never with a view to injury and wrong-doing. Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked to do so, nor will I suggest such a course. Similarly I will not give to a woman a pessary to cause abortion. But I will keep pure and holy both my life and my art.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dating back 2,500 years, the earliest known expression of medical ethics, the Hippocratic oath has survived the millennia only to be extinguished by the laws of the Palaszczuk government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why murder of the innocent is being legalised in Queensland is beyond my understanding. I can only conclude that the state's new abortion laws are a direct result of the influence of the hard left on the current Palaszczuk regime. These laws are an affront to free speech, an affront to the medical profession and an affront to the sanctity of life. I, and my party, condemn this immoral action by the Queensland government in the strongest terms. I pledge that if Katter's Australian Party gains the balance of power after the next Queensland election we'll insist that these heinous abortion laws be repealed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:28</span>):  On Wednesday last week, I and my colleague Senator Brown moved a motion in the Senate which called on the Turnbull government to commit to the long-term future of the Australian Antarctic Division at its Kingston headquarters south of Hobart. The work of the AAD is world-leading and supported by a workforce of around 300, many of whom are based in Kingston. Senator Brown and I chose to raise these concerns in this place because we're aware of discussions that have been going on regarding relocating the AAD headquarters and its staff to the Hobart CBD.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For several months, discussions about the Antarctic precinct proposal have been taking place between the Macquarie Point Development Corporation, the Department of State Growth and several agencies involved in the Antarctic Program, including the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology, the University of Tasmania, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, the Tasmanian Polar Network and the AAD. I understand that it has also been raised in discussions about the Hobart City Deal, and that the Department of the Environment and Energy is giving the AAD's involvement in the new precinct serious consideration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kingston is a small urban centre, and the loss of 300 jobs would be a huge blow to its local economy. The AAD supports local cafes and retailers, manufacturers and suppliers. The move would also significantly contribute to the worsening congestion of traffic into the city. Two local businesses that have raised concerns publicly are the Kingston florist and Clennett's Mitre 10. Kingston florist owner Sally Rogers told the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercury</span>, the Hobart newspaper, recently:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We need jobs in the area after losing Vodafone not long ago and the Southern Outlet is already busy enough without hundreds of extra people having to travel into Hobart for work …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our call to keep the AAD in Kingston has been echoed by the Kingborough Council. The Kingborough Council unanimously resolved that their meeting on 23 July to communicate to the Minister for the Environment and Energy, Mr Frydenberg, their desire for the headquarters to stay in its current location and for there to be no net loss of staff from Kingborough. The mayor of Kingborough, Councillor Steve Wass, has also been to see both federal government and opposition representatives, including me and Senator Brown, to discuss the issue. And I understand that Mayor Wass received verbal assurances from Tasmanian Liberal senators that the AAD would remain in Kingston but nothing has yet been provided in writing. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">No decision has been made. Senator Abetz had said to us that there had been a decision. The minister said 'no decision'. So who's really putting forward the position of the Turnbull government? Is it Senator Abetz, who claims that the government is firmly committed to keeping the AAD in Kingston, or is it Minister Frydenberg, who says that no decision has been made? It can't be both. I'm not comfortable with the verbal assurances apparently given to Kingborough Council by Tasmanian Liberal senators when the minister's statement is contradictory. </span>

It's time for Minister Frydenberg and the Turnbull government to stand up for the residents of Kingston and commit to the Australian Antarctic Division headquarters remaining where they have been since 1980, in a purpose-built facility, and where they still belong.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:33</span>):  Bicycle helmet laws are a classic sign of the nanny state. When people decide to ride without a helmet, they risk their own lives, not the lives of others. They don't hurt anyone else with their naked heads. They shouldn't be threatened with fines for doing this. Government exists to prevent harm to others, not to prevent harm to ourselves. Governments should serve the people, not vice versa. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Australia include our Sikh community. One in every 200 Australians is Sikh. The principles of the Sikh faith are to treat all as equals, work hard to make a living and do good in the community. That's why you're more likely to come across a Sikh Australian as your Uber driver than as a welfare recipient. You will recognise male Sikh Australians by the turban they wear to protect their uncut but prodigiously clean hair. This is a practice dictated by their faith. It's not a fashion to be cast aside on a whim. That is why our compulsory helmet laws are particularly oppressive for male Sikh Australians. Because of the helmet laws, Sikh boys are effectively banned from riding their bicycles to and from their school and around their suburb with their non-Sikh friends. How is this helping integration? Sikh men—even Sikh farmers taking a short trip between their adjacent farms—are prevented from riding their motorbikes on public roads. Four of the eight states and territories exempt Sikh Australians from bicycle helmet laws: Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. In my home state of New South Wales, a Sikh Australian can be fined up to $2,200 for not wearing a helmet on a bicycle. No state or territory exempts Sikh Australians from motorcycle helmet laws, which can involve fines in excess of $2,200. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's approach is out of step with the rest of the world. Almost no other countries in the world make the wearing of helmets compulsory when riding a bicycle, so no discrimination against their Sikh communities arises in this regard. While other countries have compulsory motorbike helmet laws, a number of countries provide exemptions for their Sikh community. For example, the United Kingdom has a blanket exemption. New Zealand has an exemption for riding a motorbike at under 50 kilometres an hour if you carry an exemption certificate, or for riding a motorbike at under 30 kilometres an hour between adjacent farms. The province of Alberta in Canada has an exemption for off-highway travel. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am both a bicycle rider and a motorbike rider, and I would choose to wear a helmet regardless of the law when riding my motorbike. I confess I wouldn't when riding my bicycle. But it would be extreme arrogance for me to assert that others must wear a helmet, irrespective of my view. Penalising a Sikh Australian for wearing a turban instead of a helmet represents unwarranted and petty religious discrimination. Given that religious freedom is the one freedom guaranteed in our Constitution, it is even possible that compulsory helmet laws as they apply to Sikh Australians are unconstitutional. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government to amend the Australian Road Rules to exempt Sikh Australians from helmet laws, and I call on each state and territory government to adopt such an amendment in their legislation.</span>
