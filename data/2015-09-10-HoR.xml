                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, I commend you on the way that you have come into the chair over the last number of weeks and the excellent job you have been doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will implement the government's 2015 budget measure that will provide more generous and consistent support for families with dependent young people who qualify for certain youth income support payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 January 2016, this will include removing the family assets test and the family actual means test from the youth allowance parental means test arrangements. This will result in a more consistent level of support for families, as young people move from family tax benefit part A to an additional income support payment. The parental income test exemptions for youth allowance will also be aligned with existing arrangements for family tax benefit A.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also from 1 January 2016, maintenance income will be removed from the youth allowance parental income test assessment. From 1 January 2017, a separate maintenance income test for the treatment of child support will be applied, like the test that currently applies to family tax benefit part A.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last component of this budget measure will apply from 1 July 2016 to families that have dependent children receiving individual youth payments that are parentally income-tested, and also younger dependent siblings. In those circumstances, the 'family pool', as it is known, for the youth parental income test will include a notional maximum rate of family tax benefit A for all of the children for whom the parents have financial responsibility. This will result in a lower rate of reduction to the dependent child's youth allowance than is currently the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With a financial commitment from the government of $262.7 million over the forward estimates, this bill will bring extra support to some 30,000 families, it is estimated, to further support those families as their child moves into young adulthoodâ€”particularly rural and regional families whose children continue to study beyond year 12.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Removing the family assets test for youth allowance will allow around 4,100 additional dependent youth allowance claimants to qualify for the first time, accessing average annual payments of more than $7,000 a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Removing the family actual means test will see around 1,200 more people receiving youth allowance for the first time, as well as increasing payments for around 4,860 existing students by approximately $2,000 a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes mean farming families will not have farm assets counted towards the means test for their dependent children claiming youth allowanceâ€”an important reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Including all FTB children in the family pool for the youth parental income test will allow around 13,700 families with dependent children in both the family tax benefit part A and youth systems to become eligible for an average increase in payment of around $1,100 a year. Around 5,800 families, who currently miss out on payments due to the combined high taper rates, will also become eligible for an average payment of around $1,300 per year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes will reduce significantly the regulatory burden on around 30,000 families subject to the family actual means test and around 200,000 families subjected to the family assets test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures were adopted following an examination of issues by an interdepartmental committee on access to higher education for regional and remote students at the urging of Senator McKenzie and her backbench colleagues, who have been pressing us to do more to improve access to education for regional and remote students. I want to thank those members for their significant engagement with us as we have worked through these measures. I particularly want to acknowledge also the member for Forrest and the member for Wannon for their very strong advocacy on behalf of their constituents in relation to these matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Removing complex and unnecessary means tests and improving the operation of the parental income test is a good first step, and I know the member for Forrest, the member for Wannon and Senator McKenzie know that this is just a first step, but it is an important first step, as I know they also acknowledge. But it is a good first step, and it responds to concerns over parental means testing and the level of student assistance available, which were identified in the interdepartmental committee's interim advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bridget McKenzie has just completed a series of regional higher education forums, supported by my department, to discuss access to higher education, the IDC's interim advice and the 2015-16 budget. Feedback from the forums will provide useful input into the final report of the interdepartmental committee that is due in November 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is boosting assistance for working families, particularly in rural and regional areas, and better supporting young people into study to build their careers, develop economic opportunities and contribute to our economy. I commend the bill to the House.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to introduce the Australian Immunisation Register Bill 2015. The Australian Immunisation Register Bill 2015 creates a new, consolidated legislative framework for the establishment and ongoing management of Australian immunisation registers and expands the scope of our two existing immunisation registers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes implement measures announced in this yearâ€™s federal budget as part of the governmentâ€™s focus on improving immunisation rates across Australia and will complement other government initiatives, including 'no jab, no pay' and new catch-up incentives to GPs and other immunisation providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has a strong track record when it comes to improving immunisation rates, successfully increasing vaccination rates from 52 per cent in 1996 up to around 90 per cent, and it was the current Prime Minister, as the then health minister who introduced the human papillomavirus, HPV, vaccination program for school-aged women in 2007. These new measures build on our successful record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned previously, the scope of our two current immunisation registers will be broadened. The Australian Childhood Immunisation Register, ACIR, will be expanded to become the Australian Immunisation Register, which will capture all vaccines given from birth to death through general practice and community clinics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACIR currently records vaccinations given to children aged less than seven years. The ACIR will be expanded in two stages. From 1 January 2016, it will expand to collect and record vaccinations given to young individuals under the age of 20 years, enabling implementation of the governmentâ€™s 'no jab, no pay' budget measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From September 2016, it will be expanded further to cover all vaccinations from birth to death given through general practice and community clinics, supporting the addition of the zoster virus vaccine to the National Immunisation Program for persons aged 70 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Implementing these changes to our national immunisation registers will broaden and improve immunisation data capture to assist recognised vaccination providers to boost coverage rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, this bill expands the National Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Program Register to become the Australian School Vaccination Register, which will capture all adolescent vaccinations given through school programs from the start of the 2017 school year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The HPV register currently only captures administration of the HPV vaccine. Other adolescent vaccinations administered through the school programs that would be captured in the Australian Schools Vaccination Register include varicella (chickenpox) and the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) booster.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, separate legislation within the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953 provide the foundation for how the two national immunisation registers are operated. In this context, it is considered timely to consolidate the two pieces of separate legislation for the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register and Australian School Vaccination Register into a new, single piece of legislation to provide for the ongoing management and data capture for both registers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will lay the foundations for future work to move towards an integrated system that captures and reports on all vaccines given in Australia from birth to death, providing a single â€˜front doorâ€™ for consumers and immunisation providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides the framework under which Australian immunisation registers are operated and removes obstacles associated with the appropriate collection of personal information. This includes detailing the provisions in which individuals can access personal information, the type of information collected and including offence provisions that detail the offence generated by unauthorised disclosure of personal information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides for the establishment of the register and the recording of certain personal information about individuals. The bill also creates an offence for the unauthorised disclosure of personal information contained within the register.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments contained within this bill will commence in three stages. From 1 January 2016 the new Australian Immunisation Register Act 2015 will commence and it will facilitate the collection of information of â€˜young individualsâ€™ under the age of 20 years to assist the implementation of the governmentâ€™s 'no jab, no pay' budget measure. At the same time, a number of required consequential amendments will be made to other legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendments commencing in September 2016 include amendments to the Australian Immunisation Register Act 2015 to reflect the name change and expansion of the ACIR to the Australian Immunisation Register and the Healthcare Identifiers Act 2010. These amendments will accommodate the governmentâ€™s approval to list the zoster virus (shingles) vaccine (Zostavax) on the National Immunisation Program for persons aged 70 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, from 1 January 2017 onwards, the Australian Schools Vaccination Register will capture all adolescent vaccinations given through school programs from the start of the school year. Provisions of the new bill will apply equally to the Australian Immunisation Register and the Australian School Vaccination Register and part 9BA of the National Health Act 1953 will be repealed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this bill, expansion of the national immunisation registers and the way they continue to operate in the future will not only benefit the health of individuals; general practitioners and health care providers but also provide a consistent way in which immunisation records can be obtained for individuals of all ages, not just the young. I commend the bill to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I introduce the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Further Strengthening Job Seeker Compliance) Bill 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will create a simpler and more effective compliance framework to ensure that job seekers are meeting their mutual obligation requirements at every point throughout the job seeking process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill builds on the successful reforms made last year by the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Job Seeker Compliance Framework) Act 2014. That bill applied the 'no show no pay' principle to provide a stronger incentive for job seekers to attend their appointments with their employment service providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms have proven highly effective in ensuring job seekers are meeting their mutual obligation requirements. For instance, in 2013-14â€”before the changes were introducedâ€”only 65 per cent of job seekers who missed an initial appointment actually turned up for their second rescheduled appointment. By comparison, in June 2015 over 90 per cent of job seekers are now attending these rescheduled appointments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very positive outcome for both job seekers and employment service providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It means more job seekers are doing the right thing and taking advantage of the help on offer and receiving their income support as intended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also means less red tape and costs for providers. Instead of having to spend time trying to contact the job seekerâ€”and then more time filling in forms to report the noncompliance and book rescheduled appointmentsâ€”providers can use their time to actually help job seekers with practical tasks like looking for work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes introduced last year have also had another positive impact on job seeker behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now see that job seekers who have missed an appointment are re-engaging more quickly with their provider. There has been a reduction in the length of payment suspensions by 40 per cent. Between September 2014 and March 2015 the average payment suspension duration fell from 5.2 to 3.1 business days. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The faster engagement is good news for both job seekers and providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The no show no pay changes introduced last year work because they do two things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, in the event of non-compliance they allow a person's income support payment to be immediately suspended until the person actually does what is asked of them, such as attend an appointment. This provides a highly effective prompt for people to reconnect quickly with their provider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And secondly, the changes provide a stronger and more immediate link for the job seeker between the non-compliant action and any financial penalties. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the very positive impact these changes have had on job seeker behaviour to date, the government is seeking to apply the same principles to other mutual obligation requirements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has long been a feature of our social security system that unemployed people in receipt of certain income support paymentsâ€”such as Newstart allowanceâ€”are asked to do certain activities in return for that taxpayer funded benefit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the first things job seekers are required to do is to enter into a job plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A job planâ€”which is referred to as an employment pathway plan in the legislationâ€”lists the activities that a job seeker must do in return for their income support such as looking for work, attending appointments and participating in activities like training or Work for the Dole. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The job plan must take into account the job seeker's individual circumstances and their ability to comply with its requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, some job seekers are failing to meet this fundamental requirement by refusing to enter into a job plan. These job seekers are essentially saying to the taxpayer, 'I will take your money but don't expect anything in return from me.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No worker would be able to demand that of an employerâ€”so why should a job seeker be able to demand that of the taxpayer?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This behaviour flies in the face of the principle of mutual obligationâ€”which is a principle that has long enjoyed bipartisan support in this place. As a matter of principle, the same standards of behaviour that are expected of employees in the workplace should be expected of job seekers in receipt of taxpayer funded benefits such as income support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At present, there are no financial consequences for an initial refusal to enter into a job plan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will reinforce the importance of the job plan by introducing a payment suspension that will apply until the job seeker accepts their plan. If the person does not have a good reason for refusing to enter into a job plan they may incur a financial penalty each day until they accept their plan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have seen with the no show no pay changes introduced last year, payment suspension at the point of non-compliance sends an effective early signal to the job seeker that something is not right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It allows the job seeker to quickly respond and rectify the situation through positive action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the application of possible financial penalties for those people who do not have a reasonable excuse for their failure helps to maintain public confidence and trust in our social security system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The existing current safeguards in the system will ensure that no-one is penalised for refusing to enter a job plan if they have a genuine excuse for their failure to comply or it is unreasonable in terms of what is required within the plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After a job plan is agreed, as well as attending regular appointments with their employment services provider, job seekers are often required to attend appointments with organisations such as training providers or a Work for the Dole host organisation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The services provided at these appointments are funded by the taxpayers to help job seekers improve their prospects of moving from welfare into paid work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, some job seekers are treating these service providers with contempt by not behaving appropriately at relevant appointments. This would not be acceptable behaviour in the workplace. An employee who misbehaves at work and fails to participate would not be paid by their employer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why should a job seeker who misbehaves and fails to participate at an appointment receive a taxpayer funded income support payment for their actions? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides that if a job seeker acts in an inappropriate manner during an appointmentâ€”such that the purpose of the appointment is not achievedâ€”a job seeker's participation payment may not be payable until the job seeker attends a new appointment and participates appropriately. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, if the job seeker does not have a reasonable excuse for acting in an inappropriate manner during the appointment, a penalty amount would be able to be deducted from the job seeker's participation payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, these changes mirror the successful no show no pay principles introduced last year and would bring the treatment of inappropriate behaviour at an appointment in line with the existing treatment of inappropriate behaviour at an activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As mentioned, job seekers are required to attend appointments with organisations other than their employment service provider such as training providers or Work for the Dole host organisations. These missed appointments cost these organisations time and money. It therefore makes sense to apply the same successful process used for employment provider appointments for all appointment types.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Accordingly, as a matter of practice, from 1 July 2016 job seekers who deliberately miss appointments with specialist service providers without good reason may also incur a financial penalty for each day until they re-engage with their employment service provider. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will create a stronger incentive for job seekers to attend these appointments and ensure job seekers are getting the support that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to attendance at appointments, it has been a longstanding feature of our social security system that job seekers are asked to participate in certain activitiesâ€”like training or Work for the Dole. Currently, it can take up to five weeks for a financial penalty to be applied after a job seeker misses an activity or job interview. This is too long and makes the penalty less effective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will remedy this by providing that job seekers who do not attend activitiesâ€”and do not have a reasonable excuse for their failure to attendâ€”will have their penalties deducted from their next fortnightly payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, this change applies the same principles as in the bill last year to establish a more immediate link between a non-compliant action and its financial consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking for work is the most important part of a job seeker's mutual obligation requirements, and gives the job seeker the best chance of getting off income support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this, job seekers who currently do not make an adequate effort to look for work rarely face penalties because the current system is too slow and ineffective. Currently, it takes months of inadequate job search efforts before a job seeker faces any real payment consequence. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will change that process so that job seekers who do not undertake adequate job search efforts without good reason will have their payment immediately suspended until they demonstrate adequate job search efforts. The longer the job seeker delays completing their job search, the longer their payment is delayed, whereas meeting the requirement will result in immediate and full back payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to mutual obligation requirements outlined so far, it is a fundamental requirement of our social security system that job seekers must accept the offer of a suitable job when it is made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an important principle that a person in receipt of benefitsâ€”and receiving help through employment servicesâ€”has an absolute obligation to accept suitable work when it is available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This principle reflects the fact that Australia's income support system is there as a safety net for people who genuinely cannot find a job, as opposed to an option for those who simply refuse to work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a justifiable concern in the community that some people in receipt of benefits are able to refuse a suitable job with impunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the current compliance arrangements an eight-week non-payment penalty can be applied to job seekers who refuse work without good reason, or who fail to start a job as planned. Unfortunately, amendments introduced by the previous government mean that job seekers can have this penalty completely waived just by agreeing to undertake some extra activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The data indicates that job seekers are increasingly taking advantage of the waiver provisions to remain on income support rather than accepting a suitable job. In 2009-10, when the waiver provisions were introduced, only 45 per cent of penalties for refusing a suitable job were waived and 55 per cent were served by the job seeker. By comparison, in 2013-14, 78 per cent of penalties for refusing a suitable job were waived.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that these penalties no longer provide an adequate deterrent to refusing work, because job seekers know they are able to return to payment with virtually no consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rememberâ€”these people are turning down jobs that they are capable of doingâ€”not jobs beyond their skill set or jobs which would pose a risk to their health and safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reasons given by job seekers for these refusals are not acceptable. They include reasons such as that the job interfered with their holiday plans, or that the work was beneath them, or that it would take too much effort, or that they would rather stay on unemployment benefits. It is unacceptable that job seekers who are clearly able to work can turn down a genuine work offer without experiencing an actual penalty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the examples I have just given show, some job seekers are unfortunately only too ready to exploit these provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will remove the waivers so that all job seekers who refuse an offer of suitable work without an acceptable excuse will serve an eight-week non-payment period. This change will ensure that job seekers face immediate and real consequences for turning down the offer of work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what taxpayers expect. They expect the government to maintain the integrity of the social security system and ensure it remains as a safety net for people in genuine need. It is not fair to ask those people who make the effort to go to work and pay their taxes to support those who could clearly work but prefer to collect welfare instead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Often when there are changes proposed to the job seeker compliance system there is a justifiable concern about the potential impact on certain groups of job seekers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to assure the House that this bill will retain all current safeguards that are designed to ensure that vulnerable job seekers do not incur any financial penalties inappropriately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Job seekers with identified vulnerabilities will continue to be flagged on the IT systems used by the Department of Human Services and employment service providers. And as is now the case, job seekers who give prior notice of a reasonable excuse will not have the payment suspension or penalties applied. This means the penalties will not impact on those whose failure to meet a requirement is beyond their controlâ€”for instance, where they have taken ill or had an unexpected caring commitment and, where reasonable, gave prior notice of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, employment service providers will still have the discretion not to report a failure to Human Services but to use other servicing strategies to re-engage job seekers instead. All decisions involving financial penalties will continue to be made by the Department of Human Services, and if a job seeker is not happy with the outcome they have the option of appealing the decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government is committed to building a more efficient and effective employment services system that helps more job seekers into work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note there has been complaint from some quarters about the funding provided by the government for the changes in this bill. Let me put this in context: the government is spending $6.8 billion over four years to help job seekers into work through jobactive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $24.5 million provided for the measures in this bill is a very small but important investment to maintain the overall integrity of the social security and employment services systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very important to remember that noncompliance by job seekers does come at a cost. It costs the provider organisations in terms of red tape and down time, it costs the job seeker in terms of lost opportunities and benefits and it costs the taxpayer in terms of the overall welfare bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government is committed to ensuring the integrity of our income support system so that it is affordable and sustainable over the long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to do this we need a stronger, more streamlined job seeker compliance framework that includes appropriate incentives and sanctions for job seekers who fail to meet their mutual obligation requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill builds on the successful changes made in 2014-15 by further strengthening the compliance framework to drive a more widespread change in job seeker behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the support of those opposite for these reforms last year. These changes were built on their reforms of 2011, which we also supported at that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to further support from those opposite to complete this process to create a more effective job seeker compliance framework, and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

If you are the teachers, the nurses and the doctors working in regional Australia, helping the people working in regional Australia, this change is for you.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you are the union members of any stripe, I say to you this: the Labor Party are interested in your membership fees; they are not interested in your long-term employment. If they were, they would be supporting this change, because the Greens have publicly stated:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, every time you see a political ad from the Greens, it is not about the environment. If it were, they would be talking about matters which are doing enormous damage to our flora and fauna: the feral cats that are wiping out entire species; the feral dogs that are destroying livestock for fun, not for food; the feral pigs that are eating to extinction our sea turtle eggs and hatchlings and, in my region, the loggerhead turtles. They are turtles which nest in only two locations in the world, one of them Mon Repos beach, right in the middle of my electorate.</span>

It is this government that is allocating money to control feral pigs, to control feral cats and to control wild dogs. When the Greens speak about the Great Barrier Reef or Queensland ports, know that they speak with a forked tongue, because the Greens' aimâ€”the Greens' only aimâ€”is to ensure that Australians do not have a job. That is because the Greens' goal is to destroy industry. The Greens' goal is to close Queensland ports.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:39</span>):  I rise to speak on this amendment bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Standing) Bill 2015, because, as a former resource industry executive and as a former resources minister, I believe that how we regulate, how we manage and how at law we provide rights to developers, to conservationists and to communities are extremely important, and the EPBC Act is legislation that has stood the test of time. Good, objective based environmental legislation is an enabler, not a disabler, of investment decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this act, in the course of the previous government, we saw in excess of $280 billion worth of investment in our resources sector alone. There was investment on Curtis Island that saw the development of LNG export facilities in the previous speaker's own area. We saw the development of coalmines through Queensland and of gasification, of gas from coal seams, and we have seen the development of massive new export LNG facilities through northern Australia and Western Australia. Iron ore production alone will have gone from 100 million tonnes in the year 2000 to in excess of 800 million tonnes per year from next year. That was all done with the EPBC Act in place.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why were we able to do that? We were able to do that for seven simple reasons, and these reasons were known to the framers and the creators of that legislation. The framers and creators of that legislation were of course the Howard government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The EPBC Act creates certainty. It creates certainty for consumers. It creates certainty for investors. It creates certainty for communities. And it creates certainty for environmentalists. It creates certainty because, within the operation of the EPBC Act, there is a process which allows for proper, rigorous testing of arguments and propositions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an open act. People can see how this act is being implemented by Commonwealth departments and by those agencies in states that operate under the delegated authorities from the EPBC Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is transparent. Transparency is a critical element in environmental approvals, and the transparency that is available to communities to see where an approval is and why an approval is is extremely important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is practical. It allows for proponents of projects and opponents of projects to argue their case. It allows science to be brought into judgement, and it allows arguments about the economic value of propositions to be taken into account, in the knowledge of environmental costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is flexible, because it operates in every Australian jurisdiction, onshore and offshore, whether it be a coalmine, an iron ore mine or an oil or gas field.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is efficient. We have seen thousands of decisions made in the short 15 years of the action of this act that have seen the approval of some of the biggest resource projects not simply in the history of our nation but in the world. The close to $80 billion currently being invested on Barrow Island, in Western Australia, by Chevron as the operator of the Gorgon Project is seeing the world's largest single-point resource investment made on decisions that were structured and carefully tuned under the EPBC Act: decisions that protect the turtles, decisions that protect the seagrass, decisions that protect an A-class nature reserve. They are decisions of which we can all be proud. Most importantly, they are decisions which have allowed the world's first and the world's largest commercial carbon dioxide geosequestration project as part of the Barrow Island Gorgon Project. That is something of which both sides in this parliament should be deeply proud. This is a project whose approval began through this system under the Howard government and was concluded under the Rudd and Gillard governments, and the first exports of LNG from that project will occur under the Abbott government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My word, we should be simply proud of how this act works. We should be seeing these successes as demonstrations that good environmental legislation allows us to create approvals in which communities can have confidence and in which investors can have great confidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The EPBC Act has a seventh component which I regard as being extremely important in environmental legislation, and that is completeness. When you have an EPBC Act approval, you know it has been through a rigorous testing process. That is why we have seen over $280 billion of resource investment across our country in every jurisdiction and in every mineral category supporting our exports, supporting our jobs and supporting the best possible environmental decisions. At this time, we see a lot of public contestability around the efficacy of coal exports. I have no compunction in standing in this place and in any community in our country to support our coal mining industry, coal exports, the development of coal mines, the use of coal for energy generation and coal chemistry, so that we can extract the value of coal for the value of current and future generations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Adani mineâ€”the Carmichael mineâ€”became contentious as a consequence of a set of administrative procedures that had taken place through the Minister for the Environment's portfolio and of management that placed a conclusive decision in the context of Adani at risk. Quite properly, the minister and Adaniâ€”the government and Adaniâ€”reached an agreement as to what to do next. That agreement was really simple: let's restart the process, let's spend a few weeks just stopping the clock and restarting the process. I do not join with those journalists who have been, I think, caustically unfair about the judgement that descends on the environment minister, Minister Hunt, as a consequence of that. Indeed, I read one opinion in a weekend paper that said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the recent Carmichael decision in the courts, delaying the project, highlights â€¦ gross incompetence by a ministerial officeâ€¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not believe the administrative law shortcoming in this process demonstrates incompetence in the ministerial office at all. This is a complex act; it is hard to administer. Peopleâ€”individuals and environmental groupsâ€”have rights and they exercise those rights. In so doing, an administrative flaw was detected that is not fatal and does not damage the integrity of the Carmichael mine. So, with consent, the project proponents and the government stopped the clock and restarted the process. I would expect to see that process restarted within weeks and I hope that it is able to approve that mine. But, of course, that decision is in the hands of the minister, as it should be under this act. It is in the hands of the government and, effectively, it is a decision that will be made on the basis of the best scientific evidence, the best possible advice and in consideration of all the documentation available to the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a complex act. I can recall when, in the previous government, a decision was made on a small magnetite mine in Tasmania. When I say small, in the context of our overall iron ore exports this was a very, very tiny mine. But a small administrative flaw placed the Shree approval at risk. As a consequence, the Shree mine had to be reconsidered, documents needed to be cited and an approval could not be properly given until the clock, on that occasion, had been appropriately stopped and then restarted. These things happen; they are not fatal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I stress again, in the course of the last seven or eight years we have seen almost $300 billion, in resource investments alone, approved under the EPBC Act. Let us not weaken this act through this amendment, which removes third party appeal rights. We do not need to weaken it, because the best environmental regulation is strong environmental regulation. It is regulation which allows third parties to offer their view, which allows good science to be brought to bear and which is transparent and ultimately complete in its capacity to make decisions and recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am reminded that the threat of third-party appeals does, of course, create a stronger incentive for proponents and governments to adhere to the black letter law of approvals. That is a good thing. It is a good thing because it improves the quality of environmental assessments of major projects. It is not the actual exercise of the power to enforce public rights that matters most, but actually the threat that they will be exercised that brings improved accountability to an approval system that can be plagued by vested interests. I am not naive. I know that environmental activists target the weaknesses and the complexities in this legislation in order to slow down and, where they can, prevent projects. But only a fool would suggest that removing those rights makes this legislation better; it does not. We need to accept that, in our contested world, there are heartfelt views and, on occasions, good science that needs to be brought to the attention of regulators and decision makers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also be minded that, since the EPBC Act commenced in July 2000, nearly 6,000 projects have been processed through the EPBC Act. It says 5,500 on the statistics available to me here. Of these, there have been 33 Federal Court challenges by third parties against only 22 projects. When we look at how those challenges occur, it is worth having in mind that just recently, in the last couple of days, we have seen a decision in the context of another very significant coal mine, a very significant coal mine indeed. That is, the Alpha coal mine in Queensland. As we read in our weekend papers, the Indian company, GDK's, proposed $6 billion Alpha coal mine has survived a legal challenge by environmentalists, clearing another hurdle for the development of the minerals-rich Galilee Basin. That was the headline in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Weekend Australian</span> newspaper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at this in its context. Conservationists challenge an approvals process. A judgement is made that clearly determines that that challenge was both vexatious and without foundation. As a consequence, costs are awarded against the conservationists. Good, because this is the moral hazard that the conservationists and activists run when they take actions which are purely vexatious.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we have good science and good environmental regulation, we know that we can approve a good thermal coal mine that will generate jobs, most importantly generate coal that will fire power stations that will drive electricity generation that will allow communities in China, in India, in North Asia to thrive. It will allow lights to be lit, food to be cooked, food to be kept cold and communities to operate around our North Asian region as a consequence of our very good, well approved coal mines, coal mines that have a life of 20, 30 even 40 years, coal mines that will be in existence, generating a project and product onto the global marketplace, which will increase living standards not just in Australia but in our region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree with the sentiment of this House that coal mining is not just a good activity and an essential activity to put good clean coal onto the world market to support both our exports but most importantly to support the living standards of people in our North Asian region. To allow us to do that, we need the best environmental approvals process that we can design. As a generation of legislators and parliamentarians, we are blessed in that the design of this act has been done for us. It was done by Robert Hill, it was done by Prime Minister Howard, it was done in a previous parliament and we should not compromise it for the sake of short-term political gain. I think this is a bad amendment and I cannot support it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:54</span>):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Standing) Bill 2015. Over two years ago we were elected, amongst mandates, to: create safer borders; fix our country's budget black hole; provide certainty to small businesses; and provide a clear direction, a strong direction in relation to our policy related to the environment. The Australian people voted the coalition in on these mandates amongst many others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems timely today that I am here to speak on the environmental protection and biodiversity conservation amendment or the EPBC Act. Our nation has some of the most enduring and stringent environmental laws worldwide and these laws deserve to be respected; they deserve to be observed, not subject to legal sabotage. Let me reassure the House and the people out there that farmers, landowners and any other person whose interests are adversely affected by the decision will continue to have a right to appeal any decision. It is their right as a party who carries a vested interest. For clarity, I want to repeat that: farmers, landowners any other person whose interests are adversely affected by the decision will continue to have the right to appeal any decision. That is what we are enshrining.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the environmental groups, those vandals out there who seek to stop any progress, will still have ample opportunity to put forward their evidence and make their case through our rigorous environmental impact assessment process. I am concerned by some of the objectives of those green groups. I want to quote from the Greenpeace Australia report titled: <span style="font-style:italic;">Stopping the Australian Coal Export Boom</span>. It says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our strategy is to 'disrupt and delay' key projects and infrastructure while gradually eroding public and political support for the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further it goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Legal challenges can stop projects outright or can delay them â€¦ to buy time to build a much stronger movement and powerful public campaigns. They can also expose the impacts, increase costs (and) raise investor uncertainty and create a powerful platform for public campaigning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government, we had a clear mandate prior to the 2013 election to restore confidence to the Australian people and in particular to those that want to invest in jobs, growth and opportunity for this nation. We as a government have made a decision to protect Australian jobs by removing from the EPBC Act the provision that allows radical green activists to engage in vigilante litigation to stop important economic projects. Section 487 of the EPBC Act is a red carpet for radical activists who have a political but not a legal interest in a development to use aggressive litigation tactics to disrupt and sabotage important projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was astounded to hear the member for Newcastle earlier make commentary in response to these vigilante court cases in saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This red carpet is hardly worn, I would suggest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would respectfully suggest that the member for Newcastle is incredibly misguided. Radical Greens have begun an emerging trend and are using our Australian court system to sabotage economic projects, sacrificing tens of thousands of Australian  jobs in the processâ€”people that would have been the union movement, working in many of those jobs. So she cannot even support her own union membership in the jobs that would be provided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will repeal this provision to return law to the usual position, where somebody with a legitimate interest in commencing a legal action has the standing to do so but somebody who really wants to prosecute a political cause does not. This will take away the congestion from our court system, which is already under significant pressure and lengthy delays. Further pressures from radical groups trying to draw out the process is not appreciated. These ideological groups pose a great threat to our court processes, generating costly delays to our system and also posing a threat to the jobs in our nation. So on one hand we have the Labor opposition talking about the unemployment rate and how the government needs to do something about it and then on the other hand Labor is opposing this legislation which will help streamline and create jobs for those very Australians they purport to stand up for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These green activists I speak of themselves have declared that this is their objectiveâ€”to use the courts not for the proper purpose of resolving a dispute between citizens but for the political purpose of bringing developments to a standstill. Green activists, in their document <span style="font-style:italic;">Stopping the Australian coal export boom</span>, declare a strategy to delay, to disrupt and to reduce the financial viability of key infrastructure projects, including ports, rail and mines, through litigation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an area that has created significant contention in the Hunter region recently. I would like to cite the Newcastle City Council making a decision just two weeks ago to move its investments away from financial institutions who invest in the coal industry. Might I add that the predominantly Labor Newcastle City Council's decision to do this was idealistically spearheaded by Labor Councillor Declan Clausen. Declan Clausen has shown that he is not only wet behind the ears; he is also green between them. Mr Clausen acknowledged that the Port of Newcastle is the world's largest coal-exporting port and that it was 'important that the city looked at diversifying its economy'. He also said that the coal industry in New South Wales 'understands the writing is on the wall' and that 'coal is not going to be a leader long into the future' and he suggested that clean technology could in part replace coal's economic contribution. That is logicalâ€”let's draw investment away from the industry that props up the city and is the main engine room of the Hunter Valley! The actions of the Newcastle City Council and Declan Clausen are so misguided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To provide a level of context to the House: the Port of Newcastle has 216 years of history in shipping. The port operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and, in 2014 alone, it exported 159 million tonnes of coal. The New South Wales Minerals Council foundâ€”in research that was independently peer reviewed by the Centre for Small Business and Regional Research at the University of Wollongongâ€”that mining in the Hunter region accounts for $5.9 billion of direct expenditure, employing 11,078 employees, many of them union members. The direct contribution to the local economies included paying $1.5 billion in salaries for the most recent published year, 2013-14. Mining in the Hunter directly supports 4,328 businesses, many of them small businesses. In 2013-14â€”the latest available dataâ€”mining in the Hunter contributed $21.1 million to local councils, including Newcastle City Council. In a 2011 report, the number of persons employed at the Port of Newcastle was listed at 6,927 in the direct port precinct. A further 597 were listed as in direct port related jobs. Transport and warehousing jobs associated with the port had 1,293 workers, and jobs listed in the 'buffer zone' totalled 30,744. These are jobs that reflect on the activities connected to the port. This port is so integral and coal is so integral to our economy. The Prime Minister recently made commentary on the decision of Newcastle City Council, asking: 'Why is a coal city moving away from coal investment?' I echo the Prime Minister's thoughts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party are trying to undermine Australia's coal industry at its core, and the Labor politicians in the Hunter region, at local, state and federal level, are no different. I refer to the comments of the Labor shadow environment minister, Mark Butler, in November 2014 in relation to the question of phasing out the coal industry. He said, on ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Adelaide Breakfast</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Yes. I think everyone agrees that over a period of timeâ€”it will be a fairly extended period of timeâ€”we'll move to more renewable energy sources.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is one thing for the economically reckless Greens to advocate the end of one of our most significant industries, with little thought for the economic costs to Australian jobs, but it is quite another thing for the Labor Party to do the same. The Hunter Labor members have an agenda to support the demise of an industry that has upheld the standards of living in the Hunter for decades. I recently called on the Labor member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon, to clarify comments he made on 27 August in support of Newcastle City Council's decision to move its investments away from the coal industry. I find it interesting that the member for Hunter felt confident enough to write to the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Newcastle Herald</span> on 29 August that 'we should insist that the council rescind its decision'. It would appear that the member for Hunter has had a drastic change of heart. On 27 August, in an interview with ABC 1233's Paul Bevan, Newcastle City Council Lord Mayor Nuatali Nelmes said that the council's decision 'is not directly related to our coal industry', to which Mr Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter, replied, 'Well, I've listened to the Lord Mayor, and she makes a lot of sense of course and Nuatali has done much to sort of clarify what the council did last night.' </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hunter needs to clarify, in the light of his comments, what makes sense to him in relation to Newcastle council moving its investments away from our coal industry. I call on the member for Hunter to outline what prior contact he had with council, a large majority of whom are his Labor colleagues. Did the member for Hunter make any attempt to persuade his colleagues to stop this from happening? I would also like the Newcastle Lord Mayor to answer in detail how isolating major banks due to their investment in fossil fuel is 'not at all related to the coal industry'. In relation to Lord Mayor's comments that 'lots of companies around the world are doing it', on 27 August 2015 on ABC Newcastle, I am quite certain that most companies and councils around the world would think twice before isolating the largest revenue-making industry within their local government area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party are not serious about jobs in the Hunter, both indirect and direct mining jobs. The ALP are not serious about the small businesses in the Hunter, many of whom rely on the coal industry to survive. Where do the member for Newcastle, the member for Charlton and the member for Shortland stand on this issue? Mining and mining support industries are big employers in their respective electorates. How would Newcastle City Council itself feel if the banks diverted their lending and investment portfolio away from Newcastle? With a record export month for coal out of the Port of Newcastle last financial year, this industry has proven that it can have a long and enduring future in our region. Without doubt, it is backbone of the local economy. In times of investment uncertainty, it does not need its political leaders at local government, state and federal levels undermining that confidence. The member for Hunter and the Labor politicians are doing their best to try to distance themselves from this debate, but I know the undue amount of influence the Labor Greens coalition have over the member for Hunter and his policy decisions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government we seek to bring certainty to our nation, to the court processes and of course with our environment policies. I am particularly passionate about this piece of legislation due to my responsibilities as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and because my electorate of Paterson is impacted so directly by the attacks on the coal industry. This is a government that has to ensure some of the toughest and most effective environmental laws in the world are upheld. We are protecting the Great Barrier Reef, building a generation of environmental enthusiasts with the Green Army and implementing unprecedented water reform in the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Hunt introduced this legislation to ensure that environmental activists no longer receive special treatment under the EPBC Act. Let me be clear that the proposed amendments do not change environmental standards. This legislation makes sense because it brings the EPBC Act into line with other Commonwealth laws. Farmers, landowners and any other person whose interests are adversely affected by the decision will continue to have the right to appeal any decision. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to create certainty for business. Under this government, Australia is open for business and part of that is removing uncertainty for investors by halving the time for approvals and clearing Labor's backlog of approvals, and by approving over one trillion dollars in project approvals. Does Labor really want to support green activist groups who cost jobs of their union members and delay critical investment? I call on the Labor Party to support this sound legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  I join other Labor members in rising in opposition to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Standing) Bill 2015. This is a small amendment but one which carries far-reaching consequences, directly in terms of our capacity to protect our precious natural environment but more broadly in terms of the strength of our civil society and, indeed, our democracy. In this bill, I think, we see a real narrowing in terms of important legal rights, the rights to seek judicial review on important matters of broad public significance, and a narrowing of our sense of our collective capacity. That was evident in the contribution of the parliamentary secretary who spoke before me in this debate, a contribution which did not address any of the important questions of principle or the practical consequences of the legislation that is before this House. It is telling as we consider this legislation that it speaks to a government that is always looking for someone else to blame. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through all the contributions of government members, we have heard much talk about jobs, this from a government that has pushed the unemployment queues to beyond 800,000 for the first time in 20 years, this from a government that has no plan for jobs, this from a government which fails to address the evidence base underpinning the assertions they have made regarding the impact of the legislation that is before us on jobs. That is unsurprising because it is a complete red herring. This is a government that is not interested in evidence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here, today, we are discussing the removal of a provision that has served Australia well, a provision introduced by that well-known green vigilante, former Prime Minister John Howard and his government. Section 487 of the EPBC Act has effectively balanced interests of landowners, those seeking to develop land and exploit its resources, and the wider communityâ€”the present generation and future generations who deserve to inherit the same beautiful and pristine environment that we enjoy today. The provision recognises that there is such a thing as civil society and this is a good and, indeed, a vital thing, which makes the language of government members in this debate and in their public contributions around it so very troubling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It really is extraordinary that government members seem to believe that it is as a matter of principle somehow wrong to act in interests other than narrow economic self-interest. Activism, community involvement, as we speak about so often in this place in other contexts, are of course good things. It is part of the bedrock of a healthy society and it is fundamental to a functioning democracy. Again, the language of this debate is something that we should have regard to, particularly given some of the other challenges we are working our way through on behalf of the nation in the parliament at the moment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is it helpful to characterise public interest litigation as 'lawfare'? Is it helpful to defame people acting on behalf of the environment as vigilante green activists and to talk about conspiracies? Is it helpful to talk about throwing grenades in this context? I do not think it is; it gets in the way of a debate about getting this balance rightâ€”balancing these interests. I think it is also worth reflecting on how the legislation we are debating today came before this parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill which would amend the EPBC Act to repeal 487 of that act, which presently extends the meaning of a person aggrieved in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. This bill is a clear attempt to restrict the ability of community members seeking to review the legality of decisions which are in the public interestâ€”seeking to uphold the law, seeking to uphold the world's toughest environmental protections, as the parliamentary secretary spoke of earlier, and indeed that was a matter that the minister spoke of in his second readingâ€”his rather disingenuous second reading. The effect of this short amendment would be profound. The amendment would not only impact the credibility of Australia's environmental policy that restricts citizens from questioning government decisions by judicial review; it also, like many other policies of this government, shows a clear divergence from contemporary attitudes towards environmental protection right across our society. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So how did this amendment come before the parliament? Clearly, there is no debate. It is a reaction to the government's embarrassing, flawed and ultimately failed approval process for the Adani mine, which, of course, is all about a major error on the part of the government, identified via litigation properly brought under this provision via proper standing arrangements, enabling these issues to be ventilated before the courts and enabling a process to be dealt with on procedural groundsâ€”via consent orders, ultimately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After 15 years of successful operation of this provision, we now have this amendment before us, which reflects the minister's attempt to bypass a legitimate democratic process. Not only is the amendment in reaction to this decision but, to my mind and to any fair reading, it contravenes the intention and object of the original legislation, despite what the minister has suggested.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is useful to reflect on the debate in 1998, as the present legislation made its way through the parliament. The EPBC Act is, of course, the central national piece of environmental legislation. It provides, critically, a legal framework to protect and manage national and internationally important flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places. This act has been the overriding legislative embodiment of environmental protection throughout this millennium, including through the mining boom. It is pretty clear that its existence, including the provisions in respect of the extended standing for judicial review, has posed no problem for the economy or job creationâ€”quite the reverse. We have seen the approval of many thousands of projects worth billions of dollars of investment under the Howard government and the Rudd and Gillard governments. The legislation has been tried and tested. The standing provision was initially implemented to overcome the problem of groups with legitimate public interest and legitimate environmental interest being unable to bring actions on behalf of affected communities if not directly in the communities themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a matter canvassed in a very detailed report of a Senate committee in 1998. I think it is worth members participating in this debate reflecting on the work of that Senate committee in its report on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 and the Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1999. This committee was chaired by Senator Eggleston and was comprised of a majority of coalition members. This committee wholeheartedly endorsed a set clause, 485, which subsequently was enacted as section 487, which extended the meaning of the term 'person aggrieved' within the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. The report stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee does not agree with the claims that the standing provisions will 'open the floodgates' of litigation. The Committee notes that the standing provisions under the Bill are consistent with those already provided in existing Commonwealth environmental legislation, such as the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1996. As such, this approach to standing has already been successfully used by the Commonwealth and does not represent a radical departure from current legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a matter that government members should have regard to. It is very difficult to see a similar evidence baseâ€”a similar detailed process of inquiry that took place in 1998â€”evidenced in the bill before us, particularly having listened to some of the contributions from government legislators, which have been very heavy on rhetoric and very light on evidence. Perhaps that is not unusual and perhaps expecting more is expecting a bit too much in this place under this government. It is important to note also that the committee further noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the standing provisions of the Bill reach a fair balance between enabling public involvement in enforcement of the Bill and ensuring that decisions under the Bill are not unnecessarily delayed or impeded by vexatious litigation. The Bill also provides certainty as to which persons have standing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this gets to the nub of the debate we should be having around these issues. It is about striking an appropriate balance and providing certainty; this should not be a false debate involving rhetorical attacks on the motives of individuals and groups. The consequences simply are not there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge government members to look at the work of their coalition colleagues in 1998, when they had a very detailed look at the matters underpinning this legislation. I remind them, as I referred to earlier, that this extended standing approach is not unique to the legislation we are debating now. It has also effectively been used in other forms of Commonwealth environmental legislation. When we go to the question of the evidence, it is important to noteâ€”despite some of the hysteria which has characterised the debateâ€”that, since the commencement of the EPBC Act, there have been about 30 actions brought in the Federal Court by third parties who have challenged environmental impact assessment processes under the provisions of the act, hardly an overly burdensome number. The removal of section 487 extended standing provision has to be seen in that context and through also having regard to the balancing of the important principle of holding decisions of government to proper scrutiny, as we have seen most recently in the litigation which has caused this debate to come before the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would limit standing to persons whose interests are adversely affected by the decision, based on federal administrative law. The extent of this standing is obviously much less certain than that previously provided for, which seems clearly to go against some of the rhetorical posturing of government members. There is, of course, a very strong public policy rationale for retaining these sorts of broad standing provisions for judicial review. Open standing and access to justice has a wide variety of benefits in maintaining adequate checks on government as well as clear avenues for effective enforcement of environmental laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all have a responsibility in this place to ensure that the responsibility for the environment in which we live does not simply lie with those persons directly affected. This is clearly an intergenerational responsibility. Those opposite do like to lecture us on this side about intergenerational responsibility. There is no more profound intergenerational responsibility for those of us here now than to think about the quality of the natural environment we are going to leave for those who come after us. This is a collective responsibility. It is not only in the hands of those in executive government. It is not only in the hands of those who sit in this legislature. It is a responsibility that should extend to interested persons in the wider community acting properly. That has been the effect of section 487 over the past 15 years. It should continue to be so. Within these existing legal frameworks, it is evident that our broad civic responsibility to question government decision making on environmental protection needs to continue to be accommodated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that the existing standing provisionsâ€”in fact, it is most evident through the contributions of government members that this has been borne outâ€”have not attracted a negative response from the sector or the legal system. Since the commencement of the act, I note that there have been several reviews looking at its effectiveness. These reviews have supported extended standing provisions for judicial review in the EPBC Act. I note that very recently the Productivity Commission conducted a wide review of this. It looked at major projects rather than the act at large, but this review concluded:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ there is a public interest in allowing third parties to bring judicial review applications, as it allows the legality of the process to be enforced, providing an important 'safety valve' in the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it does, and it should continue to be so. This work of the Productivity Commission, hardly a green vigilante group on these questions, provided again a very useful overview of the operation of our present environmental regulations in terms of major project approvals. It gives them a big tick, basically. It looks at the evidence, something members of this government are allergic to. It also looks again at the balancing that we are required to doâ€”the balancing of the broad public policy objectives. It is very clear that we cannot simply tilt the balance in favour of this executive, or any executive. The public policy grounds for retaining section 487 in its present form and providing for the current certainty around extended standing for judicial review are clear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This House should reject the bill that is before it, because the government has not made the case for change. It should reject the bill, because we should in this place stand up for the environment today and for the environment tomorrow. But we should also be rejecting this bill because its introduction would strike a deep blow into the effective operation of our democracy through inhibiting the operation of civil society actors to hold government decision making effectively to account. I urge government members to go back to 1998 and review the Senate committee. I urge government members to go back to 2013 and look at the work of the Productivity Commission. I urge government members to bring evidence and principle to this debate and to reject this legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Nationals Deputy Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Standing) Bill 2015. This bill amends the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 by repealing section 487. Section 487 has the effect of extending the definition of an aggrieved person which is outlined in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. The original act outlines the conditions under which someone may apply for a review of an administrative decision. These conditions specify that 'a person who is aggrieved by a decision' may apply to the Federal Court or the Federal Circuit Court for an order of review. The act specifies that a person who is aggrieved is someone 'whose interests are adversely affected by the decision'. That is the test that applies across a very wide range of administrative decisions. But section 487 of the EPBC Act opens the door for any individual to challenge a decision covered by the act as long as:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ at any time in the 2 years immediately before the decision, failure or conduct, the individual has engaged in a series of activities in Australia or an external Territory for protection or conservation of, or research into, the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The same, I note, applies to organisations. Section 487 specifies that all the terms used in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act have the same meaning in the EPBC Act except 'person aggrieved'. What the extended meaning has done, in practical terms, is open a door for the misuse of Australian law. It opens the door for people and organisations who have absolutely nothing to do with the decision being made or the project being considered, or the decision not being made on the project being considered. It opens the door for people and organisations whose interests are in no way adversely affected. It opens the door to anyone with an axe to grindâ€”any axeâ€”as long as they took notes on their weekly bushwalk. That is what it amounts to. It is an open invitation to extreme greens to use legal warfare, or 'lawfare', in pursuit of their own ideology that has nothing to do with the decision or the matter that is being decide upon.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen in Queensland is an organised campaign by the extreme green movement to do everything they possibly can to shut down the coal industry. The coal industry is a major driver of the Australian economy. It still is, despite there being a downturn, and it was coalâ€”certainly not the Rudd Labor government or the member for Lilleyâ€”together with iron ore that got Australia through the global financial crisis. The state of Queensland would be an economic wreck if these activists were suddenly successful in shutting down the coal industry, but the anti-coal movement pay no attention to any impacts that the pursuit of their ideology may have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some years ago they produced a report and funding proposal to seek investors from the extreme green network, and that report was called <span style="font-style:italic;">Stopping the Australian coal export boom</span>. They unashamedly named their intentions, which, to many thousands of people who rely on the coal industry for jobs, for wealth, for business and for survival, were nothing short of treason. These extremists set about implementing this plan almost word by word and letter by letter. They have targeted, amongst other things, the plans by Adani Australia to build the biggest coalmine in Australia in the Galilee Basin. The plan was for construction of the Carmichael mine, construction of a railway line linking the Carmichael mine and the Galilee Basin with the port of Abbot Point, and the expansion of the port at Abbot Point to cater for new ships coming in to export the coal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These extreme greens have done everything they possibly can to stop that project by frustrating and delaying the approvals process. I have to say there is a long litany of actions by the green movement beyond the legal warfare that I want to update the House on. They effectively inserted activists from outside our regionâ€”people who were very well connected and well trained in professional activismâ€”into the Mackay region and the Whitsundays region. Just as they planned in that document, <span style="font-style:italic;">Stopping the Australian coal export boom</span>, they inserted these activists into the community to create community dissent where previously there was none. Again, this is all outlined in the strategy: the strategy of <span style="font-style:italic;">Stopping the Australian coal export boom</span>. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They have used a campaign of lies and misinformation to try to convince the public that things are terribleâ€”that we are going to mine the reef and stuff like that. The language from organisations like GetUp! about this is that we were going to dump 'toxic sludge' on the reef. There was never any intention to do that. Why would there be? What point is there in that? But these are the kinds of lies that we have heard. They challenged approvals for the port expansion. They tried to use lies to convince various segments of the community that offshore disposal was going to blow up the reef. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only concern they raised about the Abbot Point expansion at that point in time was offshore disposal. Even a Greens candidate said they would be happy with the port being expanded if it was agriculture that was going out, not coal, which showed the hypocrisy in their arguments about the reef. They advocated a change at that point to onshore disposal. The government moved to address concerns out there, which probably were not based too much on science but on a fear that something was going to happen to the reef; we said we would dispose of dredge spoil onshore. Suddenly, there was another reason that the green movement was against it: the Caley Valley wetlands. Now the Caley Valley wetlands has been sorted out, it is just the fact that it is coal. They are just coming out and stating, plain and simple, that it is coal. They are still railing against the project, but they are unclear as to the reason why, apart from it being coal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then they went and challenged the federal government's approval of the Carmichael mine. This is but the latest in a long line of extreme green actions to delay and disrupt this job-creating project. They used the ornamental snake and the yakka skink as reasons to go about this latest delay and disruption exercise. But it was not about the snake, it was not about the skink and it was not about the environment. It is not even about climate change. It is about the coal. The extreme green movement hate the coal, even though this project has the capacity to create hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs in Queensland, particularly in regional Queensland and around the Mackay region. Hundreds of millions of Indians will be lifted out of energy poverty. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the coal does not come out of Galilee Basin, where is it going to come from? They are just going to source it from elsewhere. They are probably going to source it from Indonesia, where there are weaker environmental regulations and lower quality coal with higher ash content, which means higher carbon dioxide emissions when it is burnt. If the green movement really cared about carbon dioxide emissions and really cared about the entire planet and environmental regulation then they would promote this mine ahead of other options because the other options are going to be worse in terms of environmental outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is about shutting down the Australian coal industry, and that is the only aim behind these actionsâ€”an aim that is purely ideological. Is that what we really want in this country? Is that what the EPBC Act was supposed to be for? Was it designed to promote ideological activism? I would say no. I would say also that we are not willing to sacrifice so much for the sake of letting the extreme greens play out their ideological games with this legislation. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say to the House that maybe this argument is going on legally and politically, but let's not forget what is at stake here. Even if there is a reapproval of this project, the extreme green movement will, for the next two years, continue to disrupt and delay this project in court and quite possibly bring this project to an end. I am very worried about that. I am worried for my region. We have workers from Central and North Queensland who are desperately looking for jobsâ€”people who have come out of the mining industry. Adani indicated they wanted to use workers from Mackay, Bowen and regional Queensland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just the other day, I had a longstanding businessâ€”130 years in the Mackay communityâ€”contact me and tell me that they were forced to make some workers redundant because of the downturn in the economy. We have thousands of empty homes throughout the Mackay region and hundreds of empty homes in the Bowen region, and we have this project which could restore some hope and opportunity to the region being held up by this green movement. There is the opportunity of the railway line construction and the operation of that railway line, which could create more jobs and open up more economic opportunity in the town of Bowen, which is dying the death of a thousand cuts right now. There is also the expansion of Abbot Point, which again would facilitate jobs and investment in Bowen and also the Mackay region. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is really about the families in North Queenslandâ€”Mackay, Bowen, Townsville, the Burdekin and the Whitsundaysâ€”who are struggling because of job insecurity, because of family stress, because of family breakdown because they cannot make ends meet and because these jobs are being held up. People are actually killing themselves because they do not see that there is any hope because the green movement are in court litigating against this job-creating project. I say enough is enough. A few North Queenslanders killing themselves in despair does not worry the green movement, but I have to tell you it worries me. We in North Queensland care. The majority of others around the country should care. The people in this chamber should care. We care about people. We should care about jobs. We should care about the revenue that these projects could bring in for the government to provide schools, hospitals, basic care and infrastructure in North Queensland so people can go about living a good life. We should be caring about the things that this project could provideâ€”for example, getting people out of energy poverty, creating new economic opportunities, creating steel and creating windmills for the environment.</span>

None of that is possible without coal and without coalminers. Trying to shut down coal-fired power generation before viable alternatives are in place is not only putting the cart before the horse; it is shooting the horse and believing that it is somehow going to force innovation. Well, the motorcar was not invented because we went out and shot the horses. A return to cave-dwelling under the mistaken belief that that will somehow magically drive the mythically green technology is just lunacy. Without the materials that coal provides, without the electricity that coal provides and without the funding that coal and a functioning economy provide, none of the fairyland that the Greens go on about will ever be possible.

                    </a>  I was on it as of today. But, given that I have made more decisions under this act than any other member of this parliament, I do know something about how it operates and I do know how it can get the balance right between making sure we create jobs and making sure that we protect the environment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concept put in that speech, which has been put in a number of speeches from government members, is that somehow industry is being held back because of constant litigation. Of all the decisions that I made in my time as environment ministerâ€”including decisions that I made with respect to INPEX, Prelude, the Olympic Dam and the Gladstone projectsâ€”only one was successfully challenged. It was successfully challenged at the very end of my time. Mark Butler was the Minister for the Environment by then. The reason for the decision was not that there was anything wrong with the conditions or the reasons; it was that one of the documents that should have been included in the final brief was not included. So the decision was reworked and remade and, within a few weeks, certainty was given to industry again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is extraordinary is that the mistake that was made by the government in the Adani decision was apparently an identical mistake. I personally do not hold the Minister for the Environment responsible. I know how big those briefs areâ€”and, realistically, I want the environment minister to be going methodically through all the conditions. It is a clerical check that would have been done by the department which was clearly done in error. It is probably, if anything, a reminder to the parliament of what can happen if you spread your Public Service too thin. Ordinary checks that need to be made can well be overlooked.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Adani decision could have been fixed in a number of weeks. Instead of just fixing it and providing certainty, the government have talked down confidence in projects in Australia in a bizarre way. They could have talked this up and just said, 'Yes, it is an administrative error in terms of what was included in the final brief and we are going to redo it and the decision will be made again in a few weeks' time,' and Adani would have confidence. Instead, the government sends a message to investors around the world that this is a disaster and we need to change the law and put forward a legal change that is very likely to not end up passing the parliament. This is a complete talking down of jobs, investment, industry and certainty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When people talk about lawfare and about it being a problem that has been brought on by environmental activism, they miss the fact that the orders were not a final judicial decision ruling in favour of the appeal for the environmental movement. The orders were consent orders sought by the Commonwealth. In the Adani case, the Commonwealth realised they had made a decision contrary to law and, having realised that, asked for this decision to be made. The court agreed to the consent orders and, having agreed, the government then said, 'Outrageous! How on earth could this have happened?' The court gave the consent orders that the government asked it to provide and then, having provided those consent orders, the government went on its new level of outrageâ€”because this is a government that knows how to take a fight but does not know how to reach an outcome. It does not know how to reach a solution. The change here is unnecessary. This change is bad for the environment and, ultimately, in a final irony, is bad for industry as wellâ€”and I will work through each of those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, though, I want to comment on some of the rhetoric that we have heard in some of these speeches, where members have said, 'If you are opposing this you are chasing cheap, environmental, green inner-city votes.' I do not know how that relates to Alan Jones. I have got to say there was a period when Alan Jones would praise me on his radio stationâ€”in the last few weeks, I think it is fair to say, that period has ended. But on this one, I am willing to give Alan Jones praise. It is not particularly forthcoming my way these days, but he is completely right: on environmental issues, all Australians have a right to care. If anyone thinks that the only people who have a right to care about the Great Barrier Reef are the people who live next to it, they do not understand what happened when Joh Bjelke-Petersen wanted to drill the Great Barrier Reef. If people think that the only people who will care about Tasmania's forests are people who live in Tasmania, they do not understand that the Tasmanian tourism industry draws people from all around the nation and the world. If people think that the only people who will care about the Daintree Rainforest are the people who live there, they are wrong; or the only people who care about Kakadu are the people who live in the Northern Territory, they are wrong. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all have a right to be proud of Australia's environmental icons. Ultimately, what this legislation seeks to do is create a situation where, if a minister for the environment makes an illegal decision, they want it to be able to stand. That is what this is about. Ultimately, the challenge here is from the government, and what is upsetting them is, if an illegal decision is made by a minister, it could be challenged in a court. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What sort of parliament wants to create a situation where a minister will make decisions under legislation which have been passed by this parliament but make them contrary to that legislation, and we want to make an amendment that says: if they do that, that decision will stand? Very few decisions will be successfully challenged in court. The vast bulk of decisions that I made were challenged in court. One was challenged successfully. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the shift in standing, the reason that the Howard governmentâ€”that radical environmentalist John Howardâ€”included the standing rules that are in the EPBC Act now was for a very good reason: if you do not have the standing provisions, what you end up with is a worse situation. What happens is you get a court case first establishing whether or not the party has standing. You have uncertainty for the project for that entire period. If they end up being given standing, then and only then do you get to the merits of the case. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason the Howard government included this provision in the legislation was to make sure that, if a decision was going to be successfully challenged, it is in everyone's interests that that happen immediately and quickly so you do not have a long period dealing with standing and you get immediately to the merits of the case. If, as in the situation with the Adani case, the government realise that they have got a decision wrong, then they can seek consent orders, have the decision made and get on with making a new decisionâ€”get on with doing it properlyâ€”which they would be able to do with respect to Adani. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How bad did it use to be in terms of uncertainty when you did not have a clear standing provision? The best example is probably the case of Australian Conversation Foundation v Commonwealthâ€”this was way back in the eighties. The decision was made on 30 July 1978. The decision on standing was made on 13 February 1980. So from 1978 to 1980, on something where they ended up not being given standing, there was uncertainty over the project anyway. Since that time, the standing common law principles have become less restrictive. It may well be the case that, in a similar circumstance now, you would end up getting standing. So you get your first two years arguing whether you have got standing and, having got it, you then have the argument about the merits. Potentially, for an investment cycle for a project from the time of an environmental decision to the time of them knowing whether or not it is actually going to go ahead, you could have a period of three years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My view on these issues is that it is in no-one's interest for there to be ongoing uncertainty about a project. Environmental decisions should be made. They should be made properly under the act. Sometimes mistakes and errors will be made by ministers. Sometimes they will be errors for which the minister is fully responsible and sometimes they will be errors which were inadvertent or were new rulings, which were surprising from a court. But whatever that time frame is, you want to know as soon as possible. That is why the Howard government said: 'Let's not waste time with an argument about standing; let's give everyone standing straightawayâ€”all the relevant groups that have already indicated an interest in the region. You can't invent a group after the fact but, if they've already been active and indicated an interest in the region prior to the decision, then they can have standing, and we get straight to the merits of the decision.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the merits of a decision at the moment, we are dealing with cases where the error was inadvertent. But consider if the error had been blatant. Consider if you have an environment minister who knowingly ignores a threatened species. For example, I had objections when I listed in Queensland and New South Wales the koala as a threatened species under this act. Campbell Newman went out and bagged me and different people were very critical of it. If an environment minister was dealing with a development in South-East Queensland and they decided to ignore the impact on the koala, who is going to have standing other than the property developers to be able to definitely take the case? You need to be able to resolve it quickly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If an environment minister knowingly makes an unlawful decision, we cannot have a situation where the only people who might have an interest or standing under the law to take it to court are the very people who want the project to go aheadâ€”unless this parliament is going to make a decision today and in this bill we think it is okay for a environment minister to act unlawfully. There is no doubt the proponent will always have standing, so if an illegal decision is made by an environment minister, the proponent will always be good with that. This legislation seeks to narrow whether or not anyone would be able to challenge it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this occasion we are talking about the Adani mine and a particular decision where the error was not in the final conditions. It was not in whether or not something had really been taken into account, because the environment minister had conditioned around the document that had not been included anyway. So this is not an issue like thatâ€”and I am not accusing the environment minister of making a decision like that. But under this change it becomes possible for an environment minister to ignore the impact on the Great Barrier Reef, to ignore the impact on a threatened species like the koala or to ignore the impact on an endangered wetland, let something through and have nobody who has legal standing to be able to challenge that even though it might be a concern to almost every other Australian around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How on earth can a parliament say, 'We support there being legislation with all these conditions, but we don't support whether or not the environment minister will have to abide by them'? That is the impact we are talking about. The reality of it which would then flow in terms of the proponents themselves will be the delay in finding out whether or not they have certainty on the project. It will just take longer because you will have a protracted debate about standing before you ever get to the merits of it. At every angle this is an attempt from the government to wreck certainty for industry and create a potential for environmental considerations of the most iconic type to be completely ignored by a future environment minister. The parliament is being asked to legislate to allow an environment minister to ignore its legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot begin to think of the gravity, of the stupidity of what is before this parliament now. The government has decided to manufacture, where there had been certainty and this could have been certainty quickly, a crisis and create a lack of confidence for investment in Australia. They then decided the answer was, from industry's perspective, to make the time for certainty as long as possible and then decided that a possible outcome would be that an environmental consideration, no matter how iconic, could in the future be wilfully ignored by a minister for the environment and there would be no legal recourse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation does deal with extremists. It deals with an extreme ideology which says environmental considerations in the future should be ignored. You would never have found this under the Howard government. You only find this led by a Prime Minister who knowingly wants to attack the environment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  I rise, of course, to oppose this ridiculous piece of legislation that seeks to amend the environment protection and biodiversity conservation legislation to take out section 487 of that act to remove standing in respect of third-party interventions on development affecting the environment. What a ridiculous piece of legislation. It really is just a fatuous piece of left-baiting that is going to do nothing for this country or this country's economy. At a time when last-quarter growth was 0.2 per cent, half of what was anticipated for the last quarter; at a time when disposable income per capita has been shrinking for the past five quarters in a row; at a time when there are 800,000 unemployed people in Australia for the first time in about 20 years; at a time when wages growth is the slowest it has been since the wages price index started being kept in the 1990s; at a time in which the government has between the 2014 federal budget and the 2015 federal budget doubled the deficit, it is actually ridiculous that they are spending their time on stupid left-baiting like this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a bill that is all about trying to throw up a bit of smoke and mirrors, a bit of misdirection, saying: 'Look over here, look over here! We're doing something, we're doing something!' to try to cover up the fact that the government actually has no agenda, has no plan for this nation. They might have a pamphlet, but they certainly do not have a plan. They are a government that is such an embarrassment. Every journalist on the second-year anniversary of this government this week wrote about the utter embarrassment that this government has been in that two-year period. You saw some scathing commentary from the journalists across the different news organisations and papers about what we have seen in the first two years of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen an eccentric Prime Minister with his crazy let's-knight-a-prince idea on Australia Day and his very interesting approach to this parliament where he comes in and carries on like a buffoon in question time, calling the Australian Labor Party racist because we are interested in how labour market testing and skills testing might work in a free trade agreement with one of our neighbours. This is the behaviour of someone who is just not fight to govern, someone who is not fit to be the Prime Minister of Australia. If you want to be an undergraduate stunt puller in a government then perhaps don't occupy the position of Prime Minister. I know I am not the only person who has these views. I also know I am not the only person who has these views based on those sorts of antics and that it is not only people on this side of the House who think the Prime Minister ought not be in that position. We saw earlier this year the spectacle of the nation's Prime Minister being challenged to a spill without there even being another candidate. That is how bad this Prime Minister has been and how embarrassed the entire nation is at having him.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You need look no further for evidence of that embarrassment than the recent national reform summit. Here is a Prime Minister whose behaviour, conduct and track record are so poor that across civil society, business and the fourth estate you have had people saying, 'Oh my god, we don't think that politics is working anymore.' Why is politics not working? Because the nation's erstwhile leader is more interested in carrying on, picking fights, brawling, left-baiting and throwing up these sorts of smoke and mirrors and misdirections than he is in thinking about the national interest. I am not surprised that some of the people who backed him in so strongly in 2013 against the Labor Prime Minister at the time are now a bit embarrassed about the person that they helped to install as Prime Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This piece of legislation that we are debating in the House today when we should be debating much more significant issues for the nation's future is utterly ridiculous, but it is also another piece of misdirection from this government. It is also a real indication of the contempt with which this government holds civil society and particularly people who are engaged in community organisations who are interested in the environment. Those are not people who are confined to one side of politics or to one particular political party. You will find people from the Left and the Right who are interested in ensuring that our environment is protected. In my own electorate I have wonderful community action groups that work to preserve biodiversity and to conserve nature, and they are not uniformly Labor people, I can tell you thatâ€”not by a long way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As if to demonstrate to the world the degree of contempt with which this government treats those organisations, we see this fatuous piece of legislation aimed at removing third-party intervention rights under the EPBC legislation. People in the community have reacted very strongly. I have certainly got a lot of representations being made to my office about the concerns that people hold in respect of this plan to remove an opportunity for judicial scrutiny of these projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Being for standing for third-party groups is not an indicator that you are against development or that you are against, for example, resources projects. I myself am strongly in favour of seeing more investment in resources projects, in seeing more opportunities for our resources sector to grow. I know that coal is our No. 1 export commodity and our No. 1 export product. I also appreciate the other resources work that is done in this country and I am, as I say, strongly for resources developmentâ€”provided that it is safe, provided that it is consistent with Australia's strict environmental standards, provided that there are good Australian jobs and opportunities that come out of those projects, and provided that those projects contribute to the overall national interest and are to the benefit of all people in our community, including through paying their fair share of taxation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Being someone who is for resources projects does not necessitate the conclusion that I would therefore be in favour of this ridiculous piece of legislation that seeks to remove people's rights to raise concerns through the courts in the event that the environmental protection and biodiversity conservation legislation is breached. This is being framed as a situation where you are either for resources, and therefore for this bill, or you are against this bill and therefore some sort of person who does not really care about resources development. It is just wrong and it is nonsensical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can see that this bill is really much more of a political campaign for the government than it is a real, measured and deliberate piece of law reform. There are a few clues to that proposition. One of those clues is that this is not a new provision; this is a provision that was introduced under the Howard coalition government and it has been an uncontroversial provision ever since it was passed 15 years ago. It is not the case that this is some sort of radical left-wing conspiracy to choke development and to choke national resources in this country, no matter what members opposite might claimâ€”and it is pretty funny when they do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another clue that this is really much more of a political campaign than a serious attempt at law reform is the language that is being used by the coalition, such as this nonsensical idea of 'lawfare'â€”what a ridiculous word! If you are going to use the language of 'lawfare', you might actually think about what sorts of parallels you are drawing. This comes in a week in which this parliament has been considering the assistance that should be given to people who are fleeing actual warfareâ€”the serious matter of the disintegration of Syria and the fighting that has been going on there, now in its fifth year. That is the seriousness with which the language of 'warfare' should be used. To adopt the language of 'lawfare' is as silly as it is insulting to those people who are facing genuine conflict.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another clue to the fact that this is a solution in search of a problem is the track record of the use of these standing provisions under the EPBC Act. Only about 0.4 per cent of EPBC Act referralsâ€”that is 0.4 per cent, not four per centâ€”have ever been challenged in court, so these suggestions of some sort of avalanche of litigation, of 'lawfare', are frankly ridiculous. We are talking here about judicial review rights. We are not talking here about full merits reviews of decisions for approvals under this legislation; we are talking about looking to see whether the decision has been lawfully made. The court does not put itself in the shoes of the person making the decision and say, 'That is all fine and well, but I would have made this other decision.' The court just looks to make sure that the decision has been made in accordance with the proper processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want an example of that, have a look at the Carmichael litigation that seems to have prompted the government to move this legislation. This was a case in which the government incompetently managed to get the decision making wrong. That is what happenedâ€”it was government incompetence. The decision-making process was not correctly followed and, as a consequence, the government agreed to the court orders that were made in the case. We are not talking about a situation where the government made a flawless decision and the court overturned it at all. We are talking about a situation where there was a mea culpa on the part of the government in respect of its own incompetence, and that is what led to the consent orders being madeâ€”and I stress the word 'consent'. That is a really good example, and it also goes to my point about the obviousness, the transparency, of the fact that this is really just about politics, not about the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The standing provisions under section 487, which is the provision to be repealed if this legislation passes, are already sufficiently rigorous. The standing provision limits legal challenges only to community groups that have been active on environmental issues for at least two years. Not just any person can wander up to the court and bring proceedings. We are also talking about Federal Court proceedings. These are expensive to launch. This is a matter that you only do if you have some serious basis and, if you do not, under the Federal Court rules the court is in a position to consider whether or not the proceeding ought to be continued where there is an abuse of process or if it is a trivial matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the substance of the issue, it is also, I think, relevant to remember that there is actually a public interest in having appropriate scrutiny of decisions made under the environmental protection and biodiversity conservation legislation. Let us remember that we are dealing here with possibly significant impacts on the environment and biodiversity. To think that it is somehow a good idea to lessen the scrutiny as part of this sort of silly political campaign, this smoke and mirrors, this misdirection that the government is deploying to take away scrutiny from its own incompetence and also to deflect attention away from the fact that it really has no agenda and no plan, is just irresponsible. And I say 'irresponsible' advisedly. For a party that supposedly stands for personal responsibility, in a situation where its own government has been incompetent, to look around for someone else to shift the blame to really exposes the hypocrisy of this government and the flimsy foundationâ€”I think probably 'flimsy' is too kind a descriptionâ€”or utter lack of a foundation for this ridiculous legislation that we are in here debating today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, if this legislation is passed, it is really going to put an end to any effective legal challenges against federal approvals of major industrial developments with high environmental impacts, and no-one would want that. I think, frankly, that it would be a higher priority for the resources sector to have a government that is actually competent and to get these things right than it would be to remove a provision in circumstances in which, as I say, only 0.4 per cent of EPBC Act referrals have ever been challenged in court. This sort of idea that there is some sort of avalanche of litigation out there, that there are gangs of people waiting to bring proceedings under section 487 of the legislation, seems to me to be a bit of an overstatement, to put it nicely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make the point that this bill has come about in an utter policy vacuum from this government. It is looking for things to do. It is wandering around saying, 'Oh my goodness, what can we do?' and everyone knows it. It is an embarrassment of a government. It is a government that should be dealing with the major economic challenges facing our nation. It is a government that ought to be dealing with improving the living standards of all Australians, improving our prosperity and improving the ability for everyone to share in that prosperity. This bill is a distraction, and it ought to be defeated.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Denison</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  Anything that diminishes the protection for the environment is obviously wrong and to be resisted. So too to deny some Australian citizens the right to access all aspects of the legal system, no matter what the matter is, or to deny some Australian citizens the right to judicial review in particular is self-evidently wrong. In fact, anything that diminishes the protection of the environment, anything that diminishes the rights of our citizens, is so self-evidently wrong that it is quite remarkable that it has come before the parliament and that we even need to debate the rights and wrongs of these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also wrong for us to look at these issues in isolation. I suggest we need to take a step back at this point and have a look at the direction our country is going in a whole range of ways and, in particular, the direction we are going for the rights of our citizens and the way in which the rights of our citizens and our groups, be they environmental groups or any other groups, are slowly being diminished in an incremental way. When you take a step back and you look at a whole range of decisions that have been made by this and previous governments, including the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Standing) Bill 2015, which is before the parliament today, which would deny some Australian citizens the right to access all aspects of the legal system, you can draw a conclusion that Australia has reached the stage of being almost in a police state. The rights of citizens have been diminished so far and the power of the state has increased so much that we are in what I will characterise as a 'pre police state'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I turned my mind to this issue today in preparing this speech, it took me very little time to quickly come up with some 10 characteristics of a pre police state which exist in Australia right now. I will quickly rattle through them, if you do not mind, Deputy Speaker. For a start, there is the way that all members of the community are now monitored by the state on account of mandatory metadata retention, which passed this parliament some time ago, is already in law and will be implemented from next month. The community need to understand that, from next month, every phone call they make, every website they visit and every location signal sent from their mobile phone or other mobile electronic device will be recorded by law and can be accessed by the security services without warrant. This is something that has been rejected by many other developed countries. The scale of the mandatory metadata retention which is being implemented in this country from next month is almost unprecedented around the world in any developed country or democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another characteristic of a pre police state is the way that the media is being manipulated in this country. We have seen the way that funding for independent broadcasters, the ABC and the SBS, has been reduced. We have seen the way government ministers have bullied the ABC, bullied the Fairfax papers and bullied some of the News Limited papers, at least the tabloids. We have seen the way that in this country <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> broadsheet has now become almost like <span style="font-style:italic;">Pravda</span> was in the Soviet Union, as the official organ of the Australian Liberal Party. Again, this is a characteristic of a pre police state: the way the media is being used and manipulated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another characteristic of a pre police state is the manipulation of the judiciary. It is remarkable that the government sees nothing wrong, nothing wrong at all, in the fact that a royal commissioner would agree to go to a party political event.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another characteristic of a pre police state is the secrecy that we see with this government and the ludicrous level of secrecy that surrounds our response to irregular immigration and the development of this term 'on-water operations', whatever that is. All we know is that it is some sort of term that means, 'We are not going to tell you what is going on, even if it is being paid for by you, even if it is being done in your name and even if it is of great humanitarian significance.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another characteristic of a pre police state is the fact that in law in this country now you can be arrested on suspicion, in the absence of any hard evidence, when it comes to terrorism. This, of course, is contained in one of the approximately seven separate pieces of legislation that have passed the Australian parliaments since 9/11. The fact is that in Australia you can be arrested, in the absence of hard evidence, just on suspicion of thinking that you are going to do something in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another characteristic of a pre police state, and something that we see in Australia, is the fact that some people can be incarcerated indefinitely without trial. That is exactly what we are doing to some asylum seekers. They are being incarcerated, seemingly indefinitely and definitely without trial, in third countries that we send them toâ€”we send them to Manus Island in Papua New Guinea or to the Republic of Nauru.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another characteristic of a pre police stateâ€”there is no shortage of things I can rattle off hereâ€”is the fact that this government now shows complete and utter disregard for international law and any number of international agreements that previous parliaments and previous governments have agreed to. For instance, this government ignores its own statute. This government ignores the refugee convention. This government ignores the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. A healthy democracyâ€”one that respects the rule of law, the rights of its citizens and the rights of the citizens of other countriesâ€”is one with a government that respects international law and international agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another characteristic of a pre police state is one in which the parliament, the elected representatives of the people, are forbidden to debate and decide on important matters of state. We had the situation yesterday where the government, in secret, decided to start bombing the sovereign state of Syria. The matter was never allowed to be debated by the parliament and was never voted on by the parliament. This makes Australia almost unique among our allies and among many developed countries. The fact is that in this country the parliament is not involvedâ€”it is not allowed to be involvedâ€”in decisions about waging war. In the United States the Congress has to debate and vote on declaring war. In France, Germany and the Netherlands, their parliaments are all required by law to debate and vote on the use of force. Even in the United Kingdom, where it is not law, it is certainly convention that the House of Commons these days will debate and decide on whether or not British military forces are committed to a conflictâ€”but not in Australia, not in our pre police state, where parliament is not allowed to even have a proper debate, let alone a vote, about these sorts of matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another characteristic of a pre police state that we see in this country these days is the way our safeguard mechanisms are disregarded, or even bullied, if they get in the government's way. We saw the terrible treatment of the President of the Human Rights Commission when she spoke up on the issue of asylum seekers. A good government, in a healthy democracy, would have listened to the President of the Human Rights Commission. It would have listened very carefully and it would have been very careful to take the advice of the President of the Human Rights Commission and be seen to take that advice. Instead, what we saw was a conga line of ministers all lining up to have a go at her and to bully her. That is how an autocratic regime acts. It is not how a democratically elected government should act. It is not how our government should act. It was a shame on this government, the way it treated the President of the Human Rights Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another characteristic of a pre police state is when security agencies start acting beyond their lawful powers. Although it was eventually halted, in the face of overwhelming public concern and protest, the Australian Border Force thought it was okay to conduct an operation on the streets of Melbourne, a couple of weeks ago now, where it would have acted unlawfully by stopping people on the street to check their papers, so to speakâ€”something that is not allowed in the act and is beyond their legal power. But was there any condemnation from this government over this? Was anyone sacked or held to account? No. All we heard from the relevant minister, in interview after interview, were attempts to try and downplay the matter and to say, 'It was not that big a deal; it was just a badly worded press release.' No, it was not a badly worded press release. It was worded exactly the way the Australian Border Force had intended for it to be worded. It was a press release that went to the minister's office beforehand; we are not sure exactly how many timesâ€”it seems to have been at least twice, perhaps three times or perhaps more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a long and pretty painful list to go through, but if I could come up with 10 characteristics of a pre police state and jot them down in a matter of minutes this morningâ€”and I am sure I could add to that with any number of other ways in which our democracy is diminished right nowâ€”what does that say about our country? It puts this bill in quite a different light. If we were a healthy democracy, without that list of 10 characteristics of a pre police stateâ€”if this bill just came in fresh and there was nothing else going on around usâ€”maybe we would respond to it differently. I do not think we would, actually, because it is self-evident we should not diminish the protections for the environment. It is self-evident that we should not deny some members of the community or some groups within the community the right to access all aspects of our legal system including judicial review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a serious matter in its own right, this bill that is before the parliament, but when you put in the context of all the other things that have gone on in recent years in this country, you start to understand that this country not only is going in the wrong direction but has gone a long way in the wrong direction. When you look back history at the lessons of history and you look at once great countries that deteriorated over time or their democracy deteriorated over timeâ€”and some ultimately became police statesâ€”you see that often it happened incrementally. Often it did not happen with one seismic event where a dictator came to power. Sometimes these autocratic regimes were democratically elected. Over time, bit by bit, the country's democracy deteriorated, was diminished bit by bit. And then one day the community woke up and asked: how on earth did we get here? How on earth did we allow ourselves to now be living in a country that is so bad, that is so far removed from the wonderful democracy it once was? How on earth did we allow a democratically elected government to bit by bit, incrementally, one bill at a time take us so far away from the healthy wonderful democracy we once had?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the problems is bit by bit things become normal. We get used one little bit then there is another little bit, another bill. I made the point already, since 9-11 there have been about 70 separate pieces of legislation in this country to do with our national security, even though it could be argued our laws at the time of 9-11 in 2001 were just about right. It was clearly a serious criminal offence to murder back then; it still is now. There is no doubt that much of that legislation contained in those 70 or so bills is unnecessary. We have gone too far in that regard. We must, however, ensure we keep our safeguards in place. That is one of the reasons why this bill is so badâ€”that we would think it okay to deny some Australians their lawful access to the courts.</span>

                    <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Charlton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Standing) Bill 2015. The Abbott government has an appalling record on the environment and this ill conceived bill clearly represents a further attack on the environment by a desperate Prime Minister and a government which is openly hostile to sensible environmental protections. This bill seeks to amend an act passed by the Howard coalition government that has created a scheme of environmental protections that have served Australia well over the last 15 years. Only a desperate Prime Minister who is leading a shambolic and chaotic government would seek to amend the system created by his political mentor and one that is working well. It is little wonder that the Abbott government has such a hostility to all things environmental as the Prime Minister is propped up by a weird gaggle of extreme climate change deniers who are an embarrassment to the few sensible Liberal politicians left on the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is right to oppose this bill and I am very pleased to provide this contribution explaining why this bill should not pass. This bill seeks to amend the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 by repealing section 487. Section 487 extends the meaning of a person aggrieved in the administrative decisions Judicial Review Act 1977. With these amendments, the government is seeking to remove the ability of third parties to take action under the EPBC Act that will only permit persons who meet the standing test in the ADGR act to apply for judicial review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before discussing why the bill should be opposed, it is important to examine the way in which the EPBC Act has been operating over the last 15 years. As I said previously, the act is working well and is serving its intended purpose. The act was introduced by Prime Minister John Howard in 2000 and has operated these past 15 years throughout the height of Australia's mining boom. Throughout the boom, there have been no issues with section 487.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us consider that since the act commenced operation in July 2000, around 5,500 projects have been through the EPBC process. Of these projects, there have only been three Federal Court challenges by third parties against 22 projects. Out of these 33, six were legally successful in the sense that the applicant received a judgement in their favour and only one project has been stopped. This figure is important: one project out of 5,500 over 15 years. That one fact completely demonstrates the hollowness of this bill that we are discussing nowâ€”one project out of 5,500 but suddenly we have got a massive problem that needs to be urgently addressed. This government is trying to justify this amendment by creating the impression of a crisis in project approvals. The figures I have mentioned clearly demonstrate that there is no crisis and the government is blatantly misleading the Australian people in pretending there is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The EPBC Act is operating well and this bill must be opposed. The plain intention of this bill is to continue the attacks on the environment by the Abbott government. They claim the current system is costing jobs. We all know that the only jobs the Prime Minister and his colleagues are worried about are their own. Their claims about jobs regarding the EPBC Act is an unconscionable misrepresentation. As I said, the act has been operating for the last 15 years through the mining boom. It has been the key environmental protection law throughout this period and it has posed no problem to the economy. The changes the government are attempting to make are political fix for their own incompetence regarding the approval process for the Adani mine and this legislation is trying to cover up that incompetence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, Labor has a proud record of environmental protection and we are always prepared to support sensible reforms in the national interest which would improve the environmental regulatory system, including the streamlining of assessment processes. What Labor will not support is this radical right-wing government's attempt to weaken fundamentally important environmental protections and limit the public's ability to seek judicial review of government's decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has presented this bill as limiting the ability of extreme environmentalist groups to exercise rights under this act. Well, it is not solely environmental groups that are being targeted by this amendment; it is farmers. For example, the discussion around the Shenhua mine on the Liverpool Plains would be endangered by this amendment. Any farmer seeking to express concern about development of mines in either their local community or communities upstream from them would be constrained by the operation of this amendment. Communities themselves, without any deep environmental conviction, will be retarded from taking action if this bill is successful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to point out that, under the current system, there is no ability to challenge the merits of a project approval under the EPBC Act. Only the legal validity of a project can be challenged. This already represents a significant limitation as a feature of the current system. I do not propose to spend too much time talking about the Adani Carmichael mine, which is supposedly the trigger for this action, other than to make a very basic point. The government is in this position with the EPBC Act's movement around Adani as a direct result of its own failure to comply with its own law. The Federal Court even identified this in a statement it issued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">3. Under the terms of s 139(2) of the Act, it was mandatory for the Minister to have regard to the approved conservation advices. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Talk about a pathetic excuse for a so-called Minister for the Environmentâ€”who, as we all know, wrote his thesis arguing that a market based mechanism was the most cost-efficient way to combat carbon pollution and then abolished the very market mechanism he advocated for. For the government to mask his incompetence by trying to push this bill through parliament demonstrates the callow nature of that individual and this government. The government are in this difficult situation of their own making and are trying to hide behind shameful rhetoric about so-called lawfare and jobs. They are blatantly trying to hide their own mistakes. Their minister, the so-called Minister for the Environment, stuffed it up. He stuffed it up; his office stuffed it up; his department stuffed it up. That was what the Federal Court confirmed. It was not environmental vandals; it was not radical green groups; it was Minister Hunt stuffing up the application of an act he has responsibility for administering.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would now like to draw the attention of the House to some of the disgraceful contributions by members opposite on this issue. It is well known that the member for Dawson is a climate change denier. He has absolutely zero credibility on environmental issues. But, according to his blog, the government's course of action regarding this issue is a result of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General heeding his advice. God help us if the legislative agenda of this government is being determined by advice from the member for Dawson. His blog is, to be honest, a very entertaining read. It bears little relationship to reality, but it is entertaining. In his 17 August contribution, he writes that he has spoken to the Attorney-General and:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I told him that it was unacceptable that groups that had nothing to do with this project were able to hold up and try to kill off jobs by waging warfare through the legal system. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Dawson clearly has no understanding of the EPBC Act. As I outlined previously, there is no ability to challenge the merits of projects approved under the EPBC Act. Only the legal validity of a project can be challenged. In the case of Adani Carmichael, the minister failed to apply his own laws. The member for Dawson continually slanders citizens who have a regard for protection of our natural environment. I rarely agree with Alan Jones, but he is right when he says: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is extreme and offensive is the member for Dawson's and this government's continual denial of good environmental protection, of climate change science and of good, sound policy advice on how to care for our environment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that good governments know that there is no need to choose between coal and the protection of the environment. I am proud to represent a coalmining region. I am proud that there are four operational coalmines in my electorate. I am proud that Charlton houses the biggest power station in this country, proudly fired by black coal. I am proud that coal has built the Newcastle and Hunter Valley region. It is a legacy I honour. It is a legacy that can continue. But part of the continuing operation of these coalmines and project approval for new coalmines is a social contract, and that social contract has to be founded on a few key principles. The first is commitment to local jobs in the mines and in the supply chain. Too often during the last mining boom, we saw the supply chain for mines being outsourced to overseas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second principle is a commitment to reducing the environmental footprint of the coalmines. I recently visited the Centennial Mandalong coalmine, which is one of the biggest underground coalmines in Australia, and they were briefing me on the very extensive work they do to minimise subsidence in the area. Subsidence is a very big issue in Newcastle and the Hunter Valley region, and they have been developing techniques to reduce that impact, reduce the local footprint of the coalmine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third principle has to be community involvement, supporting local communities, whether it is through sponsorship of the local football team or something else. For example, in my area Centennial Coal is a proud supporter of the Macquarie Scorpions, a rugby league club I am patron ofâ€”and I wish to say good luck to them in the upcoming finals series. They lost last week in the first round, but hopefully they can pull a victory out on Saturday. But that level of community involvement from coalmines and their workers is essential to fulfilling the social contract which mining must be based on in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth principle is a commitment from coalmining companies to engage on climate change, to invest in R&amp;D, to invest in technologies that mean that we can continue mining coal into the future. There are some interesting techniques being developed around carbon capture and storage. Some of them will work; some of them will not work; but it requires the coalmining companies to put their hands in their own pockets to invest in the R&amp;D. As we face a carbon constrained future, there will not be an industry that survives without capping its carbon emissions, whether that is at the actual coalmineâ€”for example, Mandalong colliery are spending lots of money developing ventilation and methane abatement technologies so that they reduce the level of methane escaping from the coalmineâ€”or it is investing in carbon capture and storage, or carbon capture and re-use, two technological areas that have been explored at the University of Newcastle's National Institute for Energy and Resources. If we are to continue to export coal, these fundamental technologies must be developed and commercialised. The Japanese are spending a lot of money on CCS. They are still recovering from the horrible Fukushima nuclear disaster and they realise that they need to diversify their energy mix. If they are going to have coal in the future, it must be with minimal carbon emissions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a part of the social compact that resource projects must have with Australia. That social compact has to be based on jobs, it has to be based on supporting local supply chains, it has to be based on supporting local communities through sponsoring sporting clubs and community organisations and it has to be based on sound environmental protections. This bill undermines that. It undermines that social compact by saying that groups like farmers, broader community groups and even, heaven forbid, environmental groups have no stake in the development of our resources industry and have no say in whether environmental protection and biodiversity must be respected. That is a hollow and false debate from a government that does not seek to lead this country; it seeks to divide this country. It seeks to pitch sections of the population against each other and surf on that divisiveness into power and to maintain power. That is an incredibly unfortunate frame of mine. It reflects some of the worst aspects of the Fraser years and, unfortunately, it is something that continues to this day. We can do better. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am confident that the resources industry in this country, in particular coalmining, can coexist with other industries, can coexist with growing and prosperous communities and can coexist with society that has greater environmental protections. But if we are to do that, we must reject this bill. This bill is a hollow attack on environmental protection. It is an attack motivated by the most base of circumstances to distract the Australian people from this government's appalling record of managing this country, particularly on economic management. We have unemployment figures coming outâ€”or they may have already come outâ€”and we have already seen this government making excuses for any upward revision of the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate, as it stands, is at a 13-year high and they are using bills like this to distract people from the real drivers of that unemployment. The real driver of that unemployment is the economic mismanagement of the coalition government. I proudly stand opposed to this bill. I proudly stand-up for coalmining communities but on the basis of a social compact with the community in which they operate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  In speaking on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Standing) Bill 2015, can I begin by commending the member for Charlton for his contribution to this debate, and I certainly endorse all that he has said in the speech he just made. In leading Labor's response to this legislation, the member for Grayndler outlined the track record of the Abbott government in turning its back on the environment. The member for Grayndler listed the numerous changes that the Abbott government has made since coming to office that weaken or abolish Australia's environmental protection laws. No Australian government on record has turned its back on the environment and sought to demonise environmentalists more so than has done the Abbott government. No Australian government has either through ignorance or by deliberate intent ignored the value of the environment to our wellbeing, to our future and to the future of future generations to the extent that the Abbott government has.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If anyone wants an example of cost-shifting on to future generations, it is the Abbott government's denial of environmental responsibilities, ignoring the environmental consequences of its actions today and effectively transferring those consequences and the associated cost burdens on to future generations. The fact that broadcaster Alan Jones is running a campaign against this legislationâ€”Alan Jones not being a radical, left wing environmentalistâ€”should highlight for members opposite the absurdity of this legislation and their shallow justification for it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill removes the right of third parties to challenge the legality of a development which has environmental consequences by removing section 487 of the EPBC Act 1999. It is a provision that was introduced by the Howard government about 15 years ago. Since its introduction, there have been 5,500 development applications under this provision of the act. Of those 5,500 development applications, there have been 33 court challenges against 22 projects. Of those, six were successful and only one project has ever been stopped. The facts and the figures speak for themselves. There is no problem with the act or that section of it. The EPBC Act is serving Australia well and so is that particular section. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is indeed no basis and no justification on the facts presented for repealing section 487 of the EPBC Act. I have a copy of the act here with me and it includesâ€”and it is written very clearlyâ€”the condition that individuals or community groups must have been in that space for at least two years. That was a thought out piece of the act. It was not something that was just flippantly or carelessly included at the time, and it has served Australia well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Communities do not have the right to challenge the merits of a project approval. And under the act they do not have the right to challenge the merits of the project approval itself, but they have the right to challenge the legal validity of it. The situation is very different to the simplistic comparisons made by many members opposite when they liken third-party appeals for environmental matters to third-party appeals objecting to a residential development somewhere. The natural environment belongs to all Australians. Its destruction or degradation affects all Australians, nor can the natural environment speak for itself, in the same way that future generations have no voice about the decisions made by today's society. The environment is not a self-contained, isolated area but is connected to and forms part of the world around it and the global environment. As history shows, it is because of environmental activists that so many of Australia's iconic environmental assets have been preserved for future generations. The real issue, however, should never be about who it is that raises the objection. The real issue is: does the objection have merit? If it has, it should not be a question of who it was raised by. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's environment, like that across the world, is constantly under threat. We have seen, only in the last couple of hundred years of white settlement in this country, the loss of hundreds of species, and a further 1,700 species and ecological communities are currently under threat and at risk of extinction. In fact, Australia probably has the worst track record of any of the advanced countries with respect to the documented decline in biodiversity of any continent. More than 50 species of Australian animals and 48 species of Australian plants have been made extinct in the last couple of hundred years, and the situation for many others is just as serious. It is easy to ignore or to dismiss those statistics, because most people, including me, have probably never seen or heard of some of the species lost or at risk of being lost. Every time a species is lost there are consequences for others species. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact remains that it is environmentalists, who do not necessarily live next to development sites, who take the time to study the environment, who understand the environment best and who understand its value. If you are a research scientist based in one of the capital cities, it does not mean that you have no connection with the environment in the middle of Australia, where perhaps you have spent half your life doing the research work that you do. When you are aware that there is a risk to that environment, why should you not have the right, having put so much time and effort into preserving that environment, to also stand up for it? Of course you should. That is why section 487 is in the current EPBC Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The courts already have the ability to deal with vexatious claims simply by dealing with them expeditiously and, if necessary, by not only dismissing them but also awarding costs against the plaintiff. So, if there is a frivolous objection, then I believe that every court has the opportunity and the mechanism to deal with it. I also note that the recent decision by the government to set aside its own decision regarding the Adani project approval, because the government failed to comply with its own legal obligations, is being used as an example by coalition members of how actions of environmentalists obstruct projects from proceeding. That the Federal Court felt compelled to issue a public statement clarifying the Adani matter is telling of the distorted reporting of the facts and the politicisation of this matter by some media writers and some coalition members. The Federal Court statement makes the situation clear. As the member for Grayndler has already read the statement fully into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>I will limit my own comments about it. It is most unusual that a court of the land, the Federal Court, saw it necessary, effectively, to intervene in the public debate and issue a public statement in order to stop the misrepresentation of the matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also interesting that the matter goes to the heart of the minister's own department not providing him with the relevant information at the time. That in my mind raises a very serious question: why did the department fail to provide the minister with the information that was required? Was it because the department is under-resourced? If that is the case, again, it is consistent with the theme of this government in undermining the environment by not properly resourcing the very departments that act to protect it. The minister can respond to that when the debate is closed, but I suspect that the under-resourcing of the environment department is one of the reasons this mistake occurred. I suspect that it is also causing problems in the protection of the environment in so many other parts of the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The attacks on environmentalists by most of the coalition members who have spoken in support of this legislation are also extraordinary. These are the same people who come into this chamber and who, when it suits them, talk up the environmental wonders of Australia such as the Great Barrier Reef, the Daintree Rainforest region, Kakadu National Park, Fraser Island and probably all of Tasmania, because all of these places truly are environmental assets for Australia. They criticise the environmentalists who brought attention to the importance of these assets, but they never acknowledge that it was those same environmentalists who have today preserved them and that, through the preservation of those environmental assets, there is an economic value generated for the whole of the country. Through tourism alone, most of those places raise an extraordinary amount of income for the regions they are in. I have no doubt they form some of the most important reasons for people coming to Australia in the first place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If members opposite want to talk about jobs, then they should also be honest about the number of jobs that are created when we preserve our natural environment. The Great Barrier Reef is a good example where, supposedly, 60,000 jobs or thereabouts have been created in that part of Australia alone. I am sure that we could multiply that many, many times over when we combine all of the environmental assets that we have in this country. If we lost those environmental assets, there no longer would be a drawcard for many overseas visitors to come to Australia. In turn, what would be the downward effect to our economy of those losses? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The environment is a unique asset across the world, and particularly here in Australia, and we should do all that we can to preserve it. That is why the EPBC Act was legislated in the first place. It is because the parliament of the day, and preceding parliaments, recognised the importance and the value of it to our economy and to our nation and set about a process to make sure that it is protected for the future. Yet this government today wants to turn back what was implemented by previous governments who had the foresight to understand the importance of what they were doingâ€”previous governments which, I might say, included previous coalition governments, because it was indeed under the Howard government that the EPBC Act, including this particular section of the act, was legislated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I finish on this point: it was not that long agoâ€”it was, I think, in around 2009â€”that the Hawke report, which thoroughly reviewed the EPBC Act, was brought down. That review came up with an extraordinary number of recommendations, and there were suggestions made as to how the EPBC Act could be improved. None of those suggestions in any way raised concerns about section 487. So here we have an expert asked to look at the act and advise the parliament as to how we can make it better, and not once did he raise concerns about section 487. I would have thought that, if there was a legitimate concern about the operation of that section of the act, Mr Hawke would have found that concern and brought it to the attention of the parliament. But that was not done, because it was never a concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an ideological attack on the environmental movement across Australia by a government, the Abbott government, that simply does not understand or value the environment that we have in this country, and it is an ideological attack that goes to the heart of the work of thousands of people across this country who every day contribute towards preserving their local environment. I have to note again the hypocrisy I see from so many members opposite, who are prepared to stand up in this chamber and applaud the work of these environmentalists but, at the same time, try to diminish the very act that goes hand in glove with the work that they are doing to preserve what we have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I finish on this point: it is also concerning to hear criticism of environmental organisations because they have DGR status. The bottom line to DGR status is that people want to make contributions to the environmental movements they do because they value our environment. It is a choice people make. So to say that taxpayers' funds are being used to undermine development projects across this country is also an absurdity, because those people making those donations do not do it because of their tax-deductibility; they do it because they care about Australia's environment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Standing) Bill 2015, which is before us today, speaks volumes as to who this government is and the desperation that it now has. It is desperate to create an enemy and a villain within our community. This amendment that is before us is the government waging another ideological war over what should be sound environmental law that gives communities hope and confidence that this parliament and our laws will take on board their concerns about any major development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of the cabinet and this government have been very quick to stand in this place or in the public space, deem these groups to be vigilantes and label them as environmental radicals, wanting to smash up and destroy development. This government is wrong and could not be further from the truth. People who are actively involved in many of these cases include a number of people in regional areas: farmers, community groups, Landcare groups and people from my own electorate who are concerned about the impact that major mining developments or other developments are having on their local community and their local environment. It is wrong of the government to label anybody who exercises their rights under this act as vigilantes, environmental vandals or reckless. It is creating nothing but anxiety, fear and demonstrations of a government that is out of control, irrational and going for cheap headlines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The intention of the changes to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is to stop third parties from intervening on developments affecting their environment. It is unbelievable that the government would do this knowing full well about the concerns that have been raised within their own communities about a number of these projects. The National and Country Liberal MPs that will vote for this bill or stand and speak on this bill are letting down their communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The EPBC Act has been an overriding national environmental protection law for the past 15 years. It has stood and lasted through the mining boom, and it has posed no problem to creating jobs in that industry or the economy. Thousands of projects have been approved and managed effectively under our current system, which was here during the Howard government and then two terms of the Labor government. The intention to repeal section 487 of the EPBC Act is a rash reaction from the government, which is trying to cover up its own failuresâ€”which have been borne out in the courtsâ€”and at the same time trying to create another enemy within the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has been caught out for not properly managing the approval process of the Adani mine under the act, which is what has brought this legislation before us today. It is making outrageous claims and trying to change the legislation to cover up its own incompetency. The government's claims that this act is costing jobs are just outrageous and are another attempt by this government to pretend that it is a government focused on creating jobs when its actions, not just on this issue but on a number of issues, have put thousands of jobs within our country regional areas at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The EPBC Act was designed to protect the environment and gives local communities an opportunity to challenge any development that they believe may impact on their local community. Landholders have the right to appeal decisions where they believe projects may impact on their land. We are not talking about inner-city greenies as the government would have us pretend. We are talking about environmental groups in communities. We are talking about farmers. We are talking about groups like Lock the Gate. Lock the Gate has been vocal in a number of our communities. The Lock the Gate Alliance is a national grassroots organisation of over 40,000 supporters and more than 250 local groups. They are not the radicals the government would like to paint them as. They are, as I have said, our farmers. They are people in our schools in our regional communities. Sure, they have triangles, but they are yellow triangles not green triangles. They speak up because they believe the impact of overmining our land could put at risk good prime agricultural land. What they ask for is a set of laws that allow them to object to mining projects that could impact on their ability to keep their land productive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just the Lock the Gate Alliance who speaks up about these projects. The National Farmers' Federation recently spoke out against this government's decision to approve another coalmine. The National Farmers' Federation argues that farmers and food production need to come before the needs of the mining industry. These are not, as the government would like to present, radicals and vigilantesâ€”the nasty words they use for people who are speaking up about their concerns. These are people living in regional Australia. Whether they be involved in the National Farmers' Federation, the Lock the Gate Alliance, Landcare groups or other organisations, they are speaking up and wanting balance and fairness when it comes to decisions about the use of the land in their area.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People in my own electorate have been quite vocal about this, and a number of them have written to me. Kerry, from Woodend, said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I feel strongly about protecting our environment. I live in the Macedon Ranges and love its nature and wildlife. I'm in favour of clean energy sources rather than polluting ones. Can you please speak up for the above by refusing to weaken Australia's Protection Laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Barbara, from Macedon, said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Big polluters should not be able to develop projects without checks and balances. Australian communities and environment groups should have the right to access the law to speak up for land, water and wildlife and against polluting and damaging mining projects. Australia needs stronger, not weaker, nature protection laws to balance the power of big polluters over governmentsâ€”</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is up to government to make sure there are fair, balanced laws. Marie, from Bendigo, said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have been members of ACF for many years and are shocked at the strategies of this government to try and sabotage what would otherwise be sound law.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am shocked, angered and totally dismayed to read this morning's Age Newspaper regarding the Prime Minister's new attack on laws governing environmental protection and conservation groups.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just a few of the people who have raised concerns about not only this government's attacks on environmental law but also its outright hysteria in labelling as vigilantes those who speak up against proposals in their area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think about some of the other controversial projects in my part of the world. Near Maldon there is a proposal to have intensive chicken farming. A number of locals in Maldon and the Tarrengower community have objected to that project. They are worried about the effect it will have on their own enterprises. There is a stud farm there, there is a natural environment there and there is a school not far from where the proposal is. They have gone through several processes to challenge and tease out what is appropriate and fair development within their community. In our society, across regional Australia, there is always going to be conflict between different industries. It is the role of government to make sure there is a framework that is rigid, robust and fair enough to allow each of those groups to challenge possible development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our farmers are strongly making the point that we cannot afford to lose all of our prime agricultural and food production land to mining projects. We need to make sure that we have sound environmental and resource management of our land. For the government to try to turn its incompetent stuff-up in the courts into an opportunity to weaken the environment laws not only smacks of ridiculousness but is also a demonstration that it does not have the interests of regional Australia at heart. Instead, this is cheap political opportunism. This government is very quickly raging out of control. Whether it be this or other reforms, they have little care or regard for what is going on in regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the government claims that this project will create thousands upon thousands of jobs. The figures they bandy vary from question time to question timeâ€”one day it is 2,000, the next day it is 10,000 and then it is 5,000. But the mine says it will only create just over 1,000 jobs. They also will not confirm who those jobs will go to or whether they will be local workers. I suspect it will be FIFO workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government are serious about projects that create jobs, they need to work with industry to ensure that locals get those jobs first. Australians do not care if you are creating jobs for overseas workers. In fact they get frustrated. What we see time and time again from this government is that they say they are the champion of jobs but they are not championing Australians for jobs or locals first for local jobs. They are very happy and quite complicit with companies being able to bring in their own overseas workers to work the jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was recently in the north speaking to some workers in Townsville and Brisbane. They said to me that, when it comes to these projects, they do want to see more jobs in their regions but they want to see rules in place to ensure that the local kids and local people get opportunities at the jobs first. The government need to drop the rhetoric on this one and stick to sound environmental law that was introduced by one of their former governments. They need to stop going straight for the cheap political headline, using words that divide the community, labelling people as vigilante or radical green groups, and start being serious in engaging communities about what is appropriate, fair, environmental friendly or sound projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other speakers on this side of the House agree or disagree about whether the mining project itself is appropriate. I tend to be on the environmental side and on the side of the farmers. I want to see more and more of our land preserved for food production and agriculture. I have to ask all those National and Liberal MPs: where are you in this debate? Are you seriously standing up here and saying, 'Ignore the farmers' concerns, ignore the lock-the-gate concerns. Let's label them as radicals, environmentalists and greenies. Let's pretend they don't exist and let's just back our mates in big business. Let's try to cover up the fact that we stuffed up. Let's not be embarrassed when we go along to that next big fundraiser and say that we have the court case won on that one. Let's try to ram through an amendment to an act that has existed for a while that gave community assurances that decisions being made in their area, in regional Australia, was sound and that they had an opportunity to object.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our communities need to know that their views are being listened to. Currently the act that we have before us gives communities the confidence in our planning system. They guard against corruption and result in better environmental assessments and outcomes. I urge the House to vote down this amendment that will only create more fury and more wars in our community. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It is yet another attack in this government's relentless war on the environment and groups that take it upon themselves to protect it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately for the people of Australia this government, the Abbott government, does not believe in accountability. It does not like its legislation to be challenged. It does not like any of its legislation to be questioned. It is all about closing off any sort of scrutiny. This legislation goes along those lines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has a provision that will no longer allow the public to challenge the legality of decisions made by the government, a government that cannot stand scrutiny. It runs against the rule of law, democratic accountability and history. It should be seen for what it isâ€”another attempt to stop environmental concerns from getting in the way of economic priorities. It is a reactionary response to the successful challenge by the Mackay Conservation Group on the decision to approve the Carmichael coal mine. It builds on the government's draconian funding cuts already made to public-interest environmental legislation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The one thing that the people of Australia know is that you cannot trust this government when it comes to the environment. We have had the environment minister standing up day after day in this parliament spruiking anti-environmental policies. It is a government that has absolutely no respect for the environment and a government that does not understand the importance of our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been overwhelmed with emails and comments from my constituents about the proposal to change this act. Just for the members on the other side of this House, this does not have the support of the community. This is just another blatant ploy to play politics. The intention to repeal section 407 of the EPBC Act is a rash reaction to the government's incompetence and failure. That was borne out in the courts. The Australian government was embarrassed last month when a small environmental group was successful. Let's get this rightâ€”that was because the minister had failed to present documents showing how they would ensure protection of two vulnerable species, the yakka skink and the ornamental snake. This is just another example of a government not wanting to be held accountable for its incompetence. This government really should be condemned for the action in this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government claims that the EPBC Act is costing jobs, and that is absolutely outrageous. The only thing that is costing this country jobs is the government's incompetence and the Prime Minister's determination to fight for his own job and for no-one else's. We have seen the car industry disappear from Australia. We have seen the government failing to ensure that Australian workers can get work in the shipping industry. Under Tony Abbott, more than 800,000 people are now unemployedâ€”the first time it has been this high in 20 years.</span>

She should be making sure that there are jobs available for her constituents rather than sitting there and seeing the jobs go out the doorâ€”not good enough, Member for Corangamite; I am very disappointed that you are not standing up for your community. Labor will not under any circumstance support weakening environmental protection or limiting a community's right to challenge government decisions. This is a government that is not about jobs. We in the opposition are about jobs.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since being passed by the Howard government 15 years ago, the EPBC Act has been the overriding national environmental protection law, including throughout the whole of the mining boom. Environmental groups are required to operate within this law. It has been on the books for 15 years and it is only now, after the environment minister has been incompetent, that the government are seeking to change it. I can understand that. They probably realise that his incompetence will continue. This legislation was designed to protect the environment because the environment is important. Threatened species are important. Unfortunately, the government do not appreciate the importance of the environment not only for those people in the areas that will be affected by development but for Australia and the whole of the world's ecosystems. Under this proposed legislation, landholders have a right to appeal decisions where a project impacts on their land, but, where the legislation was intended to protect the environment for, say, a threatened species, under this bill those groups and organisations standing up for the environment will not have the ability to challenge decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Community objection rights are important because they build community confidence in the planning system, they guard against corruption and they result in better environmental assessments and outcomes. The threat of third-party appeals creates a stronger incentive for proponents and the government to adhere to the law, improving the quality of environmental assessment of major projects. It is not the actual exercise of power to enforce the public right that matters most but the threat that it will be exercised that wins improved accountability to an approval system that can be plagued by vested interestsâ€”something that those on the other side of this House do not like to hear. They do not like accountability; they do not like transparency; they do not like openness. We have seen that time and time again in this House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In looking at this provision, only about 0.4 per cent of the EPBC Act referrals have ever been challenged. The scope of the appeal rights within the EPBC Act 1999 is already restricted to judicial review. Communities do not have the right to challenge the merit of a project, yet this government wants to see the law amended even further so that the protection of the environment is thrown out the door. It is very disturbing and really shows that you cannot trust the Abbott government. It objects to being held accountable and, as I said, does not like scrutiny. Removing effective appeal rights will result in less scrutiny and rigour in the assessment process and will most likely result in poorer environmental outcomes at a time when Australia's natural environment is under greater threat than ever. That the government constantly denies that climate change existsâ€”we have a Prime Minister who calls it 'crap'â€”is testimony to the fact that this government does not take environmental protection seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this amendment is made to the EPBC Act, the only people who will be able to challenge the approval of a mine or any other major industrial development with high environmental impacts will be individuals who can prove they will be directly affected, who have the funds to go to court and who have the courage to risk a massive cost order against them which will probably bankrupt them if they lose. In short, it will effectively put an end to any legal challenges against federal approvals of major industrial developments with high environmental impacts. No wonder this government is called the anti-environment government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting to look at the people who have questioned whether this amendment should be enacted. Even Phillip Ruddock has questioned the government's plan to prevent environmental groups from challenging major mining projects. Alan Jones, who is a strong supporter of those on the other side, has also questioned this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will conclude by saying: this government does not like being held accountable. It does not like openness and transparency. It has no respect for the environment. This legislation should not pass the House; it should not pass the Senate; it should not become law because it is one of the greatest threats to our environment that this country has seenâ€”second to one: the Abbott government.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  I am opposed to this bill. It does not take an environmental scientist to realise that Australia's natural environment is the envy of the world. We are blessed with some of the most spectacular surrounds that attract people from every nation to our shores. But there is more to places like the Great Barrier Reef and Uluru than just their good looks. Our environment is large and complex. It nurtures us, supports us and gives us a place to live, work and play; it informs our national identity and it possesses an intrinsic economic value and a greater economic value than most Australians would appreciate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, a group of international researchers from the Australian National University and the University of South Australia estimated the work of Australia's ecosystem services to be around $5 trillion per year; but it is declining in Australia, as it is over the rest of the world. The researchers found that the global area of tropical forest has declined by 642 million hectares between 1997 and 2011, while deserts had grown by 234 million hectares. Coral reefs had gradually been turned into sea grass and algae beds. The area of ocean coral has shrunk by 34 million hectares, while sea grass and algae beds had grown by the same amount between 1997 and 2011. The global area of wetlands has shrunk by more than 14 million hectares.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, this is where the Abbott government fits into this picture. This bill represents the latest wave of this Abbott government's attack on our environment and the people who seek to protect and represent that environment. This government has proven time and time again that not only is the environment not on their list of priorities but it is not even in their list of vocabulary. In the first year of the Abbott government, they destroyed Australia's efforts to lead the global push towards a cleaner energy future. They abolished the Climate Commission and they attempted to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Renewable Energy Agency. They have reviewed our marine national reserves and they have abolished the price of carbon in our economy. That is just in the first year of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effects of this bill are to further their anti-environmental agenda by changing the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to stop third-party interventions on developments affecting the environment. This change is unconscionable and patently unnecessary. Since the EPBC Act commenced in July 2000, approximately 5,500 projects have been through the system. That is 5,500 approvals that have been granted under this act. Of these, there have been only 33 Federal Court challenges by third parties against only 22 projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of statistics and percentages, this represents a mere 0.4 per cent of projects referred under the EPBC Act. Of the 33 actions, four were discounted or resolved with the consent of the parties; six were legally successful in the sense that the applicant received a judgement and/or orders in its favour; and only one project was actually stopped. All others were legally unsuccessful. The EPBC Act has been the overriding national environmental protection law for last 50 years. It is our national environmental asset protection legislation. It has done this job, including through the mining boom, and has posed no problems for our economy. The approval of thousands of projects was managed perfectly well under this system by the Howard government and two terms of the Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That begs the question: why on earth is the Abbott government doing this? Why on earth are they making it more difficult and removing the right of communities and third parties to challenge environmental decisions? I think you only need to look at the timing of this particular decision, because this policy and this change was announced in a week where it was leaked from cabinet that there was nothing on the cabinet agendaâ€”not a single thing to be debated on the cabinet agenda. That highlights the fact that this government does not have a plan. They do not have a plan to manage and govern our nation and our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So in a week where there is nothing on the agenda, why not go out and attack environmental organisations? Why not go out and try to undermine the integrity of a bill that protects our environment and, by all accounts and by all statistics, has been working well in serving our economy and our environment and getting that balance right many, many years? The intention to repeal section 487 of the EPBC Act is a dramatic and dangerous overreaction by a Prime Minister who is desperate to save his job. It has been brought on by the government's complete stuff up in respect of the approval of the Adani coalmine in Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes that the rights of communities and third parties to oppose onerous developments is vital as it helps to maintain confidence in the system, prevents questionable findings and leads to all around better environmental outcomes. Basically, this provision in the EPBC Act is fundamental to our democracy. It is the opportunity for communities to challenge bad environmental decisions and this government wants to remove that right. It is important to note that standing provisions under section 487 of the current EPBC Act are already sufficiently rigorous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As it currently stands, communities do not have the right to challenge the merits of a project approval under the EPBC Act, only the legal validity of it. This is a very, very important distinction, which I think has been lost on the environment minister and the government. It limits legal challenges only to community groups who have been active on environmental issues for at least two years. If section 487(2) is repealed, then the onus falls back entirely onto individuals to prove that they are directly affected in order to challenge any mining approvals. This, of course, is an effective way to silence dissent, as individuals rarely possess the necessary resources to challenge multibillion-dollar mining conglomerates in court. The risk is simply too great for any individual to entertain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The matter that triggered this referral and this change of the law was, of course, the Adani coalmine decision in Queensland. That challenge was made by the Environmental Defenders Office on behalf of the communities surrounding the mine. This government wants to undermine that process and that right. The result of this change would, of course, be the end of any challenges by those communities to large-scale projects that have a significant impact on the environment. One of the shameful hallmarks of this government has been its propensity to distance the Australian people from the decisions and actions that affect our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will always support common-sense improvements to our environmental regulatory system such as the streamlining of assessment approvals and processes. But we will not support the weakening of environmental protections or the limiting of a community's right to challenge government decisions. That is exactly what this bill does. It undermines a fundamental premise of our democracyâ€”that people have the right to challenge decisions relating to the environment in which they live when there is a good chance that those decisions will have a detrimental effect on their quality of life and the communities they inhabit. That is exactly what this reform will do. It will undermine the right and ability of those communities to challenge those decisions. On that basis, it must be voted down by the House of Representatives.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:31</span>):  I rise to oppose the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Standing) Bill 2015. The bill was introduced into the parliament on 20 August. It is a very simple piece of legislation. Its only measure, the only change it will effect to our law, is the simple repeal of one provisionâ€”section 487 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. That provision provides extended standing to challenge decisions made under the EPBC Act. Its repeal will have the effect that the usual rules of standing under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act apply to the review of decisions under the EPBC Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This may be a simple piece of legislation, but it tells you a lot about this government. The process by which the government came to introduce this bill tells you a lot about how this government is run and what its priorities are. The government rhetoric around this bill tells you a lot about its politics and about the way it wants to conduct public debate. Most importantly, the substance of this little bill tells you a lot about this government's values and about what sort of country it wants to build.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his second reading speech the Minister for the Environment claimed that the bill is responsive to a trend of abuse of the EPBC Actâ€”what he claims is a pattern of behaviour by certain environmental activists. This is transparently not the case. The government has not established any such trend. They have produced no evidence of what they claim is a flood of vexatious litigation. No, this bill is responsive to just one incidentâ€”the orders of the Federal Court of Australia on 4 August this year relating to the Adani Carmichael project. We should be very clear about what the Federal Court did in that matter, because it is the genesis of this bill. Unusually, we have the assistance of a public statement of the court, released on 19 August, explaining the court's orders. In that statement the court explains that on 4 August a judge of the court set aside the decision of the Minister for the Environment to approve, under the EPBC Act, the Adani Carmichael project. Crucially, though, the court said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The orders were not made after a hearing. There was no judgment. There were no findings. The orders were made by consent, that is, with the agreement of the parties to the litigation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lawyers for the minister had written a letter to the court admitting that he had made an error in his approval decision. In making his decision the EPBC Act obliged him to consider advice about threatened species which a project might affect, but he had not done so in this instance. The minister, through his lawyers, conceded that this error invalidated the decision and asked the court to set it aside. As I said, it is unusual for the court to make a public statement about matters before it. Very diplomatically, the court said it did so in order to correct media reports about the Adani case. What happened, in fact, was that government had an almighty public tantrum. The orders of the Federal Court came about not because of any underhanded action by environmental activistsâ€”they were necessary, as the government itself admitted to the courtâ€”but because of an error the minister had made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an opportunistic government, however. It is a government which is desperate for a fight. It is desperate to distract from the paucity of its own agenda. Instead of simply remaking the decisionâ€”and this time considering all of the information which the act requiresâ€”the government lashed out at the decision and at the environmental group which had brought the application to the court. It engaged in the most hyperbolic kind of rhetoricâ€”which I will come to shortly. Instead of reflecting on its own ineptitudeâ€”the true cause of the adverse ruling by the courtâ€”it announced that it would change the law. This really is quite an extraordinary way to legislateâ€”though it is one we are fast becoming used to under this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am reminded of the crusade against the Racial Discrimination Act led by the Prime Minister and his Attorney-General in response to just one judgement by a single judge of the Federal Court concerning a single conservative opinion columnist. Because of that one judgementâ€”a judgement which the columnist in question did not seek to appeal in even the Full Court of the Federal Court, let alone the High Courtâ€”the government decided to repeal a provision which had served the community well for over two decades. This time they did not even have a judgement. As the court explained, there was no trial, no hearing, no findingsâ€”just a single set of consent orders setting aside one decision of the minister relating to one mining project. If the government has its way, this is to be the basis for changing the rules about challenging all projects under the EPBC Act, Australia's primary national environmental protection statute.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current standing provision, section 487, which this act would repeal, has been in place since the act itself was passed by the Howard government. The government has produced no evidence of any abuse of this provision, no evidence of litigation unfairly holding up any development. Since the EPBC Act commenced in July 2000, approximately 5,500 projects have been through the EPBC process. Of these, there have been 33 Federal Court challenges by third parties against only 22 projectsâ€”that is right: 22 projects, out of 5Â½ thousand. This equates to only 0.4 per cent of projects referred under the EPBC Act. Of the 33 actions, four were discontinued or resolved with the consent of the parties and six were legally successful in the sense that the applicant received a judgement or orders in its favour. Only one project was actually stopped. All the others were legally unsuccessful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The operation of the EPBC Act was last subjected to an independent review in 2009, led by respected former public servant Dr Allan Hawke and a panel of experts. That review considered section 487 and the other extended standing provisions in the act. This was the conclusion of the review led by Dr Hawke: 'These provisions created no difficulties and should be maintained.' The current government is evidently ignoring this finding. They have not conducted any review of their own. They have not produced any real evidence. They have not consulted. They have barely thought about it. This is a government that values ideology over evidence. They are interested in politics not policy. This is no way to legislate in this national parliament. It is no way to govern Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this government is not one to let the facts get in the way of a good slogan. With no evidence to back them up, they have engaged in some truly extraordinary rhetoric. They have spoken about 'vigilante litigation', a contradiction in terms if ever I saw one. They have slurred farmers and community groups as 'radical activists'. They accuse those who care about this country's environment of engaging in acts of 'sabotage'. And this is not coming from maverick backbenchers. It is not coming from the fringes of the Liberal and Nationals party rooms. This rhetoric is being spouted by cabinet ministers and by the Prime Minister himself. There is one minister in particular who ought to be singled out for this sort of language: the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. As first law officer, he should be restrained in the way he talks about the courts and about matters before them. He ought never to denigrate the role of the courts in holding the government of the day to the letter of the law, in what must be a new lowâ€”</span>

He should know what nonsense it is, and it is consistent with this government that they have no idea of how to properly conduct the affairs of Australia. It is absolutely consistent with their ignorance of parliamentary convention, their ignorance of conventions about royal commissions, that the parliamentary secretary would seek to compare a royal commission to a court.</span>

That is what we have come toâ€”just like the ridiculous statements government ministers have been making, falsely comparing a royal commission to a court.

                    </a>  and unhinged rhetoric like we are hearing now from the member for Corangamite tells us about this government is that it is a government that is desperate for a distraction. They are desperate to confect outrage, to pick a fight. It is a government boxing at shadows. The government's histrionics on this issue bear no relation to what this bill will actually achieve. The bill is not really about radical activists. It is not really about vexatious litigants or frivolous lawsuits. The courts already have powers under the general law to deal with vexatious applicants. They already have the ability to restrain abuses of their processes. It is an unjustified slur on the courts to suggest that they have not been using these powers appropriately.</span>

It would strip Australians of the right they presently have to challenge important government decisions which might have profound environmental consequences, including impacts on our food security, the tourism industry and the health and quality of life of those living in regional Australia. It would take away the rights of farmers, graziers and agribusinesses whose lands and water supplies are often threatened by the impacts of major projects. It is a retrograde step, but no-one should be surprised. This government has an appalling record on environmental issues.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister talked a big game when he was in opposition. In 2009 he said he was a 'fair dinkum environmentalist'. In 2010 he told the ABC:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As in so many other areas, the promises this government made before taking office have turned out to be completely illusory. In office, this government has waged an unrelenting war on Australia's environmentâ€”and, what's worse, on anyone who dares to try to defend it. In office, this Prime Minister turned out to be, as the respected international magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Foreign Policy</span> put it last year, 'the Australian environment's worst nightmare'. The Prime Minister destroyed Australia's carbon pricing scheme, something he boasts about endlessly. He asked UNESCO to delist 74,000 hectares of World Heritage forest in Tasmania, making Australia only the third country, after Oman and Tanzania, to try to abandon one of its own World Heritage sites.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Chillingly, though, a particular focus of this government has been on restraining public debate about environmental issues. The government wants to stifle activism and prevent the community from speaking out and organising around environmental causes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In December 2013, after being asked to do so by the Minerals Council, the Attorney-General cancelled all funding to environmental defenders offices. Through the House Standing Committee on the Environment, the government has been waging a campaign against the deductible gift recipient status of environmental organisations. The Liberal Party has already made its attitude to this quite clear. Last year, at the urging of the member for Bass, the federal Liberal council passed a motion calling for such organisations to lose their DGR status. The member for Bass said that the groups which defend our environment are not 'real charities'.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is just the latest salvo in that government campaign to silence the community, to silence those Australians who care about the environment, which I hope would be every Australian. Well, Labor will not stand for it. We will not allow this government to undermine the integrity of our environment protection laws. We will not let them cover up the Minister for the Environment's own incompetence with an attack on the rights of the community. I expect the people of Australia will not let them get away with it either.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The House should reject this bill, just as this House should reject the appalling attitudes which have been expressed by speaker after speaker from the government benches. They have demonstrated not the slightest understanding of the way our legal system is meant to work and not the slightest understanding even of the responsibilities of the national government to care for and protect our environment and to make it possible for all those in Australia who care about the environment to participate in ensuring that every development is in accordance with the law.</span>

If a radical activist is someone who will stand up for their community and organise with others in their community to stand up for the environment then that is what I am. I am a radical activist. Those opposite have not been shy this week about labelling people who care about the environment and labelling people who are prepared to make a contribution in causes around the environment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Standing) Bill 2015. What we have seen could be described as lively debate, but that implies being fleet of foot or mind, and I would argue that those opposite have been neither. Rather, the debate has been marked by a sledgehammer approach. We have had conflated rhetoric and people being accused of being vigilantes, vandals, saboteurs and of gaming a system. Going to the Federal Court is now gaming the system! This is a really important debate because it gives us an opportunity to lay out what the changes before us actually are and what has brought them before us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are talking about the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, which, as has been pointed out by many in this debate, has been in operation for some 15 years since it was introduced by Prime Minister John Howard. It provides a legal framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places defined in the act as matters of national environmental significance. As someone who represents an electorate with a Ramsar site, I stand here proudly to say that this act is critically important and should not be amended as suggested.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment bill seeks to repeal section 487, which will remove the ability of third parties to take action under the act and instead only allow persons who can meet the standing test in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. What does this mean in real terms? What does it mean to the people in my community? Currently, this law allows very specific groups and people to challenge an approval given by government where the processes have not been followed to the letter of the lawâ€”where an approval has been granted without meeting the requirements of the act. Generally, when an appeal is lodged the parties involved withdraw the approval and revisit the process until they can guarantee that it is legal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment bill removes the ability to do that from specific people. Currently, legal challenges are limited to community groups who have been active for at least two years. This amendment would mean that challenges would be limited to people who can prove they are directly affected. In real terms, they have to prove they are directly affected and have the funds and the courage to risk a massive costs order against them. What it means is that the errors in the approval process would go unchallenged. The act, as it stands, means that errors do not go unchallenged, that people are careful in deliberating in the approval processes, that environmental concerns are addressed appropriately and that mitigating measures are taken to ensure environmental protection. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But here we are, in the federal parliament, looking to undo that process. Let's have a look at the context. We are here because Minister Hunt made a mistake. Generally, if grown-ups make a mistake, they own it, they act to ameliorate the damage and they move on. But no. What we have seen from Minister Hunt is the throwing of the toys out of the cot. He has had a huge dummy-spit because he got something wrong. I would have thought that grown-up governments required grown-up ministers, not toddler tantrums like we have seen here. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have opened up a new front in the Abbott government's war on everything fair. This time it is the environmentalists are under attack. In reality, the EPBC Act, as it stands, delivers attention to detail, sensitive compromise and negotiated outcomes. Reason is what this act delivers. But this week we have heard speech after speech of scalding rhetoric. I have found listening to the speeches from those opposite over the last 48 hours personally affronting. I led a community campaign. I was chairperson of the Werribee Residents Against the Toxic Dump. This was a group of people concerned about the environmental impacts of a project that had the support of the Premier of the day, Jeff Kennett, and was being proposed by a huge company. CSR was the company. In leading that campaign I worked with a group of incredibly sensitive and reasonable people. I worked with a farmerâ€”a farmer, as it happenedâ€”who was very concerned about the damage to the reputation of the Werribee South growers and their produce. I worked with a suburban solicitor who was concerned that the people's voices were not being heard and that the processes were pitched against the community. I worked with an academicâ€”and I of course was a school teacher. We had a scientist on our committee. In fact, we had two scientists on our committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes that are being suggested today and the rhetoric being piled on during this week vilify people who have clear community concerns and they pigeon-hole people from my community as wild 'mung bean eating vandals'â€”that was one of the quotes yesterday. A few people in my community may have eaten mung beans, but I have not. The people on the group I chaired were concerned about potential damage, real damage, to the groundwater that is used to water the crops in Werribee South. Those people were prepared to take whatever action was required. That included a trip to Canberra to see if, given the danger to the Ramsar wetland, the federal government were interested in our cause.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it offensive, and I know that all the people in my community who were involved in that campaign will have found it equally offensive, to have heard concerned citizens typecast in this way. We were residents, we were farmers, we were people critically concerned about our community and about our environmentâ€”and we did all the evil things be ranted about. We took action. We took every action we could to ensure our voices were heard. We were on the consultative committees. We did seek what legal avenues were open to us. We worked closely with the Geelong Environmental Defenders Office. We sought legal advice from that group. We sought their expertise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are discussing today is about taking away a community's right to seek explicit expertise in environmental matters if they have a problem with a proposal in their area. We have heard lots of rhetoric like, 'You should be in the immediate vicinity', and we have heard lots of rhetoric about people taking action from thousands of miles away. The EPBC Act is exactly what this country needs to ensure that people thousands of miles away can express their concerns, can seek redress, can be involved in the process, and can ensure that the approval process ticks every box under the act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt in my mind that this in fact another war for this governmentâ€”someone else to pick a fight withâ€”and their overblown rhetoric camouflages the fact that they want to change something that was introduced under the Howard government, something that has worked for 15 years, and which, as speaker after speaker has said, has resulted in one project being stopped. The fact that these provisions are in the act ensure that those involved in the process are able to make sure that their due diligence is done appropriately. They ensure that the approval process has followed the law. That is what is important here. To those people from the Mackay Conservation Group, the grassroots community-based organisation from North Queensland which is run by a group of dedicated volunteers, I say, 'Keep up the good work' and 'If you need expert advice from the New South Wales Environmental Defenders Office, seek it, because it reflects the same work I did as a concerned citizen of my community some years ago.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">History shows that the EPBC Act, as it stands, ensures that processes are followed. It ensures community voices are heard. It ensures approvals are not corrupted. This bill is dangerous legislation. It seeks to circumvent natural justice and disempower the public of Australia. It seeks to silence communities when they are critically concerned and critically involved. In fact, I would go further and say that it will limit community involvement. Community activism is a good thing, not a bad thing. Having people informed and involved in the debates around major projects ensures that a community goes with a project when it gets ultimate approval. I suggest strongly that those opposite rethink this mad war on environmentalists.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  Like other concerned members and the members of the Labor Party, I too would like to lend my voice to opposing the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Standing) Bill 2015, which seeks to amend section 487 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are very good reasons for opposing this legislation, and it is not because we are trying to give voice to people who are not entitled to a voice. It is not that we are trying to sponsor a reform through litigation. It is solely because, if this passes the House, we will limit the ability of individuals, communities and, yes, environmental groups to challenge large-scale development projects that will impact on the environment under the federal law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the last 15 years, this act has been Australia's principal piece of legislation for environmental protection. It was introduced in 2000 by John Howardâ€”hardly the greatest rogue environmentalist, tree-hugging prime minister this nation has ever seen. This piece of legislation in 2000 showed that he had a vision for preservation of environmental concerns. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation provides the legal framework to protect and manage national and internationally important flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places, which are defined in the act as matters of national environmental significance. Apart from other things that that government did, including Work Choices, we on this side of the House would actually call this act a positive contribution to our nation's future and the preservation of our environment for future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since its enactment, there have been approximately 5,500 projects that have been through the EPBC process. Of these, only 33 Federal Court challenges by third parties against 22 projects eventuated. Interestingly, when you look at those 5Â½ thousand projects, they equate to 0.4 per cent of projects referred under the act. Of the 33 actions, four were discontinued or resolved with the consent of the parties, six were legally successful, one project was actually stopped and the rest were unsuccessful. This amendment is not exactly responding to something that the courts have been inundated with. It is not responding to something where mischievous judges have overturned projectsâ€”one was stopped.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the year 2000, a few things have occurred, including the mining boom. This act, including section 487, has been in force then. I think most would conclude, from those statistics that I just gave, that it has not threatened the viability of those projects. Therefore this project to repeal the enabling provisions of the EPBC Act is just another relentless attack by this government on the environment and the groups that take seriously the protection of the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, under Australia's EPBC Act, anyone who is adversely affected by a decision or failure to make a decision has the legal right to challenge the project. This includes any Australian citizen, resident or organisation established in Australia who have acted 'for protection or conservation of or research into the environment' any time in the two years before the decision was made. That sounds fair enough; you have to establish some credibility hereâ€”not just any old Tom, Dick and Harry but people who have been involved in research to be demonstrated over the two years prior to a decision being made. However, the proposed changes will restrict the ability of these third parties to challenge the approval of a mine or another major industrial development and limit those challenges to only those directly affected by a development such as the immediate landholder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment will not only restrict but it will move to ensure that various environmental groups, farming groups and certainly local communities with a genuine interest in not only development but also what precedes the developmentâ€”the status of the environment and its impactâ€”will no longer have a voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Government's decision to amend the EPBC Act and restrict third-party appeals has arisen in response to the Adani Carmichael project in Queensland's Galilee Basin. This $16.5 million project is significant</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and was approved by the environment minister in 2014 but was then later set aside following a challenge by the Mackay Conservation Group. The Federal Court's decision to set this project aside was based not on a specific environmental challenge but the failure of the minister now at the table to comply with his own lawâ€”namely, to properly consider the impact of the Carmichael mine on the Great Barrier Reef, taking into account vulnerable species as well as Adani's environmental track record.</span>

                    </a>  It was that kind of errorâ€”and my colleague can address it when he gives his replyâ€”and cavalier attitude to the decision-making process that was finally fatal to the potential and threatened biodiversity and ecological communities such as those surrounding the Galilee Basin. However, it appears the government has not learned the lessons. To remove the provision is simply going to silence those whose sole fallback position is to exercise their rights in the courts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly there are many people this government does not trust, including those on our side of politics, community activists and environmental activists, but they also clearly do not trust the courts themselves. Therefore, this is not only designed to limit litigation but also to keep the judges from meddling in determining whether or not provisions have been complied with. To some extent, you almost see this as being an attack on the freedom of speech or on democracy by the executive trying to silence the judiciary having any involvement. Amongst everything else, it is stripping rights from our communities and those who actually believe in the health and preservation of our environment.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I really needed that protection too. He might be an able medium-pace bowler, but I'm not sure he's an able environment minister!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While not directly affected, we had an issue in my own electorate which is analogous to what is occurring here. It is not directly impacted by this legislation. The conservative government of New South Wales took a very similar approach to what the minister is doing here, but they decided to move 5,800 tonnes of radioactive waste from Hunters Hill on the North Shore in a conservative electorate to a facility in Kemps Creek, Western Sydney, on the boundaries of my electorate. The view was that this could create hazardsâ€”long-term issues, health issuesâ€”for the people of North Sydney. If you were north of the harbour, that was a consideration. Therefore, they could move that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even the then premier himself admitted that the radioactive waste was seven times above the acceptable limits, it was certainly too dangerous to leave it where it wasâ€”in North Sydney, that isâ€”and they were looking for a more appropriate place to put it: in the backyard of the people of Western Sydney. That is how they approached it. Fortunately, apart from the 5,000 residents various conservation groups, scientists, school communities and everybody else came together to cause the government to stop that. If they had the ability at that stage, they would have banded their resources and gone to court to stop that, because people in Western Sydney were generally very concerned about themselves, their families and the future of their local environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, the issue of trying to silence third parties and take away third-party appeal rights is not the way to go. Third-party appeals and third-party interests actually create a stronger incentive for proponents of these projects and governments not only to adhere to the law but to get their assessments right. It also builds on community confidence in the planning system, guards against corruption and results in better environmental assessment outcomes for all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all have a direct interest in making sure projects like the Adani Carmichael mine project are properly assessed and screened to minimise adverse impacts to the wider community and environment and for generations to come. However, in this government we see a direct interest only in protecting a certain degree of interestsâ€”the interests of large mining companiesâ€”as opposed to enforcing the law for all. If these changes go ahead, not only will the new amendments undermine the basic justice and fairness for, in this case, rural communities but really for any communities who are now facing off against some of the biggest companies and mining enterprises in the world; but it will also impact to the detriment of community health, social wellbeing and the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When will this government start enforcing its own laws so the community does not have to? That is the basis for our opposition to this amendment.</span>

I would also like to thank in particular Senator Brandis for driving this legislation. This bill repeals section 487 of the EPBC Act and, effectively, standing will therefore be covered under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, as is the ordinary case across the Commonwealth. In particular it brings the standing under the EPBC Act into line with other Commonwealth legislation under the AD(JR) Act. By the way, this is exactly the standard which the ALP actively supported when supporting legislation for Western Sydney airport. The ALP recently voted for precisely this standard, precisely this level of standing in the Western Sydney airport.</span>

I know that the member for Grayndler finds it a little inconvenient that he recently voted in support of exactly this level of standing and mechanism not just without demur but with active support for the legislationâ€”and we thank him for his active support for that legislation. I would have thought that that principle applied to everybody. Clearly, it is a case of picking and choosing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me finish on this situation. The position is absolutely clear: this amendment bill will prevent those with no connection to the project other than a political ambition to frustrate decisions made under the EPBC Act, which have been made subject to the most rigorous environmental approvals, from using the courts to 'disrupt and delay projects' that have been appropriately considered under the EPBC Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also note that, on the advice I have, there has not been a single case under section 487 of the EPBC Act of a farmer seeking to bring action and relying on that as standing. The farmers' right is fundamentally enshrined and protected, and the neighbours' right is fundamentally enshrined and protected under the EPBC Act, through the AD(JR) Act. For the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act, let me make this statement: this amendment will maintain, protect and endorse the rights of those with a genuine and direct interest in a matter, such as farmers and landowners. It maintains, protects and endorses their rights, as should be the case. For these reasons I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  The second anniversary of the election of the Abbott government was a celebration for no-one nowhere. And nowhere was that more true than in rural and regional Australia where the coalition's unfair and irrational budget cuts have hit hardest. Since the election of this government, country Australia has gone backwards. Unemployment is up, apprenticeships and other training opportunities are in decline, spatial inequality is growing, and our local councils are poorer due to cuts in Financial Assistance Grants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When governments cut health funding, cut GP rebates, cut childcare funding, cut schools funding, cut higher education funding, cut unemployment and training assistance, cut local government grants, cut ABC funding, cut Landcare funding, cut funding for community support groups, and increase university fees, those measures hit hardest on rural and regional Australia. They fall disproportionately and adversely upon rural and regional Australia. But this is what this conservative government has done over the course of the last two years, without any concern for people living outside of our capital cities and without any fight from any of those National Party MPs and Liberals representing rural seats on that side lifting a finger to assist their constituents. We will hold the member for Riverina to account. We will hold all those members to account on that side who have done nothing for their electorate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  In recent months I have enjoyed supporting a number of local sports games and local sports clubs watching high-quality netball. It was a pleasure to attend the St Michael's and All Angels Netball Club and the Grange Baptist Uniting Netball Club presentation dinners recently. As a proud supporter of both clubs, it was great to see both finished off the season with a number of premierships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">St Michael's and All Angels held their end-of-season event recently and, as a club sponsor, I was fortunate to be able to present the Diamond Award to Madeline Cole for her 14 years continuous service to the netball club. I was honoured to join Michelle Diamond, whom the award is named after, to present this award to a very deserving recipient. The presentation ceremony was a wonderful evening. Congratulations to Bronwyn Britcher, Amanda Durbin, John McGeagh, the hard-working committee and the club on a great year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the same night, I was also fortunate to present medallions to the Grange Uniting Netball Club's Lorna Godfrey Shield winners for the 2015 season. Lorna Godfrey is a true legend of the Grange Uniting Netball Club. She was one of club's inaugural players, umpire, coach and committee member. It was another great evening with hundreds of people in attendance. I would like to acknowledge President Jim Davis and congratulate him and the Grange Baptist Uniting Netball Club on their success in 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to also pay tribute to the Sparkling Diamonds Netball Club at Brooklyn Park on their efforts this season and especially acknowledge their success in welcoming migrants to their teams. At one of the games I saw a few weeks ago, it was wonderful to see girls from Africa enjoy their game of netball. Well done to all clubs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  On Saturday, September 26 Labor will be holding our Country Labor Forum in Casino. The fact is rural and regional Australia have been abandoned by the Abbott government. But Labor's country forum will bring members from across the regions to talk about the policies and plans we need.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott government policies continue to hurt rural Australia. You know what? In the regions, we blame the National Party for this betrayal. We blame the Nationals for the cuts to hospitals. We have seen them cut $50 billion cut from hospitals. We also blame the Nationals for cuts to education. We have seen $30 billion cut from schools, and we condemn this government's unfair plans for $100,000 university degrees. We also blame the Nationals for funding cuts to local councils and unfair cuts to regional development.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has no plans or understanding as to how to address the challenges facing regional Australia, particularly the very high unemployment levels. All this government has is a line-up of weak and shallow National Party members who sell out the country every chance they get. The fact is the Nationals do not tell the truth and they cannot be trusted at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows that investing in regional Australia is critically important for local communities, not just for the facilities that will be provided but also for the creation of local jobs and economic activity, because the fact is Labor will always back regional and rural Australia, unlike the National Party, who sell out country Australia every single opportunity they get.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Yesterday marked a special day in our history when Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II became the longest-serving sovereign, surpassing the 63 year, seven months and two-day reign of her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria. It was therefore a great pleasure for me to be present at the national ecumenical service at St Paul's Manuka this morning to recognise this occasion. The welcome was given by my colleague Senator Dean Smith, who was largely responsible for organising this memorable service, which was full of glorious music.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Marking this milestone allows us the opportunity to appreciate the constitutional system that we have in place in Australia, which has served our country and people so well over 114 years. To those who desire a republic, I still ask the same questions: what is the nature of the republic you propose? And how will it benefit the people of Australia? I am still awaiting an answer to both of those questions. We hear the cry that Republicans want an Australian head of state. Well, there is no doubt that our head of state is our Governor-General. Her Majesty is our titular head, which means our head of state is appointed in an apolitical way. It simply remains to say on this occasion that our Governor-General, His Excellency Sir Peter Cosgrove, is clearly an Australian and does an outstanding job of head of state, ably assisted by Her Excellency Lady Cosgrove.</span>

While some in the community are concerned that we are not doing enough for our own homeless citizens, we do have the support networks. In times of crisis, the Gilmore community have shown their strength and commitment to help others. Recent events like the Shoalhaven Homelessness Shark Tank are an example of this. In terms of international crisis, the government has decided to assist 12,000 Syrian refugees to settle in Australia. Already people in Gilmore have offered to help them to become part of our community. Our first local information session will take place tomorrow, and there are dozens of residents eager to help.</span>

This organisation provides boxes which contain first-survival needs for people who are refugees without any resources at all. The boxes come with a tent, blankets, eating utensils, a basic tool kit, water carriers, purification tablets and other items appropriate for the destination. I take this opportunity to repeat my challenge to all Rotary clubs in Australiaâ€”possibly around the worldâ€”and other community groups who are equally concerned with this Syrian refugee crisis. Go to the ShelterBox website, locate my team challenge and make a contribution. Small or large, all will be welcome. It goes straight to the ShelterBox organisation to help supply these lifesaving amenities. Each contribution will help to alleviate the suffering for these people.</span>

Particularly where it has let down regional Australia is in the area of manufacturing. Time and time again, we hear stories about how this government is turning its back on manufacturing. The Bushmaster is manufactured in my electorate. We are the proud makers of the Bushmasterâ€”built, developed and tested in Bendigo. We are at the end of the Bushmaster and we are now waiting for the next contract to be signed. We are the proud makers of the Hawkei. We want to go into production, but we are waiting on this government to sign that Hawkei contract so we can go into manufacturing. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  This week is a great week for Western Australia because, on the AFL ladder, the Dockers are first and the West Coast Eagles are second. It is going to be a great weekend in which we celebrate our national sport. I want to acknowledge my rival club, which is Julie Bishop's club, the Eagles. Let us hope that the players for the final eight teams, who have put in all the energy and effort to make sure their teams get there, enjoy the moment. But what is more important is the way in which they win. I know that, for our economy, having the two preliminary finals in Western Australia this weekend will be fantastic, and I intend to go to both games. I felt saddened for Mike Bowers, who was up in the gallery wearing a Sydney Swans scarf, because, as I said to him, 'The Dockers will clean you up.' But all the best to all the players, and I am looking forward to the grand final being between the Dockers and the West Coast Eagles, because they have worked hard for it. I want to acknowledge the young players who have come through the season for all the clubs. Their heart, compassion and commitment have taken their teams to the levels that they are at. I was sitting with Kevin Sheedy last night, and we were talking about football and the fun and enjoyment that we all get out of it. I look forward to a fantastic weekend and I feel sorry for those who will lose against the Eagles and the Dockers!</span>

Regional towns are hit hard by the actionsâ€”and inactionâ€”of this government, and those sitting over there should hang their heads in shame. The impact of their policies has a direct effect on the young people living in regional communities. According to the Brotherhood of St Laurence <span style="font-style:italic;">My</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> chance, </span><span style="font-style:italic;">our </span><span style="font-style:italic;">future</span> report, youth unemployment has reached a crisis point in regional towns. In McEwen, there are about 25,000 young people in the 18- to 29-year-old age bracket. Youth unemployment is at 20 per cent in towns like Seymour, Kilmore and Broadford. It is the fifth worst in Australia. These are good towns, with decent people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what did this government do? It ripped the guts out of services and programs that help these young people to find jobs. Since its election, the Abbott 'opposition' government has been systematically tearing down job opportunities in regional Australia. Unless you are a mining magnate, this government is not interested in building prosperity and futures for our regional communities. It is not interested in growing towns and communities and building economic growth across the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The results are clear. Unemployment was 5.7 per cent when this government came to office. It peaked at 5.9 per cent during the global financial crisis. Now it is at 6.2 per cent. Unemployment is now higher now than it was during the global financial crisis. People know this government is a failure when the flailing Treasurer bellows about his great work. This government has failed regional Australia, and regional Australia knows it. Labor knows investing in regional Australia is critically important for local communities, not just for the facilitiesâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  Almost 100 years ago, a group of men marched from Wagga Wagga to Sydney, through much of the electorate of Hume, to sign up recruits for the Great War. The war was underway, but casualties were high. In this centenary year, a re-enactment of the Kangaroo March has just got underway. I think today they are arriving in Bethungra, and they will be stopping in towns and villages along the way over the next four weeks. The then member for Hume, Robert Patten, walked the whole way with the men. They started with 88 recruits and finished with over 300. The current member for Humeâ€”that is meâ€”has parliament next week, so I will not be able to join them the whole way, but I will be joining in this Sunday, from Cootamundra to Wallendbeen, and on a couple of legs later in the journey. I will be riding my horse Whiskey, accompanied by about 20 members of the Australian Light Horse. I have copped a bit of flak about how Whiskey looks and his age. He is 15 years old, but he is a small, hardy stockhorse. That was the type of animal the men took with them on their way to warâ€”the solid, reliable stockhorses.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  Regional and rural communities have borne much of the burden of the Abbott government's incompetence and mismanagement of the Australian economy. Regional and rural communities already face disadvantages and barriers that most city dwellers do not, so their difficulties are amplified because of the Abbott government's decisions. No sector better understands that than the councils who have been hit exceptionally hard by the Abbott government's freezing of indexation of financial assistance grants, which cut a billion dollars of funding to the local government sector across Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Councils are often one of the largest employers and job-creation entities within regional and rural communities. They do not have many other revenue options, so cutting their federal funding directly impacts on the services, the construction projects and the local jobs that they can generate. Likewise, cuts to health and education, community front-line services, the ABC and SBS and, for South Australia, the cut of $18 million to the supplementary local road funding which had been made available to that state for years have also had a disproportionate effect on country Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott government has neglected country Australia because it takes the vote of country folks for granted and thinks that just throwing them a few scraps every now and then is all it needs to do. It is another example of the arrogance of the Abbott government and its disconnect with the Australian people.</span>

What we are hearing today is an attack on what is happening in regional Australia. I want to talk about what is happening in my electorate, a National Party electorate, where $350 million has been poured into this electorate in less than two years. We are building a $120 million irrigation project. We have just approved the build of 22 mobile phone towersâ€”towers that did not get any funding at all under the previous Labor government. We have got an extra $20 million a year, going from $10 million to now $30 million a year, into our local governments to build country roads. We have built and got funding for $2 million for the Longerenong College to encourage young people to get training in agriculture. </span>

We are still waiting on the Victorian Labor government to commit their one-third. The community has raised a million dollars. The Abbott government has given a million dollars. The Labor government in Victoria has given nothing. We have given a million dollars for the Heartbeat of the Murray program to encourage tourism; $10 million for the Grampians Peaks Trail to have tourism in the Grampiansâ€”please come and visit it; and $1.75 million for a dark-matter laboratory so we can do some research to get high-end research to eliminate cancer. We are delivering for regional Australia and it is the National Party that is doing it.</span>

Day. It is the time that we encourage all Australians to reach out to a friend, a family member or a colleague and ask a simple question, 'Are you okay?' Around 400,000 Australians think about taking their own life each year; 2Â½ thousand deaths by suicide occur in our country each year; and suicide is the No. 1 cause of death for Australians aged between 15 and 44. It takes a devastating toll on communities in regional and rural Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mental health, depression or anxiety can affect any one of us and all of us have known, loved or mourned someone who has taken their life. So often these deaths come as a complete shock to even the closest of friends and family members. We say to each other, 'We just could not have guessed; there was no way to know.' But there is actually, just ask. Taking the time to listen, asking a simple question, showing someone you care, showing someone that they are not on their own could change a life, it could even save a life. So not just today but each and every day, let's ask someone, 'Are you okay?'</span>

To each and every one of these organisations, I thank them for their commitment to our community on the Central Coast in assisting foster carers and the foster carers' families.

There are a range of procedures in place to ensure that the measures and the activities we are undertaking are both successful and safe. We recognise, however, that in all war theatres there is danger and we certainly wish our troops and our airmen a safe journey back to Australia.

                  </a>  China, with 1.3 billion people, is the biggest market in the world. Now Australia, through the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, has the opportunity to participate more fully in that market. It is already our biggest trading partner, with our annual two-way trade exceeding $150 billion. It is Australia's largest export market for agricultural products, with about $100 billion worth of product going to China each year. With China accounting for 43 per cent of global growth in agricultural demand by 2050, this agreement is just so important to the future of Australia's trade and the prosperity of Australian agriculture. When the agreement is fully in place, 95 per cent of our exports to China will be tariff free. That will mean greater opportunities, greater advantages, for Australian exports into that market. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most Australians and most Australian leaders in industry and in governments are vigorously supporting this agreement. They want it to happen. They know it is good for our country. One by one they have been speaking up and giving advice to those opposite that they need to support this agreement in the interests of our country. I was interested to read today that former ALP president Warren Mundine has joined past and present premiers, Labor and coalition, in supporting this agreement. Certainly Warren Mundine made it absolutely clear where the Labor Party has been on this position and how unsatisfactory it is. In commenting on the union campaign against the China-Australia FTA, he said:</span>

The government's decision to take 12,000 refugees from this crisis area is a humanitarian gesture that we have been able to make. It is one that we believe reflects the will of Australian people to again do what we can to provide safe haven for those who have little or no hope of ever returning to their country and living with any kind of reasonable lifestyle. We have said that we want to bring those people to Australia as soon as possible. We will be dispatching a team of Australian officials to assist the UNHCR to identify people who are suitable for transfer to Australia. We will be doing that quickly, and we would like to see these people come to Australia just as quickly as we can.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to acknowledge that it will take time to undertake this processing. We need to ensure that, firstly, these are people that the UNHCR have recognised are indeed genuine refugees. We have to do the security checks that are associated with these kinds of arrangements and then make a suitable arrangement to bring them to Australia. We will commence this process just as quickly as we can. Twelve thousand is a large intake, and so clearly it is going to take some time, but our objective is to do it as quickly as possible.</span>

Each year we trade about $150 billion worth of goods and services with China. They spend $100 billion on our goods and services; we spend $50 billion on their goods and services. So it works in our favour by two to one. The trade agreement that we have with China today is going to make that even better, and it ends up delivering more jobs and better paying jobs, and we welcome that. As the member for Macquarie was telling me a little bit earlier today, Scenic World in her electorateâ€”a number of us have been there over the yearsâ€”last year had a 36 per cent increase in the number of Chinese visitors, to nearly 155,000 Chinese visitors.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are doing all of this to create more jobs and better jobs for everyday Australians, and I am very pleased with the data released from the Australian Bureau of Statistics today about the unemployment numbers in Australia. There is still much work to be done, but, even with the volatility that goes from month to month, the fact is that over the last three months, since the 'have a go' budget, nearly 60,000 jobs have been created in Australia. Sixty thousand jobs have been created in Australia in the last three months. How many jobs do you think were created in the last three months after the last Labor budget? Twenty thousand? Ten thousand? Five thousand? One thousand? It was 500â€”500 jobs in three months after the last budget from the member for Lilley, compared to nearly 60,000 jobs in the three months since our last budget, and the 500 jobs he created ended up as branch members. And do you know what? The workforce participation rate is higher now than it was when the Labor Party left government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we are delivering more jobsâ€”more than 300,000 jobs created since we came to government. We are delivering better jobs with higher wages. We are delivering more opportunities with a free trade agreement that is going to open the doors of prosperity to more and more Australians. The only threat to more jobs and better jobs is the Australian Labor Party, and I say again to the Labor Party: get out of the way of the free trade agreement and help us to build a more prosperous Australia.</span>

The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement is a comprehensive agreement. That is what is so remarkable about this agreement. This is the first time that China has agreed to a trade arrangement of this nature with a developed economy of Australia's breadth and depth. This is a remarkable agreement because it is so comprehensive.</span>

                  </a>  And it does deal with some things that are not in other agreements. That would hardly be a surprise, because there are different priorities. But what this agreement does is protect Australian job standards. It protects the rights of Australians to work in positions of their choice. It gives the opportunity for Australians to also participate in the economy in China. We are able to undertake services and activities in China as a result of this agreement which were not possible under previous arrangements, especially the expansion of service industries into China. There will be jobs created for Australians in China, and it seems that the trade union movement, in its scare campaign, does not want to talk about those sorts of things. But let me assure you that unqualified people will not be allowed to work in Australia. The electricians and others have made it clear through their professional associations that the standards will be applied to anyone coming from other parts of the world to work here, just as happens to Australians who want to work in those professions. This is not a way to undermine our standards as a country; it is a way to create new jobs, more jobs and more opportunities for Australians as we grow our export markets into that part of the world and embrace the opportunities that there are in a trading arrangement of this nature with the fastest growing economy in the world.</span>

Her husband fled Syria, hoping to find refuge and then bring the family to safety. He made it to Australia but has spent the last two years locked up in detention centres, and he is now having heart attacks. Please, Minister, will you do the appropriate checks and let this family live reunited in Australia in safety and freedom?</span>

That is the case because the persecuted minorities have the least opportunity of ever returning to their ancestral homes.

But, just as all wars and conflicts occur, at some stage, God willing, this will come to an end and many of those people will be able to return to their homes. But we know that those who will be least likely to be able to return to their homes will be persecuted minorities, and therefore we believe that the compassionate act of generosity from this country should first and foremost be directed to those people. As for the case in question, I will refer that matter to the minister when he returns.</span>

As he knows, all three of our North Asian free trade agreements are an investment in Australian jobs and an investment in the future of the prosperity of our nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Independent modelling shows the three free trade agreements with China, Japan and Korea are worth over $24 billion in total additional income to Australia between 2016 and 2035. It shows that the agreements will result in an annual boost to the economy of $2.4 billion over the next 20 years. It shows that, under these agreements, there will be an increase in wages and jobs for Australians, yet Labor opposes the China free trade agreement and the jobs it will bring. The Leader of the Opposition seems to have signed up to a union campaign along the lines that unskilled Chinese workers will steal Australian jobs. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, they have been called out today by no less than Warren Mundine, a former president of the Australian Labor Party. It is worth reading the article that was published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian Financial Review</span>, because you should squirm. As Warren Mundine said:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Like protectionist arguments of old, the campaign is dressed up in economicsâ€”protecting Australian jobs. It's a nonsense argument built on misinformation and lies. And federal Labor is indulging it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The clear messageâ€”ChAFTA will flood Australia with Chinese workers destroying Australian jobs and the Chinese are not to be trusted. It's an antagonistic, "them against us" message, pandering to xenophobia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the China free trade agreement will not allow unrestricted access to the Australian labour market by Chinese workers.  It will not allow Australian employment laws or conditions to be undermined, and it will not allow companies to avoid paying Australian wages by using foreign workers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think the words of Warren Mundine should resonate with all on this side of the House when we look at the shameful, gormless creatures on the other side:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ the bigoted anti-ChAFTA campaign makes me deeply angry. It's embarrassing watching Labor dance around why they oppose ChAFTA when they didn't oppose similar deals with other countries; or why the labour-market testing regime isn't good enough for Chinese companies when it's good enough for everyone else.</span>

As someone who was born and bred in northern Tasmania, he really holds his electorate close to his heart. It is the largest electorate in Tasmania. He had incredible success in the awards last night with the Kondinin Group. In fact, I believe that Carol Bracken, from Glengarry, who was one of the runners-up last night, is with us here in the parliament today in the galleryâ€”somewhere up next to the Mayor of Tamworth, who is also up there at the moment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the big issues associated with the free trade agreement is that it has shown proven success in other countries, such as New Zealand. If we look at the results with respect to the products that are available in the member for Lyons' area, we see that we have proven success in the other trade agreements that we have done with Japan and Korea. Let's look, for instance, at table grapes. Since we signed the Korean free trade agreement, from January to June this year, we have moved in $2 million worth. We can also look at other successes. From January to June 2014, before we signed the Korean free trade agreement, we exported $2.3 million worth of macadamia nuts. After we signed the free trade agreement with Korea, it was $6.3 million. From January to June 2014, before we signed the free trade agreement with Japan, we exported $0.4 million worth of almonds. From January to June 2015, after we signed the free trade agreement with Japan, it was $1.6 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No matter where we go, we can see that these free trade agreements have a real impact, a definite impact, on returns to these regional areas. A great working example of that, of course, is New Zealand, who signed a free trade agreement in 2008. Before that, their exports were worth less than a billion dollars. They went from less than a billion in 2008 to $6.7 billion in 2014. If we look at a whole range of their products, we see that they have had a substantial increase. For instance, before they signed the free trade agreement, dairy products were at $321 million a year and now they are at $4.2 billion a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So who would be against this Free Trade Agreement? Obviously the love child of Norm Gallagher and the BLF, the CFMEU, is against this free trade agreement. And who is channelling Norm Gallagher and the CFMEU? The Australian Labor Party areâ€”against everybody; against Jay Weatherill and against Premiers in every state. When are they going to wake up?</span>

                  </a>  I was asked why it was so important for our economy that the China deal enters into force. If Australia plays its cards correctly, the next 30 years can literally be spectacularâ€”setting up for growth and prosperity throughout the century and beyond. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can say to my colleague who asked the question, northern Australia can also be a big part of that success. And the reason is, according to the OECD, a surging middle class in the region around us will see 600 million people today class grow to three billion people, not in 100 years, not in 50 years, but in the next 35 years. It is hanging there as a major prospect of prosperity and growth for all of us over the next 30 years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The transformation is happening now. Last year 100 million Chinese left China for a holiday, and a million came to Australia. China expects 200 million people by 2020â€”again, just five years awayâ€”to leave China for a holiday. The transformation in the region is well underway, and the coalition has seen, unlike those opposite, that these three free trade export agreements with Korea, Japan and Chinaâ€”and, ultimately, with Indiaâ€”are a major bridge to the extraordinary opportunities that are emerging on our doorstep. They are a crucial part of the government's plan to diversify our economy post the mining boom. </span>

                  </a>  if you listen you'll find outâ€”with Korea and Japan, in the six months since we entered into force those agreements, food and beverage exports to these countries have increased by 22 per cent and eight per cent respectively. At the same time, exports in those two categories out of China stalled to zero. Now, that just shows the great capacity of these agreements to increase the wealth and prosperity of all Australians in a most material way, but you have to put in place the structures. These agreements are the structures to make that â€¦<span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

There is nothing to negotiate, because you have not identified one thing. This has gone through JSCOT. It is going through the Senate inquiry. It has gone through all sorts of intermediaries, all sorts of research groups and others. Every one of them has confirmed that what we did in this deal is identical to what the worker protections were under the Korean deal, the Japanese deal and the Chile deal. All of those things are identical, and you have not laid a glove on this bill. That is why you are carrying on with that nonsensical question.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Small Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:40</span>):  Not only have we delivered the biggest jobs and small business package in our nation's history; we are now opening the door to hundreds of millions of new prospective customers. As for the member for Barton, very ably representing the more than 13Â½ thousand businesses in his electorate: they are looking to export into this North Asian opportunity, which is a delicious world of possibilities for our businesses. When you think about the fact that there is $100 billion worth of goods going to China under the agreement that Minister Robb has negotiated, 95 per cent of our exports to China will be tariff-free when this agreement is fully into effect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is great news for small business and for farming and family enterprises, and it is worth remembering that 90 per cent of Australia's exporters are SMEs but by value it is only five per cent of our export earnings. So there is an enormous opportunity, given that high degree of SME engagement in exports into North Asia and particularly into China, to grow that economic activity and to see the jobs and prosperity flow from it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are a couple of examples from the member's electorate. Frutex are currants and raisin exportersâ€”a great business in the local member's electorate already exporting into Asia but wanting to do more, and they will be able to do more and be encouraged by this trade agreement. Fardoulis Chocolatesâ€”I tell you they are unrivalled in reputation for crafting superior, distinctive and great-tasting chocolates. They are looking to delight more citizens in North Asia, including many of the 900,000 visitors from China who come to our country, participate in our economy and are delighted by what we do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These agreements are very important to shift from the mining boom to the dining boom, but let's not forget how spectacular the service opportunities are under these agreements. We know that services are 70 per cent of our domestic economy, though only 17 per cent of our export incomeâ€”another enormous opportunity for Australian businesses. This is not about exporting things but about exporting knowhow, education and training in the financial services sector, telecommunications sector, and health and ageing. It is a great opportunity for Australian small businesses, and we should get behind it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have done a bit of research and I have realised why the Leader of the Opposition is not a fan of this agreement. When he was the tsar of the AWU, at the 2004 Victorian Labor Party conference he seconded a motion moved by his union mate Dave Oliver to oppose the trade dealâ€”not any particular deal but even trying to negotiate a deal. This shows you what is wrong with this opposition leader. This is why this xenophobic campaign needs to be stared down and defeated. It is not the detail of the deal being negotiated; Labor hates the idea of any deal with China. They want to shut the door to these opportunities. It is on the record there from 2004. You need to change your way, Leader of the Opposition. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Regarding the request that Labor is making, there is not a cigarette paper of difference between the worker protections in this China deal and all the other deals that we have done, including those under Labor. There is not a cigarette paper of difference between them. There is no substance to your arguments. You have tried for weeks now, and no-oneâ€”forget about us, but no-one outsideâ€”has confirmed the arguments and the cases that you are putting, because when they go into the depth of it they find that the regulations and the requirements are identical. Secondly, if we start to put a bill down, you have a list of requirements as long as your arm. That is the other complication.

                  </a>  As a person who has spent a long time farming, he knows the benefits of this FTA and what it will provide to our primary industries in Australia, not only our agricultural industries but our mining and resources industries as well. Under the FTA, 95 per cent of our exports to China, such as wine, beef, seafood, lamb and of course resources, will be entirely duty-free. An elimination of tariffs on coal, for instance, and other minerals will earn this country and the companies involved some $600 million. That is exactly what the mining industry needs right nowâ€”no delay; right nowâ€”so that we can ensure that they remain viable and continue to employ Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only is the deal good for Australians, but Australians recognise that it is good for them. Sally McPherson, who runs a Queensland-based earthmoving equipment business called iSeekplant, which employs some 17 people, said recently: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The China deal will make mining more competitive and that will be good for jobs in Australian businesses like oursâ€”</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">referring to her businessâ€”and:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A delay to the trade deal will stall that investment and jobs growth, with enormous consequences for our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a businessperson saying it like it is. As the member for Parkes knows, I was recently twice in his electorate, to open two coalmines. One was the Idemitsu mine, which is a $360 million investment that employs local people and supports local businesses. As well as that we saw the Whitehaven Maules Creek mine open just recently. Along with the $767 million investment and the 450 jobs that it providedâ€”the most important feature of those jobs being that 15Â½ per cent of them are held by Indigenous Australiansâ€”we are seeing the advantage of the resource industry and the advantage of supporting the resource industry through this FTA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the Labor Party has trouble when it comes to the coal industry. They do not know whether they support the jobs in it or not. We have seen the Labor Party in the Newcastle City Council vote against coal jobs, and we cannot hear a word from the Leader of the Opposition. Does he support coal jobs or not? Or is he so concerned about the Greens preferences that he is ignoring the workers in the coal industry? We need to see this free trade agreement initiated and put in place immediately to make sure that we are supporting the jobs of Australians working in the coal industry.</span>

Day. The question that the member for Throsby asks me concerns a very serious issue, and that is the scourge of and the addiction to ice and methamphetamines particularly in rural communities and certainly across Australia. It is not correct that this government has cut the funds that the member for Throsby refers to. It is not correct that particular programs have been cut, as the member for Throsby refers to.</span>

There will not be any one-size-fits-all approach from Canberra here.

                  </a>  The member for Ballarat could, of course, have asked me a question. The Prime Minister and first ministers, in meeting and talking about this issue, have more statements to make and have a positive and concerted response to effect, because it is not just a federal government issue; it involves state governments as well. It involves acute services. It involves primary services. It involves primary care. It involves the interests of every member of this parliament. So I am happy to communicate in a bipartisan way on these important issues, as I always do, but I do not accept the premise of the question. It is completely wrong, and it should never have been raised.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:55</span>):  I thank the member for Tangney for his question and acknowledge his deep commitment to creating jobs for his constituents through free trade. When Australia's economic history is written, there will be a key chapter devoted to the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement and the jobs and growth created by it. With 95 per cent of the exports to China being tariff free over the life of this agreement, a key beneficiary will be services and particularly financial services, which already make up nearly 10 per cent of our economy. With the liberalisation of rules around insurance, banking and funds management, all Australian companies in this regard will benefit.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I am asked: are there any risks to this approach? The biggest risk comes from those opposite and from the Leader of the Opposition, because we have heard this week in the House how, back in 2005, when the Leader of the Opposition was the head of the AWU, three months before negotiations had even begun he was railing against the agreement. And then, four weeks after negotiations had begun, he asked the most ridiculous question: 'What more could we be exporting to China today than we have exported already?' But with the Leader of the Opposition it always gets better. In June 2005 he did an interview, and he said: 'I do wonder if the China free trade agreement is just an excuse for the Prime Minister to help Woodside sell gas into China.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hang on; I thought free trade was all about helping Australian companies to export to foreign markets. And then the penny dropped, because I am not alone in thinking it is a good thing to export gas to China. But who would want more to sell Woodside gas to China? None other than the member for Brand, because the member for Brand was working for Woodside at the time, and the CEO of Woodside wrote to his staff saying 'how important Gary's political and diplomatic skills were in winning the contract to supply China with its first LNG'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Brand did not need to fly this time to China. He did not need to lobby people in China. He had to lobby the person next to him, the Leader of the Opposition. We know that the member for Brand and the member for Corio both support the free trade agreement with China, because on 12 August 2013 they put out a press release as the then Minister for Resources and Energy and the then Minister for Trade. It said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">An agreementâ€”</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">would cement an already strong commercial relationship by removing trade barriers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there you have it. The Leader of the Opposition is at odds with two of his frontbenchers. He should remember that his job as a head of a political party is not to lobby on behalf of the unions but to lobby on behalf of the people of Australia, and that means putting the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement into law.</span>

                  </a>  So he tells me! As this House well knows, before we came to office the World Heritage Committee took the Great Barrier Reef from the primary list and placed it on the watch list with regard to properties of universal value. It was, in fact, facing being downgraded further to the 'in danger' list, the lowest level of the World Heritage system. As a consequence, we banned the disposalâ€”forever, through lawâ€”of dredge material into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. We created the long-term Reef 2050 sustainability plan. We allocated an additional $140 million as part of the Reef Trust and as part of a broader $2 billion plan for the Great Barrier Reef. As a consequence of those actions, when the World Heritage Committee met in Bonn only a couple of months ago, not only did they decide not to list the reef as an 'in danger' property, not only did they take it off the watch list and not only did they unanimously return it to the highest level, but it was declared by the chair of the World Heritage Committee that Australia was a global role model. That means that more people will want to see this reef. That is where the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement comes in. We have already seen an increase of 18 per cent in Chinese visitor numbers to the Great Barrier Reef.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />One of the interesting things, which was a direct consequence, was the aviation agreement which came from the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. We will see a tripling in the number of passengers to Australia as a consequence of that agreement. We will see an increase in the number of Chinese visitors to the reef as a consequence of that agreement. That means that there will be more jobs in tourism, more revenue within the reef area and more investment available for environmental services in the reef. Beyond that, we have also seen, through the work of the trade minister, an extension of opportunities for Australian environmental exports to China and for Australian environmental services, in areas such as air and water quality, in China. So what we have done is deliver a safer and healthier reef, more opportunities for jobs within the reef area and the opportunity for improved environmental services to China. They are opposed to more jobsâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We are spending and we have committed to well over $50 billion worth of major new infrastructure projects, including significant funding in Western Australia. There are big projects in all of our capital cities, including Perth. There are significant projects right across regional Australia, including in Western Australia. Those projects will make a real difference to the capacity of our economy to grow and take advantage of the opportunities in, for instance, the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. We will need superior infrastructure if our industry is going to prosper and deliver on the potential of that agreement. By placing such a significant amount of money on the table, we have identified a large number of projects for which we have been prepared to make financial commitments. Any project over $100 millionâ€”where there is over $100 million of Australian government commitmentâ€”will have to be assessed by Infrastructure Australia. That is a part of the process. The planning for projects and the arrangements before Infrastructure Australia can proceed simultaneously. The work is advancing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Minister for Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  I am delighted to take a question from the member for Longman about the important issues around health and services generally in the free-trade agreement. I want to congratulate the Minister for Trade on his outstanding effort at negotiating this outstanding agreement. Nine visits to China in 12 months, compare that with previous Labor ministers criss-crossing the globe but not achieving anything at all. This agreement absolutely will mean more jobs for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is a bit of an economics lesson for the opposition because they laugh when we talk about exporters. Australia's prosperity depends on our terms of trade, which is the relationship between our exports and our imports. The more exports we have, the higher our terms of trade and the better our standard of living and, most importantly, the more jobs we have for Australians because that is what this agreement is about; it is about jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly enough, people often think of these jobs in primary production, in agriculture. In fact the Minister for Agriculture may like to know I was at the bar of the Royal Hotel in Wentworth talking about this agreement and a goat producer in the Far West said to me, '40c a kilo on goat meat starting next month because of this free-trade agreement'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Health and the opportunities we have in health in this agreement are enormous and in fact unlimited because what the Chinese have done is give us access to build health, education and aged care facilities in China in an unprecedented way. I would have thought that the Labor Party, with so many union members in the health sector, would have been interested in the opportunities for health under this agreement. But in fact they are not interested at all. We have done in one year what they had not done in six.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is now clear why these negotiations have stalled. Remember, this was an agreement that was started under the Howard government, stalled under Labor, finished under the Abbott government. We have done in one year what they could not do in six. We know why the negotiations have stalled; they have stalled because Labor is too frightened, too scared, too lacking in courage to negotiate an agreement that does good things for Australian jobs and Australia's future. They are not interested in prosperity. They are not interested in investment. They are not interested in future growth. The Leader of the Opposition has in fact trashed those future job opportunities for the young people in rural Australia because of the relationship that this opposition has with its union puppet mastersâ€”no courage, no imagination and the Australian people will have no interest in their policy.</span>

I am pleased that I did check with the Attorney-General. It is a lesson for all of us to always check the allegations that they make. I said how Labor had left us with the debt and deficit legacy but Labor also left us with the funding cliff. It seems they only funded community legal centres for a short period and Labor did not make any arrangements for this to continue or to provide any certainty.</span>

                  </a>  So in terms of the Peel legal centre that the shadow Attorney-General raised with me, they are already scheduled to receive $276,278 in legal funding over the next two years. It is already being amassed. In March this year, we announced over $25 million to help legal assistance services. This included: $12 million over two years for 61 community centres; $11.5 million over two years for the Indigenous Legal Assistance Program;â€”</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:13</span>):  The Abbott government's budget cuts have had a particularly harsh impact on community services across Australia. Vulnerable people including those trying to get treatment to free themselves of the ice addiction and women and children fleeing domestic violence are the ones who are going to suffer as a result. The government has made plenty of promises about combatting ice addiction but it has been wanting when it comes to action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It takes a special kind of incompetence to spend $20 million three days before budget night telling the people of Australia that we have got a problem and then three days later ripping $800 million from the solutions to that problem. This is exactly what this government have done. They spent $20 million on an advertising campaign telling Australians that we had a problem with ice addiction and then, not three days later, the Treasurer stood at that dispatch box and ripped $800 million from the funds which provide the solution to ice addiction and other drug and alcohol addiction in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few moments ago, the Minister for Health, in answer to a question that I put to her about the cuts to services which are providing relief to people with drug and alcohol addictions, denied there had been any cuts to those services at all. She stood at that dispatch box and lectured me for having the temerity to ask her a question about the cuts that they are imposing upon alcohol and drug services throughout the country, particularly those in the electorate of Canningâ€”and in Western Australia we have one of the highest levels of amphetamine addiction in the country. She said that we were misleading the parliament. She said that it was not true. In the time that she made that denial and misled the parliament, I had made available to me and the House a copy of the transcript from the Community Affairs Legislation Committee of 1 June 2015, where Dr Bartlett, of the minister's department, was asked directly about cuts to the Substance Misuse Prevention and Service Improvement Grants. In answer to a question from Senator Di Natale, Dr Bartlett had this to say: 'We have cut $7 million.' So, when the minister comes back into the House, we will be expecting that she apologises to the House, to the people of Western Australia and to the people of Canning for lying to the House, for misleading the House about the cuts that they have made to substance misuse programs, including those programs which are providing relief to people who are addicted to the terrible drug ice or methamphetamine in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last two budgets, the government has quietly ripped a total of almost $800 million from the health flexible funds, which include substance misuse funds supporting illicit drug treatment and rehabilitation as well as prevention strategies. We still do not knowâ€”and the minister had the opportunity to clarify this during question time today but she refused toâ€”exactly how much money is going to be ripped from those funds, which are providing money to drug and alcohol rehabilitation services throughout the country. It could be from all of them; it could be from any of them. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you contrast the position that has been taken by Bill Shorten's Labor opposition to providing security and certainty and funding to those critical services with the position taken by the government, the contrast could not be greater. Only Labor understands the importance of supporting workers and the services that they provide in front-line treatment. That is why last week, in the electorate of Canning, Bill Shorten announced that a Labor government would provide $2.7 million in funding for drug treatment services to the Palmerston Association Inc. and Hope Community Services in Canning. This would guarantee funding to those services through to 2019. In addition to that, the Leader of the Opposition promised that we would also support women and children escaping domestic violence to get the legal support that they need, by investing $270,000 for the Peel Community Legal Services. The government had an opportunity to match that promise. The government was given a specific opportunity to match that promise. Indeed, the Labor spokesperson stood up and asked the Labor candidate for the seat of Canning, 'Will you match Labor's commitment to provide $2.7 million worth of funding certainty to the drug and alcohol treatment services in the electorate that you want the people to vote for you in?' He refused to give that guarantee. When asked what he was going to do, do you know what he promised? He promised a talkfest. We have got a National Ice Taskforce. It seems to be that their answer to everything is a task force. When asked to match the funding, all the person who wants to be the next member for Canning could guarantee was that he would convene a workshop and there would be a Canning-specific ice task force. There you have it. The contrast could not be starker. We had on the one hand the Labor candidate promising to secure funding of over $2.7 million to those much-needed services, and we had the Liberal candidate squibbing the issue, offering nothing more than a talkfest. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the opening, the government have promised a lot but delivered very little. They ran a $20 million television advertising campaign telling the people of Australia something that they already knew, and that is that there is a problem with ice in our communities. But then, three days later, they ripped the money out of the services that were providing an answer to that problem. Their priorities are all wrong. They had the opportunity, and indeed the minister had the opportunity, to provide some certainty for the services right around the country in terms of their funding, but she could not do that. Instead of guaranteeing funding for the full three years over the forward estimates, all that she could do was confirm that there would be one year's guaranteed funding and no more. You would think that, if we have got a problem of the magnitude that the government tell us we have got when it comes to amphetamines and methamphetamines and ice addiction in this country, they would be guaranteeing more than one year's funding to the services that are providing an answer to that problem. But that is all the minister could do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, it is not just those services, because we know that we have a significant problem with residential rehab services and detoxification services and waiting lists right around the country. A few months ago, we saw the member for Dobell give a speech in her electorate where she made the outrageous claim that she knew firsthand of a situation where somebody had walked into a public hospital after gouging their eyeballs out and eating them with a spoon, in an ice-induced rage. We know of course that the story was not true, but the member for Dobell, in her defence, said that this was evidence of the concern that both she and members of her constituency had about the scourge of ice on the New South Wales Central Coast. We contacted the Kamira Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Services in Wyong on the New South Wales Central Coast, and we heard of the problems that they are facing. They have waiting lists in excess of three months. This is a service which provides specialist treatment for women in particular. If these people do not get treatment inside a one-month period, they face having their children removed from them. They have over 30 people calling this service every day seeking access to a residential rehab service, and they have to turn them away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope the member for Dobell is raising this issue with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health, who could do nothing more than deny the truth that they are cutting funds from these services. I hope each and every one of those members opposite who have been running those forums in their electorates, whipping their constituencies up about the concern they have with ice and the fact that they have a national task force will ask themselves what they are going to do about the solutions to the problem. We know that they are cutting $7.2 million from the funds. We know that in Dobell, in Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory and in Canning and in services right around the country they do not have the resources today. The problem is getting worse and all this government can do is cut funds from the services which are the answer to the problem. Their priorities are all wrong: $20 million to tell Australia we have a problem; $800 million from the solution to the problem. The people of Canning and the people of Australia deserve much better.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M2Y" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TUDGE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:23</span>):  A few days ago a young three-year-old boy, Aylan Kurdi, became the face of a refugee crisis in the Middle East. That one image has been used to mobilise resources around the world towards supporting the refugee crisis unfolding there and this government has stepped up to help ameliorate that crisis. This morning on the front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph</span> perhaps we were shown the face of a boy who will become the face of the ice crisis in Australia, Brayden Rhodesâ€”tragically, a seven-year-old boy who was killed by his uncle yesterday in Sydney who was believed to be on ice. Certainly, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph's</span> front page suggests that this boy is now the face of the ice crisis and perhaps will ensure that the broader community is made more aware of this dreadful crisis and what is being done, what more will be done and how we all need to work together as community to try to address it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are tragic situations like what happened to Brayden Rhodes occurring all the time now. Sadly, the number of users of this insidious drug ice has doubled in the last two years. Those using ice are doing it more frequently, with the number of people using it at least monthly also doubling in the last few years. It is one of the most addictive and dangerous drugs that we have seen come to the Australian marketplace. Unfortunately, it is widespread. I am informed it is readily available and in many cases, as we saw in the newspapers this morning, it is deadly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that today ice causes more deaths on our roads than alcohol, at least in Victoria and no doubt in other states. We also know that nearly 60 per cent of all organised crime figures are involved in its production. So we must do everything that we can to get on top of this insidious drug, and this government is taking the lead to do that. Yes, we have set up a National Ice Taskforce and we asked a very prominent member of our community, former Victorian Chief Police Commissioner Lay, to head up that task force, a very highly regarded individual. He has already begun his work and soon we will be getting his final report. But many steps have already been taken, and I will come to that but, before doing that, let me first address the allegations made by the member for Throsby.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To this point, the ice scourge has been dealt with in a quite bipartisan way in this parliament. We have tried to work cooperatively with the opposition. I think the work that has occurred across the parliament in committees between individuals has been outstanding. We all need to work together on this problem. Indeed, we are working cooperatively with state governments, be they coalition or Labor state governments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am disappointed that the member for Throsby has tried to politicise this issue today. He is politicising it because of the Canning by-election that is coming up and he is politicising it on the basis of a falsehood. The falsehood he was alluding to today is that we have cut funding to drug and alcohol services. In fact, as the Minister for Health outlined in question time today directly to the question put to her by the member for Throsby, no such cuts to drug and alcohol services have been made. I would have thought that the member for Throsby would have had the decency in this matter of public importance debate to change some of his rhetoric. He got the answer from the Minister for Health that no cuts had been made, but he has continued with his false rhetoric and tried to split the bipartisan approach to this national scourge. I think it is outrageous. I used to think the member for Throsby was better than that, one of the more impressive members of the team opposite. But I am very disappointed with him. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me outline to the members opposite and to this parliament some of the actions that this government is taking in relation to ice, and perhaps some of my own reflections on what more could be done as a community. The first thing that we should point out is the action being taken jointly by the state and federal governments to try to crack down on the supply and production of ice. At the end of the day, if there is no supply there is no ice problem. You can only have addictions and problems if there is a supply. So we have put an additional $18 million towards the Australian Crime Commission to help crack down on the ice networks, as organised crime particularly seem to be the distributors and manufacturers of this dreadful drug. That is the first thing, and that is on top of a number of other activities which are occurring in law enforcement agencies at the state level, in particular through the National Anti-Gangs Squad, which is now operating in four statesâ€”Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing we are seeing occurring now across Australia is additional support and hotlines for parents who, from the feedback I have received, are so desperately in need of advice on how to deal with this, particularly if they have a child who may be using the drug. I must admit I commend the Andrews government in Victoria for introducing the Ice Help Line, which parents can call to get confidential advice on how to deal with a particular matter. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have put more money into drug and alcohol services. This year alone something like $218 million for drug and alcohol treatment is going towards detox and rehabilitation services and the like. Is more going to be needed if this ice epidemic continues? Undoubtedly. Of course, state governments have primary responsibility in that area, but I believe that more detox and rehabilitation services may be required in the future if this deadly drug continues and the scourge continues at the rate it is. In relation to our rehabilitation services, I think we should be looking at some of the overseas models in terms of how they have done it. In particular, there are lessons to be learnt from Sweden and we should be examining that to also inform some of our policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finallyâ€”and again we have started this initiativeâ€”we need to change the culture in our community in relation to illicit drugs and in particular in relation to ice. We need to get the message out there to young people, and indeed across the community, that ice is a deadly drug and that illicit drugs, illegal drugs, should never be taken, ever, and that it is not safe to take illegal drugs. That message needs to be made clear. In some respects, I find it odd that in our community we tell people very bluntly and very graphically that every cigarette kills. And that is true: every cigarette will cause you damage and ultimately smoking will kill. I think we need to have the same level of graphic message in relation to illicit drugsâ€”that every drug is dangerous and that in some cases taking a drug only once or twice, particularly ice, can make you addicted. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at the statistics as to why individuals take up drugs in the first instance, it is quite informative. You will often hear that people take up drugs in the first instance because of depression, because they are feeling down or because they want a pick-me-up. When you look at the data, the National Drug Strategy Household Survey shows that only seven per cent of people said they took drugs in the first instance because they thought it would improve their mood or would stop them feeling unhappy. Over half of the respondents, 51.4 per cent of people, said they took drugs for the first time because friends or family encouraged them to do soâ€”that is, it was culturally accepted to take drugs in the first instance. To me, that suggests that we can work on this and that we can continue with these graphic ads on TV and continue with this very strong message that drugs should never be taken, particularly ice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we have a very good national task force in place. We have already begun the efforts, but more effort is absolutely going to be required. This government is leading from the front, in cooperation with state governments, but, sadly, no longer with the support of the Labor Party. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0O" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FEENEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Batman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:33</span>):  This week Australia marked a significant anniversary. This of course was the week where the Abbott government turned two. It has, indeed, been a very harrowing two years for the Australian people. Alas, '2' seems to be the appropriate number for this government to have achieved because they behave like two-year-olds. Australia still waits for the adults we were promised. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014, the Abbott government gave us the budget it wanted to give to this countryâ€”a budget of cuts and a budget that imagined a little Australia. We all know how that story turned out. So, in 2015, it then tried to give us the budget it thought Australia wanted. But, again, there is a theme running between these two budgets. The first is that this is a government that actually has no sense of its own purpose. It has come to government without a sense of what its task is. In 2014, the government told the people of Australia that it was here to deal with a budget emergency. By 2015 the budget emergency had vanished and instead we had a government that was in the business of doubling the deficit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015, however, we saw another theme emerge, notwithstanding the confusion of the other side, and that is that there were a number of malevolent cuts in the 2014 budget that endured and survived into 2015. Again and again, we have seen very important causes and very important undertakings, front-line services to the Australian people, cut by this government. Alas, when considering ice and the scourge of ice, this is not an exception. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In last year's budget, we saw some $197 million cut from the Health flexible funds. That immediately meant $7 million being axed from the Substance Misuse Prevention and Service Improvement Grants Fundâ€”a very real and tangible slashing of service. What we have also seen in this year's budget is an additional $596 million taken from those flexible funds. So, again and again, we have seen critical services in health prevention cut and slashed by this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one area where the government seem keen to demonstrate their bona fides and that is in the pretence of actionâ€”the appearance of action in the absence of real action. That means television commercials and that means a government stepping up to the by-election in Canning and desperately searching for something to talk about, because we know the government cannot talk to the people of Canning about the economy. The Treasurer lost the power and the capacity to do that a very long time ago. Their message of low growth and no jobs is clearly not resonating in the community. So the economy was off the list. That left them, in their view, with a law and order campaign around ice. So we have a television campaign and we have a government fumbling through the Canning by-election advertising the pretence of action </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In its by-election blues, in its pretence of action, it has talked about forming a National Ice Taskforce, because those opposite understand something very well indeed, and that is that committees are the practical alternative to work. So we have a task force, and we have a television campaign. What we do not have is a government stepping up to the challenge of building evidence-based policies that take this challenge on in a real and meaningful way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from the previous speaker, the member for Aston, about the real bona fides of the government in this debate, because when the rubber hits the road he said, 'Of course, this is an area that is principally a state responsibility, and states have the primary responsibility'â€”not the primary responsibility for television commercials and not the primary responsibility for announcing task forces but the primary responsibility for building evidence-based policies and funding them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is a government fighting a mirage. It is in the Canning by-election searching for a reason to exist. It cannot talk about the economy and it cannot talk about meaningful action in terms of the ice epidemic, but it can talk about the appearance of action. Again and again, the theme that unites the chaos of 2014 and the anarchy of the government's present position is cuts, but there is also another theme, and that is an adherence to clinging to Labor ideas. Among the tiny number of achievements this government does seek to point to, it points to the collaboration between state and federal police forces and the MOUs and resources that have made those police forces' work more effectiveâ€”a fine Labor initiative. Of course it enjoys bipartisan support. It was our idea.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:38</span>):  On a day when a former Labor president comes out and publicly lashes the Labor Party about their opposition to free trade, on a day when they try to politicise the strong and generous response to the Syrian refugee crisis, Labor have again picked up the scattergun with this MPI, politicising the issue of ice addiction and community services in order to gain political advantage for the by-election of Canning. Labor want to talk about community service credentials, which they define exclusively by the amount of money they spend and the amount of legislation they put through the parliament. Call me hard-headed, but when someone tries to convince me of their credentials I have a bit of a look at their track record. So let's look at some examples. It turns out that Labor, when in government, handed out $72,000 in a grant to the Auburn Community Development Network. I thought that sounded like an interesting network. It sounds like a nice thing to do. But it turns out that this was handed over in order to hostâ€”get thisâ€”an 'enviro tea salon'. Thanks to the funding, participants could take part in: 'a weaving workshop using native lomandra grass. Participants will be encouraged to share their energy efficiency tips in exchange for a free seedling, re-potted into a recycled coffee cup sourced from a local business.' There's community services! There's high-impact community services for you!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we see many more of these. There was their numeracy natural partnership, which produced no improvement in student outcomes despite $540 million in payments. If you measure it by spending, it was terrific. If you measure it by outcomes, it was completely lacklustre. The Department of Parliamentary Services spent about $2.4 million on staff-related training, includingâ€”get thisâ€”getting a good night's sleep. We might define that as an important community service, but I think there are better ways to spend the money. And the list goes on. In fact, many of their community services, it turns out, were unfunded beyond their time in government. In fact, we heard about that just a few minutes ago with their community legal services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, unapologetically, we had to clean some of this stuff out and to focus our efforts on community services that delivered outcomes and were genuinely innovative. An outcome focus is exactly what we have been doing since we got into government. If you look at our employment services providers, jobactive, they are focused on delivering outcomes. In fact, we are doing something very innovative, which is actually paying employment service providers for delivering outcomes. Our Transition to Work Program, which is designedâ€”get this; it is revolutionaryâ€” to get young people into jobs, is looking at a series of innovative pilots that actually have a track record in delivering genuine youth employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, of course, we are working hard on innovative, outcome-focused programs for treating ice, like hotlines for parents, which we heard about earlier, and over $200 million for drug and alcohol services and education campaigns. To hear those opposite say that those advertisements were a waste of money is a slap in the face to every family member of an ice addict, because they know how important awareness and education are to solving this problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's strong track record for community services is illustrated no better than in my electorate of Hume, where we have a new mental health headspace opening in Goulburn in 2016. Here the community cried out loudly for that community service, and they will be getting it. There is $500,000 for a childcare centre at Boorowa, a community of just over 1,000 people struggling to get residents back into the workforce, particularly female residents. And the list goes on. We spend $227 million each yearâ€”or we willâ€”in social services. That money should be spent well. We will always spend it well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:43</span>):  I was wondering, as I was sitting here during question time, what parallel universe we actually live in here, especially when the foreign minister, the member for Curtin, got up and berated us after she had received a piece of paper from the Attorney-General's office telling us how much they had spent on legal services across the country. But, of course, what she said belies the truth. Can I just enlighten the chamberâ€”and you particularly, Mr Deputy Speakerâ€”on some comments made today by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory about 'people in custody who are waiting' and 'witnesses whose memories are fading' because a legal aid agency does not have enough money for lawyers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency, or NAAJA, has proposed to vacate seven trials in which it was to defend people in the Northern Territory Supreme Court today because it did not have enough federal funding to handle its caseload. NAAJA principal lawyer Jonathon Hunyor told the court:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our resources aren't keeping up with the demands â€¦ we don't have staff to meet our commitments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Hunyor said NAAJA no longer had access to the Expensive Indigenous Case Fund, which allowed it to outsource help for cases that would cost more than $20,000. Very serious alleged crimes such as murder and sexual assault are the most expensive. Chief Justice Trevor Riley said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm concerned about underlying insufficient funding for lawyers on the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not us speaking, foreign minister. This is not us speaking, justice minister and Attorney-General. It is the Chief Justice of the Northern Territory Supreme Court. Following the 2015-16 budget, where the federal government funding was found to be insufficient to keep up with the exploding case load, Chief Justice Riley described the funding situation as 'a blow to the heart of the Northern Territory justice system'. Call me naive, but you would reckon he might know. You would think the foreign minister might actually think before she opens her big fat trap and says stupid things in this parliament.</span>

Sadly, he knows very little about this subject, which he is supposed to be representing the government on, and he does not defend the interests of those people whose interests he says he is looking after in the executive of this government. He does not look after their interests. I have just spoken about one community legal service. In its two years in power, the Abbott government has taken an axe to vital legal assistance services across this country. It has been evidenced today by the comments in the Northern Territory Supreme Court. The government has cut from every type of service. It has cut from legal aid, from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services, from family violence prevention legal services and from community legal centres. And these cuts are continuing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2014 budget, the government took another $15 million from legal aid and another $6 million from community legal services. Earlier this year, the government tried to back away from some of their cuts to the CLCs. They cannot be believed. When the member for Curtin got up here this afternoon and so glibly spoke about what the government says it has been doing, she was actually telling us a giant fibâ€”because we know and it is the experience on the ground that the savage cuts they have made are hurting people across this country.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  Before I talk on an MPI, I am always very curious to have a look at it and try to understand why the Labor Party might be putting it forward. When I looked at this MPI and saw that the member for Throsby was putting it forward, I thought, 'This seems to lack substance. It seems to be all about style.' Member for Throsby, I do not do this very often but I will give you a tiny bit of advice. I think you need a little less of that professional coaching that you have had. You walk to the dispatch box and stand there, You put one hand here and the other hand goes into your pocket. You look around and think to yourself, 'Okay, I'll get a bit of hand movement going here with this hand here.' We are all watching; we see it every single time. You walk to the dispatch box, you put one hand here and you put the other hand in your pocket and you make yourself look very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Member for Throsby, let's have a little less concentration on the style and a bit more concentration on the substance. If you focused on the substance, you would know we have not cut drug and alcohol funding. Go away and do some research. Forget about your little style tips; do the research and focus on the substance. There have been no cuts to drug and alcohol funding whatsoever. As a matter of fact, what has been taking place in this space is bipartisan cooperation. There was bipartisan cooperation until you started this shameful debate which seeks to break this bipartisanship on this subject. We in this place should all be above that. This is not about political opportunism. This is about a scourge which is impacting on communities right across Australia. Rather than running dirty little smear campaigns such as we see with this MPI, you should all be seeking to work with the government to make sure that we can combat this scourge </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at what the government has done. We are running a TV campaign and everyone who has seen those ads knows that they are working and that they are having a real impact on the community. If you see those ads, you cannot help but be confronted by the images in them. They portray what is happening out there in communities, in hospitals and in emergency waiting rooms. They portray the kinds of actions that are occurring when these people are inflicted by this insidious drug. We have also set up a hotline for parents, which enables parents who are dealing with these types of issues for the first time and encountering stuff that no parent would ever, ever want to face to seek advice. We are establishing a national ice task force with the states. We are working with the state governments cooperatively. We are putting substance into the methods to deal with this crisis which is gripping our community, and all we get from the other side is a pathetic MPI like this.</span>

The matter of public importance today raises the real question that I have been asking myself across the last two days, and that is: What does this government have against anything with 'community' in its title? Everything that relates to community seems to have been slashed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Batman rightly pointed out in his contribution that what we are dealing with today in talking about the cuts to community services across different sectors are the remnants of the cruel 2014 budget that those opposite realised, probably too late, was not translating with the Australian people. The Australian people had cottoned on, and some of that was because groups like community legal centres ran a campaign when they saw the savage cuts to their programs, when they saw the dollar figures in that first budget. So they got busy and they ran a community campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want a lesson in a community awareness campaign, you might want to talk to the community legal centres, because they ran such a good campaign that those opposite decided, 'Oops; we had better put some of this money back.' But they put the money back after community legal centres had already lost staff. I had a roundtable in the electorate of Lalor with the community organisations that work so hard on the ground in my communityâ€”organisations that work with refugee resettlement programs, our community legal centre and people who work with the most vulnerable on their worst days to provide them with relief and provide them with financial counselling. At that roundtable, in an hour and a half, each of those organisations relayed to me how dramatic the cuts were and the impact they were going to have on the services they could provide to the most vulnerable in my community. It was an eye-opener.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had been through the 2014 budget with a fine toothcomb and then we had some announcements that said that money was going back. But when I sat with those community organisations they were not grateful or happy, because the funding that was put back was not put back for a long enough period of time to ensure that they could continue those services. They highlighted for me something that most of us who have been in any kind of management position will understand, and that is that retaining experienced staff is one of the toughest things to do in any business and any organisation, They highlighted for me very, very clearly that staff retention was their primary concern and that this government's 'chop, put back, chop, put back' had impacted directly on their ability to retain their experienced staff. It is still impacting now, and it will impact again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is not a business in the world that works in six-month cycles. Nobody puts their hand up to say, 'I'll take that temporary job for six months,' when there is a job around the corner with a three-year contract. We can talk about dollars but what we should talk about are the impacts. Community organisations in my electorate do not have the staff on the ground that they had two years ago when this government came to power. They do not have the same level of resourcing and they do not have the staff. It is an absolute disgrace. That leads me to ask again: What does this government have against communities? Communities have been hit and hit and hit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are hearing today is absolute denial. I was a school teacher for a long time, and I understand the principle of, 'If you are caught, deny, deny, deny.' I am very practised in unpacking the deny, deny, deny principle. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  It is a pleasure to talk about community and community services. Community is a matter of public importance. If there is one thing that I know and understand about the electorate that I represent it is that we are made up of communities. It always amuses me that, in a lot of ways, the Greens represent the richest electorate in Australia. Then probably comes the Liberal Party, representing some of richer onesâ€”some of the country Libs not soâ€”and then comes the Labor Party. But, as the National Party and country MPs would know, we represent some of the poorest in our society. So we have a very strong interest on this side in delivering community services but we also understand that the people who live in our communities want a hand up, not a hand out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I think about the communities I represent, we have great organisations such as Sunassist where people voluntarily drive cars and pick up people who are unable to get the groceries, go to the doctor and to health appointments. We have great organisations like the Christian Emergency Food Centre. I was in there the other day and the federal government gave this organisation $50,000. Just think about this for a momentâ€”you want to talk about communities; you want to listen for a moment. We have listened to you for a while, but listen to this: $50,000 is all they get. They have 70 volunteers and they get foodâ€”sometimes schools donate food, package it and send it in. They have people come inâ€”people who might be victims of domestic violence, people who might be drought affected farmers. There was a lady out the back who was packing food parcels. She was 89 years oldâ€”now that is about community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people in my community are saying: 'We want the opportunity to grow the net worth of our town. We want jobs for younger Australians. We want a free trade agreement, frankly, so we can open the markets up.' Those things create wealth in the poorest communities in Australia and, when you have got wealth in those communities, you empower them to have the time and the dollars to commit to building their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Communities are built from the grassroots up; they are not built from the federal government throwing money at them. That is what our side of parliament understands. If we can create the framework for those communities to prosper, they will prosper. They will do it for themselves, as opposed to the other side of the parliament who simply wanted to shut down those rural communities. You talk about six months forward estimates: try running a cattle business and then shutting the whole trade in 24 hours. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You have got to build the framework. That is exactly what we have been doing: we have been building the telecommunications framework; we have been building the road framework; and we have been creating trade opportunities. This is all about building up communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I think about the dollars that we have committedâ€”federal dollars that have gone into my communityâ€”it has been substantial. So not only have we created the framework but we have also ensured that we have picked up from the bottom. There is a very high Indigenous population in the electorate of Mallee. I can put my finger on direct funding of over $20 million. I can put my finger onâ€”and this is a lesson on communityâ€”an oncology wing. Here we had a community that had the worst five-year survival rates for cancer. They are in the process of raising a million dollars of their own. The federal government has then come along and given them another million dollars. The only million dollars that is still to come to the table is from the Victorian Labor Party. They have not committed it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to talk about communities and look at how you can lift standards of living, I would encourageâ€”and I see a Labor Party member from Victoria thereâ€”you to talk to your state colleagues and say: 'The community has raised a million dollars. The federal government has raised a million dollars.' It is time that you talked to your Labor counterparts in Victoria to chip in their one-third. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are building communities. Not only are we building communities; we are building opportunities and growing economies. We all know that, if we have a strong and robust economy, it becomes the engine room so we have jobs and wealth. And, out of those jobs and wealth, we create an energy in those communities that brings prosperity. That is what we are doing. That is what our side of parliament fully understands and that is what we are going to deliver to the Australian people. </span>

It actually gave me some understanding of the approach the Abbott government is taking to community services. The approach is: let them do it by themselvesâ€”no role for the federal government whatsoever.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It really has given me some understanding that I was lacking beforehand, because I was wondering: why is it that the Abbott government has cut all the funding to community services? Why is it that the Abbott government is not funding community health programs and programs that help people who are addicted to ice? Why is it that the Abbott government walks away from supporting families? Why is that the Abbott government walks away from supporting anyone who looks to government for support? It is because those on the other side of this parliament believe: they can do it themselves. </span>

                  </a>  Yes, I know. The member for Charlton reminded me it was the member for Dobell who told of a horrific story of a person gouging their eye out at John Hunter Hospital in the electorate of the member for Charlton. But then, when the veracity of this statement was checked, I think you will be absolutely devastated to hear that there were no medical records of this occurrence. I just do not understand. The best way to address ice addiction is not just to hold community forums, not to place advertisements in the local papers, not to promote the members opposite but rather to ensure that those services are funded on the groundâ€”services that people need to actually fight their ice addiction. I think this government stands condemned because it is all about promotion, noise, fluff and bubbles rather than action and addressing the real issue. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  I am not quite sure where to start after that contribution from the member for Shortland. I do not think we understood much of anything she was saying other than what we know about those opposite is that they will often say whatever they can no matter what the truth of the matter is. We have just seen a fine example of that from the member for Shortland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to start off my contribution by addressing a comment made by the member for Lingiari in this debate. This is an important debate about community services, but I have to say that what the member for Lingiari did in the comment that he made about the foreign minister was an absolute disgrace. He said to 'shut her big, fat trap'. That is the most disgusting, misogynistic, sexist comment that I have heard in this chamber for a very long time. It is a very serious matter. It is an appalling thing to say to any woman in this chamber, and I would call on the member for Lingiari to write a personal letter of apology for what he has said about our foreign minister. I look at the member for Jagajaga, and you would be equally disgusted. It is a terrible thing that was said about any woman in this House. I have to say it is a disgrace, and I call on the member for Lingiari to do the right thing for all women in this chamber and write a personal letter of apology.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many ways in which we are contributing to the community. In my electorate alone millions and millions of dollars are flowing into my community in a whole range of different ways: disability, health, family violence and community legal services. We have not heard anything from those opposite about our Stronger Communities fund. This is an initiative of our government where we will be providing $150,000 in every electorate to support community organisations to build stronger communities. It is really unfortunate when there has been a fair degree of bipartisanship on this particular initiative that we have not even heard it mentioned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Disability Insurance Scheme is one of the most significant contributions to our community in a generation, and what have we heard from members opposite? Absolutely nothing. We are so proud to be hosting the National Disability Insurance Agency headquarters in Geelong. More than 3,300 people have already reaped the benefits in the Barwon trial. Let me remind members opposite that, when we came into government, we inherited an efficiency dividendâ€”a cutâ€”to NDIS support packages that the member for Jagajaga would know all about. It was a cut of $44.9 million, and we reversed it. That is one of the many ways in which we are reversing the damage caused by members opposite when they were in government. The NDIS is a once-in-a-generation transformation for people with a disability, and we are proudly leading the way in rolling out the NDIS right across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to refer briefly to the terrible scourge of ice. There is again a lot of bipartisanship in relation to this issue. Ten or so days ago I visited Foundation 61 and met with Rob Lytzki. He provides long-term rehabilitation and does an incredible job with this organisation. A hundred people are on his waiting list. People are dying on his waiting list. These ice summits have been made a joke of by members opposite, but they are reaping a lot of results as we feed that into the National Ice Taskforce. I have supported the call for more funding for long-term rehabilitation beds, and we see here that the state Minister for Mental Health, Martin Foley, has not. That is very unfortunate because, as we know, ice is not a nine-to-five problem. We need to keep the bipartisanship on these issues, and what we are seeing opposite is very unfortunate. Rather than play politics, let's join together to fight this dreaded scourge.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARKUS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  I rise to speak on the coalition's Omnibus Repeal Day (Autumn 2015) Bill 2015. The coalition government has committed itself to cutting $1 billion of red tape each year. In March this year we announced there would be a further $300 million worth of new decisions to reduce red tape this coming annual repeal day. This government's decision will cut $2.45 billion worth of red tape from the Australian economy. The repeal day bill is more than grammar and punctuation as claimed by the Manager of Opposition Business. It should be remembered that, in the last year of the former Labor government, Commonwealth regulations were costing Australians approximately $64 billion per yearâ€”a remarkable 4.2 per cent of GDP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite Labor's debt and deficit disaster and challenging repair bill, this government recognises there are unnecessary restrictions on businesses, community groups, families and individuals that we can lift and repeal. In doing so, we will take away the pressure of completing unnecessary paperwork, standing in queues and searching for information. This will give time back to people, enabling them to focus on more important matters and saving money on compliance costs. This government recognises that small business is indeed the engine room and the backbone of the Australian economy. Excessive and costly regulation hinders business growth, investment and job creation. This government cares about small business and job creation, as where there are jobs there are opportunities. We understand that red tape and the unnecessary compliance burden clogs up the ability of the hard-working women and men of small business to get their jobs done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For small businesses, this means that 45,000 businesses that have no GST reporting requirements will no longer have to lodge a Business Activity Statement where, to date, lodgements have been made only to report PAYG instalments. And 402,000 small businesses with modest or negative incomes that are required to lodge a business activity statement will no longer have to interact with the PAYG instalment system. This means businesses can spend more time ensuring they are successful instead of spending time reporting on unnecessary and time consuming compliance. These changes will reduce their compliance costs by $63.7 million per year. In Macquarie the owner of Xtabay, a local unique coffee shop, advised that these measures would save him at least two hours a weekâ€”that is two extra hours to focus on what is important to him rather than on administrative tasks. A successful small business with more time to grow means more job creation and a stronger and more prosperous economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To that end, we will improve the ATO website so that six million Australians can find relevant information more quickly, with an annual compliance savings of $48.5 million. The myTax initiative reduces the amount of information that 1.4 million users will have to supply to the ATO when filling their e-tax forms each year, resulting in a net red tape saving of $156 million. Commonwealth laws and regulations can be a complex area to understand and navigate through. The establishment of a Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman will provide a concierge for the dispute resolution service and contribute to the development of small business-friendly Commonwealth laws and regulations. The establishment of the Fair Work Ombudsman's small business helpline will help business owners with advice on employee wages and workplace laws. This will create more time for business owners to focus on their businesses whilst getting the correct advice to look after their employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 July 2015 a $200 million Australian apprenticeship support network will shift apprenticeship services away from administration to outcome focused services such as mentoring and job matching to better support businesses and apprentices. With the introduction of legislation for paid parental leave, employers will be relieved of the administrative task associated with payments, which will now be made through the Department of Human Services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Implementing additional functionality for myGov users to allow customers to update their details in one place using the myGov Tell Us Once service and to obtain secure and convenient access to online services with a single account and one set of credentials provides annual compliance savings of $5.4 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Students who receive government payments are now able to change their details online, at a time that best suits them, without being required to contact a call centre or attend a service centre. This provides annual compliance savings of $2.7 million. Again for students, for those at school, an online national assessment platform is being developed which will deliver the National Assessment Programâ€”Literacy and Numeracy, or NAPLAN, online. It is scheduled to be available to school staff from 2017, with annual compliance savings of $9.7 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With two Defence facilities in the electorate of Macquarie, and the Centenary of Anzac well underway, Defence personnel and veterans are close to my heart and that of this government. This government is committed to cutting red tape for these commendable men and women. Defence personnel and veterans have worked hard to keep this and other nations safe and secure. It is a stressful time when you find yourself with unfortunate circumstances, making a claim for compensation, and for grieving families following the death of a loved one. There are more pressing matters to deal with at these times than laborious and unnecessary paperwork.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those making claims for compensation, an ADF ID card can now be used as proof of identity, rather than a 100-point document check. This is a simple yet sensible measure. We are also enabling the automatic payment of Department of Veterans' Affairs funeral benefits to the estates of veterans following the receipt of a death notification, rather than requiring the family or executor to complete paper based forms, where eligibility permits. This government understands that there is an easier way, particularly for those families who are grieving.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I announced more than 37 new aged-care places that we delivered across Macquarie. Aged-care providers offer an invaluable service for those who have worked hard to secure our future and on whose shoulders we stand. For aged-care providers we have increased the proposed thresholds above which aged-care accommodation prices must be approved by the Aged Care Pricing Commissioner to $550,000. Additionally, we are simplifying the proposed accommodation-pricing process to remove the requirement for aged-care providers to follow a prescriptive process in setting prices, whilst also ensuring that consumers receive clear information on accommodation prices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will remove certain certification requirements of aged-care facilities, including those that duplicate state building requirements under the Building Code of Australia. And we will repeal provisions in the Aged Care Act 1997 that require approved providers to notify the Department of Social Services of any changes in key personnel in their employment within 28 days of the change occurring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this repeal day, we want to improve outcomes for people with disabilities by assisting those seeking assistance to find work with easier processes and by helping providers spend more time supporting people into the workforce. Among the changes, participants will be able to accept their employment pathway plan on the Australian JobSearch website rather than by using email or post. I would like to take this opportunity to say that this government is committed to people with disabilities on repeal day and beyond, with the Prime Minister and the NSW Premier, Mike Baird, announcing the NDIS rollout in the electorate of Macquarie one year earlier than expected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Agriculture is an important industry in the Hawkesbury, in the electorate of Macquarie. Livestock producers, pet owners and animal feed manufacturers are all set to benefit from reforms announced on repeal day which will see a $7.8 million annual reduction in red tape, with the government committed to making it easier for Australia to do business while also maintaining our high human and animal health standards. Reforms will see low-risk animal feed products excluded from some regulations, which in the long run will benefit consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Blue Mountains, in the electorate of Macquarie, boast some of Australia's major tourist attractions, with tourism contributing as a major employer. In tourism, another major industry in the electorate, we are expanding the list of eligible countries and regions whose citizens can lodge online applications for the visitor subclass 600 visa, including New Zealand, the Philippines, Kenya, South Africa and Bosnia and Herzegovina. We will improve customer access to the Tourist Refund Scheme, saving travellers time and money by introducing a limited self-service on internet or mobile devices prior to the time of departure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For tourism operators needing to employ from abroad, we are increasing the period of sponsorship approval for employers from three to five years and streamlining the processing of sponsorship, nomination and visa applications for low-risk and accredited employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again for travellers, we will lift restrictions on using personal electronic devices so travellers can use their PEDs during all phases of flights. This will provide annual compliance savings of $17.7 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Removing the requirement for heavy vehicle operators of B-double truck combinations registered under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme to fit additional spray suppression devices will provide annual compliance savings of $8.3 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken on a few of the many measures that will make a difference in our daily lives. Following this year's repeal day on 18 March 2015, this government would have repealed more than 10,300 legislative instruments and introduced legislation to repeal 2,700 acts of parliament. While this government repairs the debt and deficit disaster left by the former Labor government, it is determined to forge ahead where and when it can to repeal regulatory burdens and make a difference to everyday Australians.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  Each of these bills before us deserves some consideration. The first is the Omnibus Repeal Day (Autumn 2015) Bill 2015. This bill amends and repeals 14 acts across seven portfolios: Agriculture, Environment, Health, Indigenous affairs, Social Services, Treasury and Veterans' Affairs. The great majority of these repeals have simply no deregulatory savings attached. In fact, there are just two deregulatory savings in the bill, totalling just over $41.4 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first saving is an amendment to the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995. It removes the requirement for a separate statutory declaration to be signed and witnessed for compensation claims under the act. The HOS(C) Act:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ requires the recovery of Commonwealth funds, including Medicare benefits â€¦ paid to claimants for health and other services when they receive a judgment â€¦ resulting from a compensation claim where a claimant has received $5,000 or more.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is from the explanatory memorandum. Claimants can now declare that the required information is correct using existing forms. That act will also be amended to 'remove the requirement for both compensation payer and claimant to sign a notification to'â€”</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BIRD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  I want to take the opportunity this evening to provide a report to the House on a matter of critical significance in my electorate. I have touched on it briefly in a previous speech, but I want to take the opportunityâ€”given that on Monday the Minister for Industry and Science convened a roundtable in Wollongongâ€”to update the House on what is happening. This, of course, relates to the very difficult circumstance we face as a community with the BlueScope Steel company having made it clear in public forums now, post their ASX statement, that they are faced with two options to remain viable in the steel production area into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first option, which we hope for and have some optimism will be successful, is to restructure the workforce business to make savings of around $200 million per year. Their view is that that should put them on a sustainable footing to continue in the steel production business. There is a very sad and difficult outcome of that optionâ€”that is, it looks like around 500 people will lose their jobs. So, as you can imagine, that would have a very significant potential impact in our region. The second option, option B, as they describe it, is to close down steel production. So we are all workingâ€”at the government level, the community level, the trade union movement and the businessâ€”to make sure that we can best position the outcome to be option A, but also, more broadly, to look at ways in which we can support the community through what is a difficult time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would remind the House that this is a similar situation to that which we faced in 2010, when the company previously had to restructure the business. We lost over 800 workers at that point in time and the federal and state governments worked with the company and the community to put in place a number of initiatives to assist with that transition. I very much welcomeâ€”along with my colleague, the member for Throsbyâ€”Minister Macfarlane convening a roundtable in Wollongong on Monday, which I think was a constructive opportunity to bring everybody together. We reached, broadly, four agreements. I am pleased to report that there was unanimous support around the room for the long-term viability of steel-making in the region, and a number of proposals in support of that were put forward for the minister's consideration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would bring to the House's attention the fact that there was a motion in the Senate today, which was moved by the Greens and supported by Labor, but, sadly, not supported by the government on this occasion. It has in it some very constructive suggestions about ways in which we could use the antidumping regime to take some emergency action to support the steel-making industry. I would ask the government, while they may not have found themselves able to support that motion, to look at the content of it and see if there are ways they can integrate that into their response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also a commitment to the long-term diversification of the regional economy. This is something that has been ongoing and it is something that I think we have been very successful at, but I think we need continued support by all levels of government in that process. That could include projects such as the expanded use of the port, and I want to acknowledge the work of Senator Fierravanti-Wells. We have been able, in a bipartisan way, to provide support around opportunities for Defence activity at the port. It should also include progressing construction of the Maldon-Dombarton rail link, which at the moment sits with the state government after an expression of interest process. I hope that they are able to move quickly on progressing that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also obviously critically important that we provide assistance to those workers who are going to be made redundant. One of the things we have asked the minister to talk to the employment minister about is reinstating the local employment coordinator. That job can work very effectively to assess the skills and abilities of the workforce who are being displaced, as well as the job opportunities in the community and the appropriate training and extra support needed to transition those workers into the new opportunities. We also asked the minister to talk to the Minister for Communications, as the government has announced there are around 4Â½ thousand new positions, nationally, in the NBN construction process. We asked if, perhaps, he could convene a jobs forum with NBN contractors to work with those local workers and see whether, with some additional training, they can get opportunities in that construction process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great outcome. I thank the minister and I hope that the actions immediately follow the roundtable.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00BCM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HENDY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  I rise today in support of the many small businesses and consumers in my electorate of Eden-Monaro. Members would be aware that the final report of the Competition Policy Review, known as the Harper reviewâ€”after the chairman, Professor Ian Harperâ€”was released on 31 March of this year. Conducting the review was a major small business policy promise that the coalition made before the last election. One of the many sensible and workable recommendations of this review was a change to the provisions on the misuse of market power. Section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act currently prohibits corporations that have a substantial degree of market power from taking advantage of that power by eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor, preventing the entry of that person into the market or deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is designed, in part, to protect small businesses from such things as predatory behaviour by large businesses. For example, in a generic sense, it would ideally protect those companies in a supply-chainâ€”such as farmers selling to large retailersâ€”from large businesses who might otherwise use their commercial muscle to squeeze out all the profitability of the farmer. The big issue here is that an imbalance in market power is not, in itself, something that is offensive. It is, in fact, a normal feature of commercial transactions. What should concern and engage us as policymakers is when strong market power is exploited through the imposition of unreasonable obligations on suppliers and business customers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For twenty years there has been a debate in Australia, especially within the small business community, about the failure of section 46 to fulfil its purpose. The most commonly proposed reform is that the aforementioned prohibition should be revised or expanded to include what is called an effects test. Very simply put, the test would not simply ask whether the big business had the purpose of reducing competition through its actions but whether it actually had the effect of doing so. I have followed the debate closely; indeed, I have been an active participant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many would know, I was the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry for around six years. ACCI is the nation's largest and most representative business group. It represents both the big end of town and the small end. It represents all the big businesses that are members of the Business Council of Australia and it also represents tens of thousands of small businesses. I have always thought of competition laws as being a bit like a children's see-saw in a playground. If it is weighted too much on one side it does not work properly, and many small business people think it is weighted too much in the favour of big business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was at ACCI we opposed the effects test. However, what is being proposed by Professor Harper and his committee is a very different option to what has been talked about for 20 years. They are proposing a complete revamp of section 46, which concentrates on the public interest issue of diminishing competition in a market as opposed to proving the compartmentalised tests that are a lawyer's feast in the existing section 46, which is why today I support Professor Harper's proposal even though the usual suspects at the Business Council of Australia oppose it. Importantly, my old organisation, ACCI, which cares about the balance between big and small business, also supports the Harper review recommendations. I have always believed that a more effective mechanism to combat the abuse of market power is an important measure to safeguard the norms of acceptable commercial behaviour and to protect efficient market outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most common argument against the section 46 Harper reform is that it would act to chill competitive behaviour by players in the market, resulting in outcomes that would be harmful to the consumer. However, I agree with Rod Sims, the chairman of the ACCC, when he supports the new effects test. A former ACCC chairman, Alan Fels, also supports the change. The Harper proposal shifts the test away from the purpose of a firm's actions to the effect of a firm's actions regardless of intent. This is an entirely sensible approach. As I said earlier, under the current provision, the ACCC can only intervene if it can prove two thingsâ€”that a firm took advantage of market power and that it intended to do so. This makes enforceability of the provision extremely difficult.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By adopting an effects test, the ACCC could act if a company's actions were proven to have resulted in a decrease in competition. Not only will it provide clarity and improve enforceability but it will also bring Australia into line with other countries including the United States and Canada.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the recommendation of Harper with respect to section 46 and I encourage my colleagues to do likewise.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  On Monday we marked two years since the election of the Abbott government. That night, the Prime Minister declared 'a good government is one that governs for all Australians'. Such promising statements are not uncommon from members opposite yet the only true test of a government's performance is its leadership, not merely its salesmanship. So let us compare this government's rhetoric to its record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst this government may boast it 'is building and maintaining a prosperous and cohesive multicultural nation', it is appalling record shows otherwise. After two years in office the Abbott government has not moved to articulate a clear policy on multiculturalism whilst simultaneously cutting $33 million from programs and organisations that are actively working to promote an inclusive and harmonious society. It has also slashed funding to the SBS, breaking an explicit promise by the then opposition leader the night before the election that there would be no cuts to the SBS. It tried to deny migrants the chance to be reunited with their loved ones through the attempted abolition of the non-contributory visa and other family visa categories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Far from deterring this government, such contradictions seem to only embolden its determination to say one thing and then do the exact opposite. This was personified on 24 February of this year when the Prime Minister incredulously stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I think it is important that we indicate; as a government, as a community, as a legal system that there is no place for inciting racial and religious vilification in our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this is the case then why did he launch a nonsensical attack on section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act seeking to explicitly permit racial vilification and intimidation 'in the course of participating in the public discussion'? In attempting to sell these ridiculous proposed amendments to the act, the Attorney-General also found it appropriate to defend the rights of 'bigots' and belittle the effect racial vilification has on an individual's personal identity and to our cohesion as a multicultural society as merely 'hurt feelings'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the Prime Minister's assurances that any watering down of Section 18C is off the table, we still see certain coalition members pushing for protections against racist hate speech to be weakened with a bill in the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at the Prime Minister's statement from September 26 last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am determined to do everything I can to promote national unity and I'm also determined to do everything I reasonably can to crack down on the preachers of hate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well whilst the Prime Minister has determined to ban certain ministers from appearing on an ABC panel show, he has outright refused to ban, or even condemn, members of his Government from addressing Reclaim Australia ralliesâ€”rallies which Australia's Race Discrimination Commissioner, Dr Tim Soutphommasane, has correctly noted are 'organised racist movements â€¦ [where] people sporting Nazi tattoos and other insignia have been openly parading their extremist sympathies... and peddling messages of fear, hatred and division'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, during the last election campaign the Prime Minister vowed:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ an incoming coalition cabinet...will never seek to divide Australian against Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet members of his government have done just that, embarking on a duplicitous and inflammatory campaign which seeks to stereotype and amplify negative attitudes so that it grossly distorts the reality of our cultural diversity. Case in point: Senator Bernardi's ludicrous assertion that halal certification processes are a 'racket which have been used to fund organisations linked to proscribed extremist organisations'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be clear, these actions are not simply controversial, but, rather, they are an attempt by certain members of government, with all the influence it entails, to give legitimacy to the repugnant concept of discriminating amongst our citizens according to their race, colour and creed. Even the Minister for Agriculture has rightly labelled this ridiculous campaign as 'unnecessary heat' and noted the 'quite devastating' impact this bullying campaign could have on 'thousands of meat workers in Australia' which could see the price of beef triple and the sector becoming unviable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than condemn such overt discrimination, however, the Prime Minister found it appropriate to marginalise Muslim-Australians by stating:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I've often heard Western leaders describe Islam as 'a religion of peace'. I wish more Muslim leaders would say that more often and mean it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the Prime Minister could seek advice from the former ASIO director-general David Irvine, who was moved to note in a speech last year: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In my experience the overall leadership of the community of Muslim Australians in dealing with these issues â€¦ has been outstanding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In this sense, the Australian Muslim community has made, and will continue to make, its own valuable contributions to our national character, our national livelihood, our national security and to our national cohesion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also sought to impose segregation on certain members of the public visiting Parliament House, by forcing women wearing head and facial coverings to sit in glassed enclosures rather than the public galleriesâ€”one of the most nonsensical episodes in the history of this parliament. No individual should ever be deemed a greater or lesser Australian because of their culture or beliefs. No government should make it even harder for citizens to feel safe and welcome in the Australian community.</span>

The first one is the Iluka Public School netball team. Iluka progressed to the final eight in the New South Wales PSSA netball competition by winning the Daily Examiner Shield last week. This was a major achievement for the school, beating Pottsville, which is a much larger school, of 600 students, in the last round. The team is going to compete on Monday at Olympic Park in Homebush. I congratulate Grace Donsworth, Emily Sevior, Cassi Wesener, Reminy Holmes, Brooke Crompton, Isla Brittain, Molly Deakin, Amelia Kennedy and Mila Knopke for that great success. I know Phil Bradmore will have great pride in taking them to Sydney. Go, girls!</span>

They were far too quick for their opposition. I acknowledge the players, Zac Beecher, Jayden Coldwell Jackey, Michael Dwayne, Tim Foster, Dan Gibson, Lyam Ible, Jay Meaney, Nick Meaney, Dylan Montgomery, Kane Montgomery, Matt Painter, Jess Perry, Les Roberts, Nikko Roberts, Rory Skinner, Michael Thomas, Tommy Watkins and Dylan Wilson, as well as Tyler Iverson, the coach; Troy Johnstone, the assistant coach; Daniel McIntosh, the runner; and Scott Redford, the football manager. It was a great game. There was a big crowd there last weekend. The team won very, very easily in the end. I just want to make a special mention of Zac Beecher and Nick Meaney, who are friends of my son. They are both only 18 years old and have played in their second premiership, so well done, guys.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PARKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  As the federal representative for an electorate that is home to WA's largest port, which caters both to cargo and to a growing number of cruise ship visits, and an electorate that is proudly home to the largest branch of the Maritime Union of Australia, I am dismayed at the Abbott government's proposed changes to coastal shipping. Like a number of my colleagues on this side of the House, I strongly supported the reform work of the former Labor government, led by the member for Grayndler, to ensure Australia has a viable coastal shipping industry in future. By contrast, the Abbott government supports encouraging shipping operators to move to foreign-flagged ships for the specific purpose of avoiding Australian workplace pay and conditions. This is exactly what was suggested, more than once, by senior federal government officials when North Star Cruises Australia approached the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development. The startling advice given to North Star Cruises is the inevitable consequence of this unconscionable bill and will likely be the advice on offer to a number of operators if the Abbott government follows through on its intention to return to the Howard government approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government's shipping regulation vandalism goes ahead, then North Star Cruises Australia, which has a presence in Fremantle and operates luxury adventure cruises on its yacht, <span style="font-style:italic;">True North</span>, in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, will face competition from foreign operators paying far lower wages in Australian waters throughout the 180-day touring season. Under the proposed legislation, it is only after 183 days operating in Australian waters that foreign-flagged vessels will be required to pay employees Australian award wages. Australian-flagged vessels will obviously suffer in this scenario. As The Australia Institute observed in its submission to the Senate inquiry:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Foreign flagged and crewed ships already have considerable access to the Australian coastal shipping market, making Australian coastal shipping possibly the only service sector facing competition that can use foreign labour while actually operating in Australia. By contrast it is impossible for foreign trucking companies, rail companies or any other service provider to operate in Australia using international labour paid at international rates. As crewing costs make up between 36 per cent and 42 per cent of ship operating costs, this puts Australian crews at a 15-20 per cent disadvantage against international ships in terms of operating costs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, the bill's own cost-benefit ratio analysis indicates that 93 per cent or 1,089 of coastal shipping jobs will be lost with the changes and will only result in 200 new jobs in other industries. Clearly, such devastation of domestic maritime employment does not serve the best interests of Australian workers or the long-term health of Australian shipping. </span>

This legislation will instead deter investment in a domestic fleet, erode the skills required of a maritime workforce and make Australia complicit in the exploitation of foreign workers. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the MUA has noted in its exhaustive submission to the Senate inquiry, most of Australia's key defence and trading partnersâ€”the USA, Canada, Indonesia, China, Japan, Brazil, India, and the European Unionâ€”have maintained maritime cabotage, or preferential treatment for domestically flagged ships. The MUA also noted that 'Australian cabotage is already one of the most liberal in the world, and any further erosion will put Australia completely out of step with its trading partners and Defence allies.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last month, I attended the 30th annual commemoration of the Allied Merchant Seamen's Association at the Flying Angel Club in Fremantle, and reflected on the service that Australian-flagged ships have provided to our country since 1885. In war and in peace time, Australian mariners have come to the aid of our country with no complaint and little recognition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Operating in the area since 1987, North Star Cruises Australia has an intimate knowledge of the Kimberley coastline. In nearly 30 years of operation, the company has grown from three to 50 Australian employees and it takes seriously the responsibility of cultural and environmental stewardship by fostering and maintaining strong links with the traditional owners and ensuring the protection of coastal areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been the hallmark of this government to focus on undoing the positive reforms that Labor established, whether or not there is any pressing reason for doing soâ€”and irrespective of the harm involved. This is another example. Coastal shipping and the viability of Australian owned and flagged vessels are important to an island nation like Australia. Pursuing an ideological vendetta against workers and unions and, indeed, against proud Australian businesses by forcing operators to seek a foreign flag and foreign workers for their ships is madness.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247742" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOWARTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  As the federal member for Petrie, I want people in my electorate to know that every day over the last two years, I have been very focused on jobs for my electorate. I want the people in my electorate who are unemployed and who are leaving school and looking for work to know that I am thinking about them in every way and doing what I can to help ensure that we have an environment for business in our electorate where there are opportunities for people looking for work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government, we are committed to real jobs for all Australians. We have a strategy to make this happen with programs like Work for the Dole; work experience opportunities with the private sector; Green Army projects for young people; Australian Defence Force gap year; a comprehensive reform package for the vocational education training, VET, sector; and trade support loans for apprentices, people wanting to become tradies. We have also reformed the job services providers through jobactive, so that they are very focused on outcomes for people who are unemployed. But I want to talk about what I am doing locally to encourage job growth in the Petrie electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to mention the job seeker boot camp I will be running on 29 October. I have run a number of small-business breakfasts as well as unemployment services with people who are looking for work. This boot camp is for young people, and older people, who are looking for work. It is an opportunity where they can mix with local employers who can pass on some tips about what it is that they look for when hiring, and what they are looking for when they get lots of different resumes and what stops a resume from going in the bin. Job seekers can mix with these business owners and have the opportunity to network and get a better understanding about what it is that they are looking for in a resume, the sort of work ethic they are looking for and how best to perform in an interview.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have some speakers who will be coming along, including Mark and David from Packer Leather, a great company in my electorate of Petrie; Jake from Tanda, a young entrepreneur who is doing very well with his university graduates and in a short time his business is now turning over $2 million a year; Deborah from The Butterfly Experience; and Michael from Kennedy's Timbers. I want to thank them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Employers create jobs and I thank the small-business owners in my electorate as often as I can for what they are doing. They are creating jobs and opportunities for young people and giving them a purpose. Today, I want to mention Denis and Judy Hickey from Bracken Ridge who are up in the gallery this afternoon. It is great to see them in the parliament. Thank you for what you are doing as locals in my electorate. They have lived in Bracken Ridge for over 40 years. The Hickeys run a number of newsagencies just outside my electorate at Nextra Chermside newsagency at Westfield Chermsideâ€”they have three there. In the 40 years that they have been operating this business, they have employed hundreds of staff. I asked Judy today what she looks for in an employee? She said that she looks for people with a great work ethic, someone who wants to work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have a good mentoring program within their newsagencies, where they partner one of their employees who have been employed for, say, three years with a young person who has just landed a job there to mentor them. It is something I am speaking to year 12s about as well who are about to leave school in the next few months. I say to them that if they are not going straight into the workforce and they are going to study, make sure they get a casual or part-time job like some of the people here in the parliament who are studying and working part time. It gives them the opportunity as they learn to apply that in a job. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I talk about mentoring. If they want to be a plumber, an entrepreneur, a tradie or a lawyer, I tell them to try to find someone they can partner up withâ€”a lot like the Hickeys in their Nextra businesses where they give people mentoring opportunities. Lastly, goal setting is very importantâ€”use the opportunity to look for goals. This applies to everyone who is unemployed in my electorate. They need to know that as the federal member, I care about them and I will do everything I can every day to ensure there are opportunities for them. Finally, we sell our young people short if we allow them to drift into a life of welfare dependency. So do not forget my job seeker boot camp on 29 October at Mermaid's CafÃ© in Deception Bay. You are welcome to come along.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:30</span>):  Over the course of the last couple of weeks, I have been conducting mobile offices in my electorate. Last week, at Mascot, Pagewood and Botany, I received numerous complaints from constituents regarding the Baird government's cuts to the 309, X09, 310 and X10 bus services from the south-east into the city. These are very popular bus routes, and I know this because, when I lived in William Street in Botany, that was the bus that I used to get to get into the city every morning to work. Most of the people that travel on that service get off after Central Station. Because of the plans to build the light rail to the eastern suburbs, the Baird government is cutting the vital part of that particular service, so that service will now terminate at Central: it will not continue on down Elizabeth Street to Circular Quay, as it has in the past, taking most of those commuters into the City.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This will be a massive inconvenience for many people in our community. It will add 20 minutes both ways to the bus journey. It is a big inconvenience in particular for the young, the elderly and the disabled. But it will not only inconvenience people but also increase the cost of commuting to and from work and school and into the City each day, because commuters will now have to get off the bus at Central and either get onto a train or get onto another bus service and again tag on with their Opal card if they are going to continue into the City.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned a moment ago, the reason that the Baird government has given for the cut to this service is the work that is occurring along George Street in beginning to build the eastern suburbs light rail project. The thing about this is that that does not make any sense at all, because the 309, 310, X09 and X10 bus services do not go down George Street; they go down Elizabeth Street. So this has nothing to do with the work that is going on on George Street for the eastern suburbs light rail but everything to do with what Liberal governments do with public transport services, and that is to cut them. That is exactly what the Baird government is doing in this case. It is cutting the most vital part of that service, at a massive inconvenience to constituents in my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of this and as a result of the complaints that I have had from constituents, I have written to the New South Wales transport minister and I have asked the minister to reconsider this bad decision and consider reinstalling those bus services. At the very least, the minister should consider offering free second rides to those people who are forced to change services at Central and get onto another service.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:33</span>):  One of the big issues facing regional families, small business and farming operations, particularly those in remote areas of Capricornia, is access to reliable digital and mobile phone services. That is why our coalition government is rolling out its $100 million program to help fix some of these black spot areas around Australia. I am pleased that four new mobile phone base towers will be built around Capricornia, at a cost of $3.14 million. These towers will be at Clarke Creek, about two hours north-west of Rockhampton; at Marlborough; at Mount Chalmers Road between Rockhampton and Yeppoon; and at Gargett, a rural area in the Pioneer Valley west of Mackay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These projects will be covered under round 1 of our Mobile Black Spots Program, which recognises that families in regional Australia matter just as much as those in the capital cities. Fifteen out of 71 mobile black spots nominated in Capricornia will be addressed under this round. While there is plenty more to do, this is a good start and a far better improvement than when Capricornia was in the hands of Labor. Further coverage will be provided by hand-held or external antennae to Cawarral Road, Keppel Sands Road, Clarke Creek and the Pioneer Valley areas of Finch Hatton, Pinevale, Gargett, Pinnacle, Mia Mia, Septimus, Mirani and Svendsen Road. Mobile phone services will also improve on the Bruce Highway and other main roads, including between Marlborough and Sarina roads; Mount Chalmers Road at the intersection of Sleipner Road; and Yeppoon Road between Rockhampton and Yeppoon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to highlight the community of Clarke Creek and local mother Lynise Conaghan, who has been tireless in leading a campaign to improve services in the area for many years. Thank you, Lynise; you are a great advocate for your community. In fact, on one visit to Clarke Creek, I labelled it as a place worse than Africa when it comes to mobile phone black spotsâ€”because you can make a mobile phone call from Central Africa but not from Clarke Creek in Central Queensland, and the school curriculum took 20 hours to download.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also keen to help other small rural communities such as Stanage Bay to improve mobile services. I have been talking to locals including Trudy Mace, whose children are educated on the family's remote cattle station via the Capricorn School of Distance Education. I look forward to continuing to support them just as I did for Clarke Creek.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:36</span>):  The latest UNHCR report shows that, at the end of 2014, there were 59.4 million forcibly displaced people in the world. That included 19.5 million refugees, half of them children. An equally disturbing statistic is that, in just 12 months, the number of displaced persons rose by 8.3 million. That means, on average, every day last year another 42,500 people became refugees. These figures do not include the number of people who have fled Syria in recent months. They continue to flee and it has reached crisis point in Syria's neighbouring countries and throughout Europe. It is estimated that about two million have fled, mainly from Syria, since the start of this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day we hear new reports of refugees swamping parts of Europe, where local communities simply cannot cope with the influx. Sadly, many of the refugees, possibly thousands, never reach their destination because they die in tragic circumstances along the way. Some of those deaths are known and reported, but I doubt whether all of them are. If has become a massive global humanitarian problemâ€”perhaps worse than anything else that has happened since the end of World War IIâ€”for which there does not appear to be any immediate solution. Whilst it is a global problem, disappointingly not all countries are contributing to relief efforts or opening their doors to the people fleeing. That, however, should be no excuse for Australia doing the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Millions of refugees are often left for years in squalid, unsafe refugee camps with little hope of ever being resettled. Stopping boat arrivals is one matter, but resettling genuine refugees languishing in refugee camps is another. Indeed, it was Australia that played a key role in drafting the international refugee convention. Yesterday the Australian government announced an additional intake of 12,000 refugees fleeing Syria. Having earlier called for an intake of an additional 10,000 refugees, Labor supports that commitment; however, I understand that not all Australians will. The additional intake will not make a huge dent in the total number of global refugees, but for those 12,000 it will make a world of difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the same vein, it is time that more is done to resettle the 1,700-odd refugees currently being held at Nauru and Manus Island, many of whom I understand have now also been there for years. Leaving their country, for whatever reason, is not a crime. People should not be kept indefinitely in makeshift refugee camps, which are now the subject of serious concerns raised by credible independent observers and government investigations. It is time that every effort is made to find a new home for those people. It makes both humanitarian sense and economic sense to do so.</span>

We all remember the storm event that occurred in Dungog on 21 April. We lost lives, people's homes were lost and properties were damaged. I give a bouquet to Brigadier Darren Naumann, who did a tremendous job as the state government delegate to take over the recovery operations. He worked with the council, the state government and the federal government to deliver real outcomes. There were a plethora of insurance claims that came through, and on 1 July, when the Prime Minister and I visited the affected people in the Dungog region, some expressed concerns about the reluctance and recalcitrance of insurance companies.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the engagement of my office with people from NRMA, I can say that, in every claim that we have raised with the NRMA where there has been questionability, the NRMA has supported those claims and deemed them to be from the effects of storm. Sadly, Allianz have done everything they can do to avoid paying claims. What Allianz have done is to shop around for reports that say it is a flooding event rather than a storm event, just to get out of paying insurance claims. I say to Allianzâ€”and we have repeatedly made representations to them on behalf of my constituentsâ€”you are very quick to take the dollars from my constituents for their insurance; you need to be equally quick in settling claims in a fair and reasonable manner. Shopping around for reportsâ€”sending numbers of inspectors in until you get the report that you wantâ€”does not cut the mustard. I will continue to name and shame and to point out exact street addresses and what you didâ€”the insurance policy amount that you took and how you have failed to live up to your obligations as an insurer. As I say, you have been quick to take the dollars but very, very slow to pay out the dollars. Get a heart or continue to suffer the pain of being named and shamed in this place as nothing more than charlatans who take my constituents' money and then refuse to pay the claims on the day that you should. It is just not acceptable.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem has been compounded by the New South Wales department of fair trading from 16 September 2009, when they took away the licensing requirement for home inspectors to be licensed. It means that anyone with what is deemed to be a qualification can provide these reports to insurance companies that they are using to get out of paying claims. It is not acceptable.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You can see that many hands have worked on these blankets, each person has contributed a little time and effort to make something beautiful for a person at the end of their life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have observed in the past that Canberra has cemented its place in Australia as not just the nation's capital and the bush capital but also the social capital. Canberrans are more likely to join, volunteer and give than people in other parts of Australia. This simple act of kindness shows that the patients and staff at the Interchange General Practice are building the nation's social capital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Kate Reid from the Interchange General Practice said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Hundreds of knitters have contributed, a few rows or many squares, which are then sewn together into colourful blankets for people who are being cared for by Palliative Care ACT.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She said, 'It is so gratifying to walk out to the waiting room and see people knitting away.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lincraft Canberra Centre has generously supported the knitting circle by providing wool and knitting needles, and even crochet hooks for those who do not knit. Dr Christine Phillips said that the knitters came from all backgrounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You can see how proficient some of the knitters are â€¦ they often say when they come in that they hadn't noticed how long the wait was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Interchange General Practice was founded in 1980 and is located in the centre of Canberra in close proximity to the CBD, not far from its original location at the Canberra bus interchange. I would like to commend the good work they do in providing quality care services to members of the Canberra community and bringing them closer together. I would like to thank Tuck Meng Soo, principal of the Interchange General Practice, Kate Reid, Denise Krauss, Christine Phillips and the rest of the staff at the Interchange General Practice for the wonderful work that they do in making Canberra a more close-knit community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:44</span>):  This week marks 25 years of National Child Protection Week. It is an important time to raise awareness around the importance of protecting children and giving them a voice. Our government is committed to tackling child abuse and neglect, and every day we are working towards better outcomes through the delivery of the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Minister for Social Services, Scott Morrison, for the ambitious framework to focus on protecting the rights, wellbeing and development of children and young people. We have already seen significant achievements such as the release for the national standards for out-of-home care and the establishment of a National Children's Commissioner. But we know there is much more to be done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of Australia's most well known child safety advocates is Bravehearts founder and CEO, Hetty Johnston. Hetty has done tremendous work across Australia to help educate thousands of children on personal safety and to support many children and their families. She has also worked with the government on legislative reform to improve child protection. As part of Child Protection Week, Bravehearts hosts White Balloon Day on 11 September. This year I have signed up as a children's champion to help raise funds and awareness for this important cause. In my electorate of Forde, we have a fantastic Bravehearts team in Beenleigh who go above and beyond to help children and families in our local community. On Friday I will be hosting a White Balloon Day fundraiser at Zarraffa's in Beenleigh. There will be a donation box available for people to come down and make donations. I am very pleased to be able to help raise funds for such an important cause.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our children need to be protected and given a voice, and Bravehearts is one of the most important organisations in Australia proving that service. I would also like to recognise the Kingston East Neighbourhood Group at Slacks Creek for hosting a family fun day today in support of National Child Protection Week. We have many fantastic organisations in our community that provide a wide range of resources and support to our families and children. They say it takes an entire village to raise a child and that notion is very relevant today. The parents, friends, teachers and the various organisations and services that make up our community all offer the support and help we need in raising, protecting and providing for our children. I thank them all for the wonderful work that they do.</span>

                  </a>  I thank the House and I thank members opposite for their willingness to accept this. I have a petition from the Glen Waverley Anglican Church which reads as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This petition from the members of the Glen Waverley Anglican Church, 800 Waverley Road, Glen Waverley, draws to the attention of Alan Griffin MP the $1 billion cut to the foreign aid budget. As followers of Jesus Christ, we strongly believe that wealthy nations such as Australia have a moral obligation to make a meaningful contribution to the global effort to eradicate poverty. We are disturbed by the cuts to the foreign aid budget and urge you as the federal member for Bruce in the Australian parliament to speak out against them as an advocate for the people in our region who are struggling against poverty.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with a heavy heart that I read that, because I know members on both sides of the House understand. Many of us have been to places that receive Australian foreign aidâ€”yourself included, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott. We have seen the excellent work that is done on behalf of the Australian government to support people in need in various parts of our region and in various parts of the world, and we know that this is something which needs to be supported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand and I do not wish to be heavily political in this, but both sides prior to the last election and over the years have been supportive of the Millennium Development Goals and of pushing towards the goal of setting 0.7 per cent of gross national income as a basis for aid into the future. But unfortunately that is not where we are headed now, and that is something that I think both sides of the House need to reflect on in the years ahead. Again, I do not wish to be political but I wish to say that we need to redevelop a consensus on foreign aid. We need to redevelop a commitment to increase our foreign aid into the future. We ought to note that governments such as the conservative government in the United Kingdom have now legislated for 0.7 per cent of GNI to be the basis of their aid budget and have actually reached that target.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is much more to be done in this area. The representatives of the church, which included Bek and Gary McClellan, pointed me towards a YouTube video from Charlie Pickering, the comedian on <span style="font-style:italic;">The Weekly</span> show, where he gave an explanation of foreign aid. I have to say it was funny but it was also tragic in terms of some of the key points that it made. He made the point that effectively what we are seeing now is the lowest level of foreign aid that we have seen as a percentage of GNI as a result of these cuts than we have ever had. It is back to the levels of the 1950s, before even I was born. The circumstances are that when we look to the future, and he made a point that the circumstances areâ€”</span>

                  </a>  Not quite, Member for Wannon. He made the point, when talking about the aid budget as a piece of the pie, that aid is such a small piece of the budget pie that we are actually giving the bits of the pie that are stuck to the knife when you cut it. That is what we are dealing with here. Foreign aid does help: it helps us by ensuring that our neighbours are better able to deal with their problems, and that helps us as good neighbours in the region that needs assistance.</span>

Today the social services minister introduced legislation that will remove tests and restrictions on Youth Allowance that has prevented thousands of young people from accessing payments and kept others from receiving the support they need, especially in helping them to be able to access tertiary education. For rural and regional families, supporting a child in further education is expensive. It often means the child has to moving away to university or to a TAFE to learn a trade. These young Australians cannot just nip home for lunch or do a load of washing. The cost of living is something that they face up front and in full. They have to pay rent, they have to try to find part-time work, they have to be able to try to get home. All of these costsâ€”rent, fuelâ€”add up for these young Australians. Providing youth allowance to these people is incredibly important. If our young students from rural areas are expected to be given the kinds of opportunities provided to those in the city, common sense must be applied to the challenges that face them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Warrnambool, in my electorate, we recently held a forum to discuss these challenges. I was joined by Senator Bridget McKenzie and representatives from the department of education and the Department of Social Services in engaging with students, parents and teachers on this issue. The overwhelming view was that there are significant financial barriers to school leavers from rural and regional areas in accessing further education. Rural Industries Skill Training chief executive, Bill Hamill, told the hearing in Warrnambool that living away from home expenses concerned regional parents more than the fees to go to university. Very simply, the costs put on these students is far greater than on their city counterparts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the coalition government has taken the first step in reducing this burden on students by changing the youth allowance payment assessment process. By removing the family assets test, for example, around 4,100 more students will become eligible for youth allowance payments for the first time. This will mean each of these young people will get an extra $7,000 each year on average to help with their cost of living. The government will also change parental income tests in relation to applying for youth allowance. This will mean that 13,700 families will have children become eligible for more in their payments, around 1,100 more each year. This is a great first step by this government, but there is more to do in this area and rural MPs from the coalition will be fighting for this.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3E" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:53</span>):  Today I rise to speak about Ms Trudy Rainey, a constituent of mine who has been placed in a very difficult situation through the incompetence of the previous coalition government. The Howard government's Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme was a program run between 1997 and 2001. It was intended to allow farmers and their partners the option of transferring the farm to the younger generation without it affecting their eligibility for pensions. In 1998, Ms Rainey's parents joined the RAFS and their family farm was transferred to Trudy and her sister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of the participation in the government initiated scheme and its inadequate parameters around the proper transfer of assets, Ms Rainey has now been forced into significant financial and emotional stress as she faces the loss of the family farm and her future. Sixteen years after the farm was transferred under the RAFS, the mother initiated property settlement proceedings against the father in the Family Court as a result of a relationship breakdown. The result was a ruling in favour of Ms Rainey's mother, with her being awarded more than $300,000 plus court costs to be paid within 90 days of the judgement as her share of the farm asset.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the ruling the judge remarked that the government of the day had not given due considerations to situations like this arising from the RAFS. The only option available to Ms Rainey as a result of the ruling is to either sell the family farm as a whole or break it up into pieces. If the farm is broken up and the farm does not remain a viable concern, Ms Rainey will be forced off the land to an uncertain future. After a lifetime of farming and giving up opportunities for further education, Ms Rainey's capacity for employment outside of the farm is bleak, further exacerbating the impact of the loss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The clear intent of the Howard government's RAFS was to provide an incentive for people such as Ms Rainey to stay on the family farm while allowing the parents access to social security. The Raineys entered into this arrangement in good faith and because of the security offered by the RAFS legislation. Ms Rainey wanted to help her parents and forge a career in farming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have written to the Minister for Social Services, who basically said, 'Well, she can apply for Centrelink benefits'. I contacted the Minister for Agriculture in February this year. His reply in May tried to simply fob off Ms Rainey. When I wrote back to him in June informing him that he had had Ms Rainey's application for five weeks already. He responded in July that he was looking into it. It is now September and Minister Joyce has done nothing. The Department of Finance is currently considering an act-of-grace application from Ms Rainey in relation to her loss, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, the member for Riverina, may be called upon to make a decision on that application. I suggest that this government think seriously about this issue. The loss of family farms through incompetent actions of their predecessors will put the futures of many family farms at risk. I hope that they reconsider the position and help Ms Rainey, not only for her sake but for the 3,000-plus family farms that took up the RAFS in good faith all those years ago. The coalition talks a big game on being the voice for farmers. Let's see if their actions match their rhetoric.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WHITELEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:56</span>):  Before I was elected I travelled through the electorate of Braddon hosting community cuppas wherever and whenever I could. I invited residents to meet me over a cup of tea or coffee and a bickie to discuss any issues that they wanted to raise. After the election I was determined to continue with the community cuppas, and I have done so. Last week I hosted such cuppas in Ulverstone, Penguin and Sulphur Creek, taking the total now to over 30 community cuppas that I have been running since the election campaign of 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to report to the parliament some of the issues raised at these meetings. They all raised similar issues, coincidentally, with same sex marriage obviously being a big issue of discussion, and I have to say there is overwhelming support for a national vote on the issue. There was a lot of discuss about ice and the problems arising from the ice epidemic, not only in our state but around the country, as well as foreign ownership, and a lot of discussion on the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, with many questions from the audience giving me the chance to put to rest some of the fears that have been put in their minds by the unions and the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unemployment is a big issue in our region, of course, and there have been questions on superannuation taxation, with people actually thanking the government for the attempt to get the debt and deficit under control. There was also the issue of an unhealthy reliance by some in our community on government welfare. These meetings are great opportunity for people to put their views. Sulphur Creek, particularly, has an issue with mobile phone coverageâ€”or, should I say, lack of itâ€”and I am encouraging them to continue with their campaign to have this fixed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week the Penguin community lost a true gentleman. Like many of his vintage, Mr Terry McKenna served this country in the Second World War. He was an air force navigator who saw action in New Guinea, returning to devote his life to his family and his community. Following the war, Terry met and married Peg, in 1948, and they had five children. Sharing their lives together, Terry and Peg have modelled to all of us true love and commitment. For 25 years Terry was the Penguin town clerk. He was passionate about his beloved town and following his retirement in 1986 he ran for office, serving many years on the Penguin council. Two years later he was elected to the newly formed Central Coast Council. He has actually served the local government for over 44 years. It is fair to say that Terry McKenna was the driving force behind the Penguin Sports Complex and he also had a vision for this complex to be made more of a first-class sporting precinct, and it should be noted that the Central Coast Council is moving closer to the fulfilment of Terry's vision. Perhaps more important to Mr McKenna was his faith and his commitment to the Catholic Church. His commitment was not only personal but also practical. He helped rebuild the Sacred Heart Church in Ulverstone after it was damaged by fire. He was a great family man. On behalf of the electorate of Braddon, I express my deepest sympathies to Mr McKenna's family at this time.</span>

I said that I would like to share them with the parliament and with parliamentarians so they can understand someone's first-hand experience about what has happened to the sacked workers of Hutchinsons and what it means to them to be treated in this way by this company. I met with Alex as part of Labor's Fair Work Taskforce, as we travel around the country speaking to workers about their experiences, and he said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Alex Hood and I am one of the sacked workers from Hutchinson Ports. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I take the opportunity to thank â€¦ the good people here for the opportunity to speak. I have the privilege to speak today about the method of how Hutchinsons cut off employment for myself and my other â€¦ colleagues on the waterfront. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am an everyday working-class man with a fantastic wife and a beautiful 9-year-old daughter. These 2 ladies rely on me to provide them with a home, food and clothes and all the essentials, and I have been fortunate enough to do this successfully until now. Because I was terminated in the middle of the night by email.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the words of an ordinary, everyday, working-class man. This is the situation that this company has placed these employees in. It is unacceptable that any employee is notified via email or text message in the middle of the night that their employment has ceased. It is unacceptable and un-Australian to treat workers this way. We have seen from this government not support, not compassion for these hardworking Australians but only a slap in the face and the minister responsible for this area, Senator Eric Abetz, saying that it was within the company's right to do that. It is not fair. This worker, Alex, wrote these words on his daughter's school notebook. He wrote them when he was at the picket line, demanding a fair go for all Australians. I am proud today to say that I stand with Alex and his co-workers in this fight for fairness.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  I rise today to speak about something that impacts on all rural electorates in this great countryâ€”the prevalence of suicide in rural communities. Today is R U OK? Day. R U OK? Day is our national day of action, where we pause to ask about the wellbeing of our families, our friends, our colleagues and our peers. It is an initiative that seeks to expose and indeed address an endemic problem facing rural and regional communitiesâ€”suicide and self-harm. Every year around 2,000 Australians die by suicide. These tragic losses destroy not only the lives of their victims but also their families and communities. While all suicide is tragic, the incidence of suicide is 66 per cent higher in the country than it is in the major cities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rural and regional Australians are a proud bunch, and so they should be. They make a massive contribution to the wealth of this nationâ€”a contribution which sometimes goes unnoticed and unthanked. But when times are tough rural and regional Australians feel both the burden of struggle and the dreadful effect of isolation. Further, our rural Australians not only are subject to the risks and uncertainty of the business world but also face the often harsh and unforgiving vicissitudes of the Australian climate. The Australian spirit is strong in the citizens of our rural and regional communities, but isolation and lack of services have unfortunately led to a significant disparity in the rates of suicide in the country as opposed to the city. Farmers are two times more likely to die than the generally employed public. Yet in rural areas there are also vastly higher levels of participation in civic life through volunteering and informal support networks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why R U OK? Day is such an important initiative, because we should never let our own pride stand in the way of our mental health. Whilst we as a government strive to deliver better services and relief to our rural and regional communities, it behoves all of us to ask our families, friends, mates and colleagues how they are going. We should be willing to say more than 'All right, mate,' especially if we are feeling depressed and/or anxious. The old adage proves absolutely true in the prevention of suicide: a problem shared is a problem halved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let us on this day of action reach out to our fellow Australians and ask them, 'Are you okay?' In doing so, I hope that we might decrease the rates of suicide in this nation, particularly amongst our rural and regional communities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  I want to welcome the government's announcement yesterday that Australia will accept 12,000 refugees fleeing the turmoil and violence in the Middle East. I do so particularly because my electorate is already home to many earlier waves of refugees from this region and, as a result of family and community ties, I expect that the federal seat of Calwell will be one of those areas preferred as a new home and settlement for a good many of the new refugees that are about to join us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been engaged with Syrian and Iraqi communities in my electorate for many years. I genuinely understandâ€”and I want to convey to this placeâ€”the anguish that has been experienced by so many who still have family members trapped in the conflict zones or trapped in temporary refuge countries such as Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. My office receives visits and phone calls from my constituents almost on a daily basis, desperate to bring families here to Australiaâ€”to the safety of Australia. Therefore the news that some of these loved ones just may be amongst those that Australia now accepts will bring great relief to many of my local residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also welcome the fact that the intake announced yesterday will be non-discriminatory. We must always remember that what matters is the plight that people find themselves in, and not their religion or their ethnicity. My electorate is home to a large number of Chaldeans, Syriacs and Assyrians, and Coptic Christians, to name but a few. But we need to remember that in my electorate I have a very large number of constituents who are of the Muslim faith, and many of them are amongst those who are victims of persecution and violence. Everyone who is in need of safety deserves our compassion, our assistance and our welcome to a new home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There may be many Australians who are less than enthusiastic about accepting this new 12,000 intake, with this new wave of refugees. But I ask them to consider our nation's long and proud history as one of constant migration, by both those seeking a new life by choice and those forced to flee persecution. Many of the victims of the current conflict across the Middle East are highly skilled, well-educated people. We know that initially they will need our support and help to recover from dislocation and trauma to re-establish new lives, learn a new language and find their feet. We also know that this help should be understood as an investment in our community and in our nation. I am confident that these refugees, like so many migrants before them, will very soon repay this investment by working hard, building new lives and using their considerable skills and resourcefulness to contribute to Australian society. In my electorate alone, refugees and migrants who have come from war and conflict and persecution have already enriched the community in which they now live. Even within the first generation they have built new careers, started businesses, trained and retrained, and many of their children are doing very well at school, completing tertiary education and moving into leadership roles.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  I rise today to talk about a special needs school in my electorate of Macarthur, Mater Dei School, which received a $335,000 grant to build a sustainable power system for their pool. Mater Dei was originally established as an orphanage by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan order in 1910. Today, Mater Dei is a community-based organisation that provides early intervention, therapy services, education and residential programs for children and young people with an intellectual disability or developmental delay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For years I have had a close relationship with the school. In 2013, one of my election commitments was to obtain funding for them through the Community Development Grants Program so that they could afford a new solar power system to reduce the school's power bill by up to $40,000 a year. With the close support of the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, the Hon. Jamie Briggs, I am pleased to say that Mater Dei was successful in receiving $335,000 from the Abbott government and has now installed a new solar power system. The heating system has roughly 550 solar panels that cover three roof areas of the school. Mater Dei now has more than enough power to maintain a pool temperature of up to 30 degrees. Not only will it cut electricity costs for the school; it will also reduce the environmental impact of heating their hydrotherapy facility. The installation of this 150 kilowatt photovoltaic system will generate an estimated energy output of 196.5 megawatt hours annually. That will cover a substantial portion of the school's consumption requirements. It will reduce the overall energy costs and give greater independence from the electricity utility. It will offset up to 210 tonnes of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> each year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This project demonstrates the school's commitment to environmentally sound initiatives and will inspire the next generation of Australians to embrace renewable energy technologies. The system's performance can also be monitored and managed from an online portal, which will record the amount of electricity generated and CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> offsets and provide the school with an opportunity to trade green energy under the Renewable Energy Act. The money that is being saved per annum could pay for an extra teacher for two days per week or even a teacher's assistant for up to four days per week. The new solar panels installed on the roof of Mater Dei are also equivalent to taking 35 cars off the road each year. This is a significant environmental benefit not just to the school but to the wider community as well. A few weeks ago Principal Tony Fitzgerald invited me to the official opening of the school. I had the pleasure of meeting the school chaplain, Sister Jeanie Heininger; the chair of the school's board, John Adam; the school's business manager, Anne Lauder; the school's foundation manager, Simone Wilson; school P&amp;C members Karen Witherspoon and Michelle Campbell; and Ivor, Donner and David, from Solgen Energy, who installed the cutting edge system. It was great to see the children enjoying the facilities and taking advantage of the new heating system. I am incredibly thankful to Jamie Briggs and the Abbott government for supporting this smart infrastructure investment. It is an invaluable asset to the school and it is helping some of the most disadvantaged children in the country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  Unfair critics of the Prime Minister say he can never be taken at his word. However, when he described himself as 'a wavering weathervane', he was indeed accurate. It was not only about the way in which he was dragged by his backbench in regard to our refugee intake this week; on an issue that is more serious to my electorate, the NBN, he was similarly a weathervane moving with the winds. Asking a rhetorical question in December 2010 he said: 'Do we really want to invest $50 billion of hard-earned taxpayers' money in what is essentially a video entertainment system?' I guess he answered that question for himself when he said in 2013: 'I want our NBN rolled out within three years and Malcolm Turnbull is the right person to make this happen.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This inconsistency on the importance of the NBN has persisted in the government's implementation of it. Claiming that the coalition model would be cheaper to roll out and would be connected faster, Mr Abbott proposed a fibre to the node system which would leave most homes and businesses without an NBN connection unless they paid a large fee to connect their home to the node. The cost of the second-rate NBN commenced at $29.5 billionâ€”half the cost he was complaining about back in 2010. It moved to $41 billion in December 2013 and increased again, to $42 billion, in August 2014. And only last month the latest estimate was that it will now be $56 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where Labor's plan was costed at $44.1 billion and was due to be rolled out by 2021, the coalition's 'faster' model saw Mr Turnbull promise that all Australians would have access to the NBN by the end of 2016. We are a year out from that date. In south-west Sydney, in my electorate and in the Macarthur electorate, people just want an internet connection. In 2009 Australia's broadband systems download speed was estimated at 39th in the world. Since then, under this minister and this wavering Prime Minister, our international ranking has slipped to 59th place this year. Rod Tucker, Emeritus Professor at the University of Melbourne, has estimated that the shift to fibre to the node technology will cement Australia as an internet backwater and predicts Australia's world ranking to be as low as 100th by 2020.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many countries that have installed FTTN are now shifting to fibre to the premises as the original NBN rollout was being installed. This change will inevitably occur. Any short-term cost savings will pale against the long-term additional costs of reinstallation. This is a crucial issue in my electorate. I do not exaggerate figures. I do not say hundreds of people are ringing me about refugees. I say hundreds of people have rung me, within Werriwa, about the performance of this government with regard to the NBN, the costs they are incurring and the undermining of their children's education.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'DWYER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  In 2012 I first spoke in this House about an issue of serious concern to my constituentsâ€”the regular and disruptive closure of level crossings throughout my electorate. The congestion caused by these closures affects daily life, impacting upon where residents shop, where children go to school and how long it takes to get to work. Whilst the Koornang Road level crossing in Carnegie is one of the worst, it is not just in Carnegie where the impacts of level crossings are felt; it is also in Murrumbeena, Glen Iris, Malvern, Kooyong and Toorak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013 I tabled a petition in this House, signed by over 1,000 of my constituents, calling for action on the Carnegie and Murrumbeena level crossings. I was delighted when, after a number of meetings with the then transport minister, the then Victorian coalition government agreed with me and committed $2.5 billion to upgrade the entire Dandenong rail line, which included removing nine level crossings and rebuilding both Carnegie and Murrumbeena stations. The Victorian coalition government funded this in their 2014 budget, and work had been scheduled to begin this year to be completed by 2018.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, in their very first budget earlier this year, on page 23 of Budget Paper No. 4, Labor explicitly cancelled the Dandenong rail line project. Not only is it deeply concerning that this vital $2.5 billion project has been cancelled but Labor's claim that they have a replacement program to remove level crossings all over the state does not stand up to scrutiny. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Page 17 of Budget Paper No. 4 states that Labor's alleged level crossing removal program is estimated to cost $6 billion, but in the exact same line Labor has only budgeted $3 million for the programâ€”$3 million is an incredibly long way short of $6 billion. It is less than one per cent of the $6 billion. And you certainly cannot remove even one level crossing for $3 million. For a party that cannot manage a budget on their best day, this is simply incredible and defies credibility. With such an obvious funding shortfall, there is a real uncertainty about delivering the project in full, let alone by 2016 as the Victorian Labor government claims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But even in the face of his own government's budget papers, the state Labor member for Oakleigh continues to claim that Labor will remove level crossings. The state Labor member for Oakleigh promised the removal of level crossings in Carnegie and Murrumbeena during last year's state election campaign. Instead of continuing to pretend that the removal of level crossings in Carnegie and Murrumbeena are going ahead, he should come clean about what his own government's budget papers really say and he should stand up for his community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that without funding, these level crossings, or any other level crossings, cannot be removed. Instead of the $2.5 billion Dandenong rail line project funded and scheduled to start this year by the former coalition state government, residents in Carnegie and Murrumbeena have a Labor government and a Labor state member who cannot say exactly what they will do, how their new plan will be funded and are not sure when it will start, let alone finish.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen that Victoria is coming to a complete standstill under its state Labor government. The Carnegie and Murrumbeena level crossings are ranked in Victoria's top 10 worst congestion spots according to the RACV Redspot survey. Instead of delays, our community needs action on these level crossings right now.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  On Monday this week I attended an economic summit with my colleague Sharon Bird, the member for Cunningham; state and federal MPs; and local government representatives together with business leaders, union leaders and community representatives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the summit was to craft a response to the news that BlueScope has to cut $200 million out of its costsâ€”roughly 500 jobsâ€”or face the closure of steelmaking at its Port Kembla steelworks. With over 9Â½ thousand people already looking for work in the Illawarra and no obvious plan at the national level for this government to turn that situation around, this round tableâ€”this economic summitâ€”could not have happened at a better time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the summit, my state and federal colleagues put together a plan which looked at state and federal responsibilities and what we needed to do for the sake of the region and to assist the steelworks. Together there were 15 initiatives across all levels of government, which, if put into place, will secure not only the future of the steel industry in the Illawarra but also the future economic base of the region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to say there were representatives there, and I am very pleased to say that the industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, attended the meeting and took a positive attitude. The tone was generally bipartisan. There was not only unanimous support for the long-term viability of steelmaking in the region, something that we understood to be essential to the regional economy, but also a commitment to ensure that we had a long-term diversification of the regional economy. It was agreed that assistance needed to be provided to the workers who are going to lose their jobs and to the small businesses, contractors and suppliers who are going to have their incomes reduced or removed by the changes afoot at BlueScope.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other things need to be done. The week before the summit, the member for Cunningham and I wrote to the Prime Minister with four initiatives that the Commonwealth needs to implement. The first is to beef up the Anti-Dumping Commission, to ensure it is properly resourced to do the job that it was set up by Labor to do. The second is a simple, easily gained initiative: reinstate the local employment coordinator that Labor established in the Illawarra to assist workers and businesses join together those people looking for work and new employment opportunities. The third is to put in place measures that will foster innovation through the local entrepreneur program in ensuring we have somebody on the ground in the Illawarraâ€”not based in Sydney, but in the Illawarraâ€”who knows the local businesses. And the final measure is to ensure we put in place the right labour market and procurement programs to support local industry. If these things are done, there is a future for steel and for the Illawarra. I call on the government to get to and agree to the four-point plan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  Today is R U OK? Day and Suicide Prevention Day. In Australia, there are approximately 2,200 suicides every year, with 80 per cent of them being men. It is a deep societal trend that we view our men as tough and strong; however, depression, a high-risk factor of suicide, does not discriminate and can affect anyone. The feelings of being overwhelmed, irritable and frustrated at the smallest of things; removing yourself from close friends and relying on alcohol to gain an ounce of relief; the ruminating and controlling thoughts like 'I'm a failure' or 'People are better off without me': these are all symptoms of someone who might be depressed, and I know this better than anyone as my husband suffers from depression.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this week I had the pleasure of meeting with Tony Holland, CEO of the OzHelp Foundation. OzHelp is a not-for-profit organisation that provides a number of mental health and wellbeing programs for men in every state and territory across Australia. OzHelp has been running programs and services for men in the Northern Territory since 2008. Last year, the amazing OzHelp staff engaged with an incredible 11,680 men in Darwin, Katherine, Kakadu and Alice Springs. The types of programs and services that OzHelp provide, give men a low-key approach to mental health within the comfort of their workplaces. An example of one of their programs is, as I said yesterday, the Tradies Tune-Up Program. These are 20-minute physical and mental health screens as well as health promotion with a three-month follow-up phone call. The success of this particular program has shown great results. Of those who have taken part: six per cent have quit smoking, 15 per cent have reduced their alcohol intake, 15 per cent were able to confide in a friend or a counsellor about how they were feeling and 43 per cent saw a doctor within three months of their 'tune up'.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Innovative and male-specific programs, like this one run by OzHelp, are the kinds of advancements that Australia needs to help prevent suicide in our hard-working men. If you or anyone that you know is struggling, they are not alone. Help is available. Today, in the spirit of R U OK? Day, pick up the phone or go for a coffee with someone and start a conversation with them. So, Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon, R U OK?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  I rise to speak about the 2015 Noble Park Community Centre Art Show, which I recently had the great pleasure of launching. Noble Park is one of the great communities of metropolitan Melbourne. Unlike many other suburbs in Melbourne's south-east, Noble Park is a long-established community, having celebrated its centenary in 2009. It is a diverse, multicultural and multifaceted community that features some of the great characters of my electorate and is home to many talented artists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Noble Park Community Centre Art Show has become an institution of the Noble Park community, this year celebrating its 10th yearâ€”a fantastic achievement for a show organised by volunteers. I pay tribute to Heather Duggan, the organiser of the Noble Park Community Centre Art Show, and to her committee of hardworking volunteers. I also thank Brian Woodman, the manager of the Noble Park Community Centre, which hosts the show each year, and City of Greater Dandenong councillor Roz Blades, who is a tireless supporter of the show and who attended the launch with me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow minister for the arts, I am privileged to visit many art shows around the country. Call me biased, but there is no event that I enjoy so much as the Noble Park Community Centre Art Show. The show truly represents the artistic expression of the wonderfully vibrant and diverse community of Noble Park. It is an emerging stop on Melbourne's arts calendar and is an opportunity for so many local artists to have their work displayed. I congratulate all artists and the organising committee for their work in making this wonderful event what it is. Communities are held together by volunteers and cultural events. The Noble Park Community Art Show is a key event for the Noble Park community and one that keeps Noble Park the lively, artistic centre that it has become.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Noble Park Community Centre Art Show will be held over the weekend of 10 and 11 October. David O'Halloran, a distinguished curator of some thirty years experience, will be acting as judge of the show. I wish him the best because there will be many artists with strong claims to prizes this year. I encourage all Melbourne residents to put the date in their calendar. If there are any members in the chamber who are interested in viewing some excellent art, I would be more than happy to show them around.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McNAMARA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  Last month I was privileged to attend the foster carers picnic day at Camp Toukley. The day was hosted by the Central Coast out-of-home care interagency network, which represent NGO foster care and adoption services. The day was to acknowledge and celebrate the valuable work of foster carers across the Central Coast. Currently on the Central Coast there are around 82,000 children between zero and 19 years of age. Community Services have 15,000 child protection reports pertaining to these children, and over 4,000 children have been identified as being at significant risk of harm. The day provided much-deserved respite to the carers and the children, with a barbecue hosted by North Lakes Toukley Rotary and plenty of fun activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the day, I met with foster carers and children who shared their personal stories with me. The commitment of the carers to provide the children with a stable, secure and loving environment has a monumental impact on the lives of many children. I witnessed the interaction of many children in care with their foster carers, and the bond between them was so strong. In fact, there was no way of identifying who was a foster child and who was a natural child of the carer. All were relaxed and having fun.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was extremely touched by the dedication of one particular carer, a lady in her 70s caring for a young baby. This beautiful baby looked so peaceful in her stroller, but unfortunately her future does not look bright. She was born to a drug-addicted mother, and this beautiful baby girl has severe brain damage and will not, unfortunately, live a fulfilled, healthy life. Without foster carers to protect and look after vulnerable children in our community, children such as this beautiful baby would never experience the love and security afforded by a caring family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Erin Fidgeon is a 19-year-old and was in foster care for eight years, and I was fortunate to meet Erin and her foster mum, Vicki. Erin is a positive young woman who has not let her early life experiences hold her back. In Erin's own words, when she first entered foster care she was 'a very agitated, angry and hurt child'. It was through the help of her carers that she was given the strength and determination to achieve great things. Erin reflected that having consistency, boundaries and a safe, loving environment are crucial to experiencing the positive changes of being in foster care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I met with Erin, besides being impressed by her positivity, I was informed of some of her achievements. She was vice captain at the Tumbi Umbi campus of Tuggerah Lakes Secondary College, she was runner-up in the TVET School Student of the Year and nominated for the Marie Bashir Award. Erin is now studying to work in the childcare profession. Erin's initial lack of self-confidence when she first entered care is in stark contrast to the confident young woman that I met.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To all the foster carers in our community, I sincerely thank you for the dedication and sacrifices that many of you make to provide a safe, nurturing environment for our most vulnerable children. To each and every one of you: I thank you.</span>

                  <a href="193430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WATTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  On indulgence: last night, the Queen set a record by eclipsing her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, and becoming Britain's longest-serving monarch. As of this morning Queen Elizabeth II has spent 63 years, seven months and four days on the throne. It is a long time, and the Queen has conducted herself with dignity and decency during this time. The Queen is the only ruling monarch to have visited Australia. Our national anthem until 1984, <span style="font-style:italic;">God Save the Queen</span>, prayed for Queen Elizabeth 'long to reign over us' and that she has done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During her reign she has witnessed the coming and going of 12 British prime ministers, 12 Australian Prime Ministers, and 12 American presidents. What she has not witnessed is an Australian head of state. She has witnessed 20 nations gaining independence from Britain, but Australia has not been one of them. To her great credit, the Queen has never denied this to us and after the last referendum on becoming a republic, in 1999, she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have always made it clear that the future of the monarchy in Australia is an issue for you, the Australian people, and you alone, to decide by democratic and constitutional means.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One hundred years ago, when our constitutional and democratic means were being put in place, the British monarch was enshrined as our head of state, in a time when Australia was a very different nation. We were a colonial outpost in a country and in a region that we did not understand and we were not engaging with. Asian Australians who had migrated to Australia had no pathway to citizenship in the Australia of federation. Indigenous Australians, who were here for tens of thousands of years, were not even counted in our census.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the white men who encompassed and comprised the federation parliament, who were required by law to be British subjects to be eligible to sit in that parliament and who joined together in the Melbourne Royal Exhibition Building for that very first sitting, the British monarchy may well have been, in the words of Henry Parkes, the 'crimson thread of kinship' that united them. But even then it did not unite them with Indigenous Australians. Even then it did not unite them with the already-large Chinese Australian community in Little Bourke Street, just five minutes walk away from where they met. It certainly does not unite the diverse, egalitarian nation that we have become today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should say this clearly in this House: the institution of monarchy is wrong. It is un-Australian. It is an affront to the democratic values that brought all of us to this place. It is an affront to the egalitarian values that our nation holds dear. It is exclusive by its very nature and it entrenches the kind of unearned privilege that we seek to roll back in all other aspects of our society. We know this instinctively. We know that the monarchy does not reflect modern Australia. We know this because when we sit at the cricket during the Ashes and the Barmy Army sings 'God save your gracious Queen' they know that it irritates us and they know that it does not reflect us. This is why they do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Australians gathered here today to write their Constitution it would be unfathomable that we would chose a person from another country to be our head of state. We would demand that our head of state be Australianâ€”one of us. We would demand that they be chosen in a way that reflected Australian values. It would be unfathomable to most Australians that we would impose a religious test on eligibility for the position or advantage one gender over another. Yet, only this year, parliament debated the farcical Succession to the Crown Bill 2015 which, among other things, allowed for a future Australian monarch to marry a Catholic and determined that role succession would be determined by birth and not by gender. Suitors of possible future Australian heads of state who are atheist, Buddhist, Hindu or Muslim are still left out in the cold. Australia should be a place where every young boy and girl can aspire to be their nation's head of state. We should be a country where we chose our head of state based on their character and qualifications and their ability to unite us and represent us as a nation, not based on who their parents happen to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queen is a benevolent head of state, and I am genuine in expressing my appreciation for the sacrifices that she has endured after being born into this life. But I am also struck with a feeling of 'what if?'. What if our head of state were one of us? I make no apologies for the pride that I feel in the nation that Australia has become. We are a multicultural, egalitarian and independent nation. We should embrace it and adopt constitutional arrangements that reflect it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate the Queen on reaching this milestone; I wish her and her family good health and thank her for her service. But to put it in Australian terms, 'Well done, Liz, but we can take it from here.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is not about the milestone; it is not about the fact that she has served longer than any other monarch and has served longer than Queen Victoria. I think that what she has done in her lifetime in making that commitment is a value that we could all learn from. Her commitment was that she would reign for as long as she would liveâ€”I am not quite sure of her exact words, but that was her commitment, in effect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a very young child at the time of her coronation, I well remember the celebration across many parts of Australiaâ€”in fact, also being brought in from a country town in western Queensland on a steam train to see Her Majesty at the Brisbane cricket groundâ€”the Gabba today. I think it was in 1956, as she made a visit around many parts of Australia. It was a celebration; it was one of those things that brought our community together. And throughout her life Her Majesty has brought stability to the role of Queen and monarch and also to the role of head-of-state, represented here very well by the Governor General.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queen Elizabeth originally assumed the throne at the age of 25â€”a very young person. She never aspired to become the Queen; it was one of those things that her life course has taken her on. Throughout her reign she has made official visits to 116 countries together with her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, who has also visited my constituency. They have been married for some 68 years. I know that when there is a royal visit to Australia, whether it be by the Queen with her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, or Prince Charles and his wife or the younger royals, it is amazing that those people who say they support a republic are always in the front row. I have witnessed that here recently in Parliament House, with people wanting to get forward and shake the hand of Prince William in the Great Hall. So, they are an inspiration. But I think it is the values and the role that they play and represent that brings so many people together, to want to be associated with the visit and all that it stands for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great things about the Commonwealth, of which she is head, is that under her reign it has gone from a very small organisation to now having representation by 53 Commonwealth countries around the world. The Commonwealth is a great force for good and, once again, I think it is associated with Her Majesty's leadership. The very fact that she is the head of the Commonwealth has brought these countries together not based on ethnicity or geography. I have witnessed many of these meetings over the time, and it is not based on the colour of your skin and it is not based on your religion. They are Commonwealth countries that have the rule of law in a parliamentary system based on the Westminster system but, once again, wanting to associate strongly with the Commonwealth headed by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that I think the Commonwealth has doneâ€”obviously, through Her Majesty's leadership in leading the Commonwealth and bringing it togetherâ€”is the establishment of the Commonwealth Games. The Commonwealth Games bring, once again, the countries of the Commonwealth together to compete on the sporting field on equal terms. In many cases young athletes never achieve the opportunity to compete at the Olympic Games. The Commonwealth Games bring to the sporting field athletes from all walks of life with different religions and backgrounds from countries geographically spread around the world. That is a legacy that I will always look towards and say that it is one of the great strengths of the Commonwealth, along with the great leadership and inspiration that comes from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II for all of us to follow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my constituency, the seat of Maranoa, when there was a referendum to see whether Australia might become a republic it was one of those hotly debated debates. There was a constitutional meeting here in Canberra that brought people together to see what the question should be. The member on my right might have been there or inspired to make a submission as to what form of question we should have. I watched with interest because I thought that, as members, we were going to have to communicate a message to our constituency. I am very pleased that my constituency of Maranoa had the highest no vote for change from the existing system of constitutional monarchy for all that it represents and all the civility that it brings to us. It had the highest no vote in Australia.</span>

I said, 'They voted overwhelmingly no.' He said, 'Well done in the kingdom of Maranoa.' I said, 'Prime Minister, they were well informed.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is more than that. Change for the sake of change means nothing. The stability that we enjoy under the constitutional monarchy, under the Westminster system of parliament, has brought great stability to this nation. It has brought us through turmoil, drought and all sorts of conflicts that we have been involved in around the world. It is the stabilityâ€”the leadership and the inspiration that is taken from that stabilityâ€”that has been provided by Her Majesty, through the Governor-General, through our system of government, that really matters at the end of the day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her Majesty has made a number of trips, and I know of at least one major one to western Queensland for the opening of the Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame in 1988. The people of Longreach still recall that moment. They were not only privileged but also they felt very inspired by the fact that Her Majesty had taken up the invitation and very graciously opened what is a very important part of the history and heritage not only of early settlement in Australia but also of the stockmen and the Aboriginal people and the stories that are told and continue to be told at the Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame.</span>

I can say on behalf of my constituency that I think I reflect their views as well. On behalf of my constituency, congratulations to Her Majesty. We thank you for the magnificent service and inspiration that you give us all. We wish you very good health and long may you reign.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:43</span>):  The moderated hostility of parliament's question time was briefly interrupted yesterday as the Prime Minister moved that the House reflect upon the fact that Queen Elizabeth II, the House of Windsor, the Queen of England and Australia had become our country's longest serving monarch. I pay tribute to the contribution of Queen Elizabeth II, a remarkable public servant, who for 63 years, seven months and four days, I am reliably informed, has out-reigned over all who have come before her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The role of the English royalty in our Constitution and in our public fascination means that she has been a constant feature for all of my life. At school I faithfully sang the words, 'God save our gracious Queen,' as we fulfilled that morning ritual around the school's flagpole.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The song was our national anthem for most of my childhood. Although Gough Whitlam first proposed a change in 1972, it was not until 1984, just months before the Los Angeles Olympics, that <span style="font-style:italic;">Advance Australia Fair</span> replaced the English tune as our national anthem. How strange it must seem today that after beating the British in the stadium we sang their national anthem while our sporting heroes stood there on the Olympic dais.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The path to independence has been a long one. The act of Federation 115 years ago was not an act of independence. For instance, the doctrine of repugnancy, whereby our laws of the Commonwealth parliament could be overruled by the British parliament, survived well into the 20th century. It was no dead letter. There were acts of parliament that were rejected. The Commonwealth parliament's Navigation Act of 1912 was held to be invalid in a 1925 High Court decision because it was inconsistent with an act of the British parliament, the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act of 1894. In 1931 the Statute of Westminster, again an act of the British parliament, finally freed the Commonwealth of Australia from the reach of the repugnancy doctrine. However, there continued to be some uncertainty in respect of the state parliaments. It was not until the 1986 Australia acts when the British and Australian parliaments consecutively legislated to bring an end to the paramount power of the British parliament in respect of Australia. It has been a long march indeed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year we celebrate the centenary of Anzac. One hundred years ago, in the name of king and country and on behalf of empire, we were rallied by our own Labor Prime Minister, Andrew Fisher, to fight to our last man and our last shilling in a European war. They fought in the name of the Australian Imperial Force. There were over 416,000 over them, of which 60,000 were killed and 156,000 wounded, gassed or taken prisoner in a foreign land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I talk about citizenship? The acts of war and terrorism have caused us to contemplate of late the rights and responsibilities of Australian citizenship. It surprises many to learn that in the 115 years of Federation, Australian citizenship is a relatively new arrival. Under the Naturalisation Act of 1903, the Commonwealth government attained the great honour of being able to naturalise aliens, giving them the rights and privileges of British subjects. It was not until 1920 that federal government took effective control and responsibility of selecting who would come to Australia and the circumstances under which they would come, when it gained final control of its migration program. The Nationality Act of 1920 provided clarity by introducing a definition of who was a natural-born British subject.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed it was nearly 50 years since Federation that the notion of Australian citizenship was created through the Nationality and Citizenship Act of 1948, which came into effect a year later. Prior to that date, Australians could only hold the status of British subjects, unless of course you were one of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who had lived continuously practising their culture in this country for over 40,000 years. It was not until 1967 when they were recognised as Australian citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a 20-year hiatus in the march to independence. Over those 20 years, the day-to-day reality of our imperial heritage has waned. In terms of trade we are more integrated into the economies of Asia. In defence and national security our immediate interests lie in the Asia-Pacific region and with those countries for whom that is their No. 1 defence and strategic interest. This is where our future lies. And as we limber up the heated debates about the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, it is worth reflecting upon the observations of former Prime Minister Paul Keating, the architect of our status as an open trading nation and the man who has done more than most to reorientate our national focus with the nations of this region. In 1995 he observed, and I quote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia will be taken more seriously as a player in regional affairs if we are clear about our identity and demonstrate that we really mean to stand on our own feet practically and psychologically.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was true then. It is true today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the turn of the last century a new nation was born. It was crafted in the antipodes from the colonies of Britain. It was as inspired by the democracy in North America as it was loyal to the imperial sovereign. In the 115 years since, we have built one of the most successful, peaceful and wealthy nations on earth. It has not been without fault or cost. For too long we denied the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People. We have not always been good custodians of the land and we persisted with the notion of White Australia long after we knew it was wrong. I remain committed to the ideal of a prosperous, stable, outward-looking democracy reconciled with its Aboriginal people, confident as a new republic but proud of its British ancestry. We do have, within our grasp, the ability to build an economic powerhouse, an open-trading nation that is truly integrated with the nations of this region. But as a republic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those who oppose the dream of an Australian republic it is time for them to be honest. The unadorned core of their refusal is the firm belief that none of usâ€”not one Australianâ€”is good enough to be our Australian head of state. So today I pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth. I hope that she may continue to enjoy a long life and good health and be as well received in the nations of the world as she has been for the last 63 years. But I can no longer stare up at our flag and sing those words, 'Long may she reign over us.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  Today I rise to pay tribute to the reign of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II who, as we know, today has become the longest reigning Britishâ€”and therefore Australianâ€”head of state. It truly is a remarkable record, spanning generations of political leadership, wars and the evolution of the role of Great Britain in the Commonwealth and in world affairs. Throughout, the Queen has kept a relentless schedule of public engagements while demonstrating a dignified, level-headed and subtly effective approach to diplomacy when the times have required it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To put her reign in perspective, consider that the Queen commenced her time on the throne in February 1952. Sir Robert Menzies was just three years into his own record-breaking leadership, leading a Liberal Party less than a decade old. The world was just seven years removed from the Second World War and global leaders were still defined by that conflict. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom was the great Winston Churchill. The President of the United States was Harry Truman. Joseph Stalin was Premier of the Soviet Union and Mao Zedong was Chairman of the Communist Party of China. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among those giants of world history was a 25-year-old Queen Elizabeth II, ascending to the throne on the death of her father, her claim to the Crown only possible due to the abdication of her uncle, Edward VIII, 16 years earlier. Since then, through seven decades, 12 British prime ministers and 13 Australian prime ministers, the Queen has remained a constant in global politics. When you consider how the world has evolved since then, it is possible to grasp the level of wisdom and experience she has gained during her reign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The role of a modern British monarch is a mix of ceremony, politics and diplomacy. During her reign the Queen has certainly demonstrated her unwavering commitment to that role. Since taking the throne the Queen has kept up a brisk pace of public engagement. Even at the age of 89 she keeps a schedule that would tax people half her age. She has given her life to serving the people of Great Britain and the Commonwealth and shows little sign of slowing down.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During her reign, Her Majesty has shown deference to representative politics befitting a modern monarch in a parliamentary democracy. However, in her role as head of state she has, at times, been called upon to participate in political decision making. On two occasions she has been required to appoint a new British Prime Minister on the advice of the cabinet. However, it is in her role in leading and representing the Commonwealth's interests abroad in which she has truly excelled: over the years deftly managing Britain's evolving role in the Commonwealth as they completed their transition from colonial master to ally and partner as their remaining colonies in Africa, South Asia, Oceania and the Caribbean transitioned to independence.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In her first Christmas broadcast the Queen said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">At Christmas our thoughts are always full of our homes and our families. This is the day when members of the same family try to come together, or if separated by distance or events meet in spirit and affection by exchanging greetings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She then went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But we belong, you and I, to a far larger family. We belong, all of us, to the British Commonwealth and Empire, that immense union of nations, with their homes set in all the four corners of the earth. Like our own families, it can be a great power for good - a force which I believe can be of immeasurable benefit to all humanity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That the Queen has remained a revered and beloved figure throughout the Commonwealth over this at times turbulent period is testament to her diplomatic skill, her clear commitment and her ability to command respect and adherence. As a frequent visitor to Commonwealth nations, the Queen has visited Australia 16 times during her reign. There is a genuine affinity and respect for her when she visits us, which seems only to grow with each visit. Indeed, it is the lament of many an Australian republican that Australian voters appear unwilling to part with the monarchy for as long as Elizabeth remains on the throne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a uniquely Australian phenomenon. In the past decade, voters in the Commonwealth nations of St Vincent and the Grenadines and Tuvalu have similarly rejected moves to dispense with the practice of adopting the British monarch as head of state. Much of this respect and affection comes down to her personal style. Queen Elizabeth at all times gives the outward impression of calmness, competence and pragmatism. She has always had a realistic understanding of both the privileges and the limitations on her role as monarch in a modern democratic society. Never has she sought to play an activist role in day-to-day government; however, she has always been willing to offer sound counsel to leaders who have sought it and to represent the interests of Great Britain and the Commonwealth when called upon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this place we know that holding public office is an honour and a privilege, but that it also comes at a cost of increased scrutiny and reduced privacy, so we can only imagine the pressures that come from 63 years at the head of a family that lives very much in the public eye. The Queen has endured family scandal and tragedies often gleefully exposed by a creative and evermore enterprising tabloid media. Throughout, however, the Queen has carried herself with dignity and composure. Whether one is republican, monarchist or ambivalent, Queen Elizabeth's record reign is a remarkable achievement. It is rare indeed for a public figure to be so universally respected and admired, and for Her Majesty to retain the affection of the people after all these years speaks volumes about her qualities as a leader. I add my congratulations to Her Majesty today and wish her good health and good fortune to continue her reign for many years to come.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'NEIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  I rise today to congratulate Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth, who yesterday became the longest-serving British monarch ever. I am a republican, but I never want to overshadow how important the Queen is to the British or how important it is for people who share my beliefs to not be glib or rude about the role of the monarchy. Queen Elizabeth is a public servant; she has lived her entire life in service to her country, and I respect that. Britain is a country that faces many challenges and, frankly, great division. Queen Elizabeth has been a constant, a comfort, a fixture for her people in a very fast-changing world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a very young democracy and today we acknowledge that the Queen has been our head of state for 63 yearsâ€”that is more than half of our life as a federated nation. She is part of our history, and she is always going to be so. But part of our history is where I believe the monarchy should remain. In 1952, when the Queen became our head of state, Australia was a completely different country. We were a monocultural nation where it was deemed perfectly acceptable that we determine our immigration policies based on people's race. New Australians, as they were called, were expected to quickly assimilate into our way of doing things. Our First Australians were, at the time, subject to an extraordinary range of discriminatory policies. In those days a woman's place was in the home, and of all the people who had ever been elected to federal parliament just three of them were women. It was a nation where it made perfect sense that we thought of ourselves as being part of the British Empire. Menzies said that we were, 'British to the bootstraps,' and at the time almost all Australians agreed with him except a ragtag group of radical republicans, of which my grandfather was one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a smaller and younger democracy, things here change very quicklyâ€”much faster than where our Queen lives, over 17,000 kilometres away. Today I represent an electorate where most of the people in it come from migrant families. Almost half of my constituents were born overseas. They come from more than 150 different countries and cultures around the world and for most of them Britain, the Queen and the monarchy have nothing to do with their fiercely Australian identity. The reason for this is very simple and very straightforwardâ€”that is, the values that the incredible people that I represent espouse as Australians have nothing to do with the values that are espoused by the monarchy. The fundamental principle of the monarchy is that power should come from birthright. The monarchy is a sexist institution because the Queen would never have even been the Queen had she had a brother who, just by virtue of being male, would have taken precedence over her right to the throne. In recent years, we have done an incredibly modern thing and updated the laws of succession to allow the eldest child of the royal family to become the king or queen. But discrimination still remains because when Charles becomes king then Camilla will become the queen, but the husband of a future queen will never be a king. The reason for that is very simple: a king is always considered to be more powerful than a queen simply because she is a woman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does not stop there. To become a member of parliament I am not required to join or to be prevented from joining any religious group. Our Constitution declares that there should be no religious test to office and all of us in the chamber would surely agree that the idea of this would be practically and fundamentally ridiculous. It is one of the most basic principles of a secular democracy. But for our head of state, the person who governs over our country, the opposite applies. Due to a recent change, the head of state is, again in an amazing step forward, allowed to marry a Catholic, but they are forbidden from being a Catholic themselves. Within my electorate alone Catholics make up the largest faith community. So 35,000 people that I represent align themselves with that religion, yet that religion is seen by the rules of succession as being so threatening that it would rule any future monarch ineligible. In Hotham there are almost as many Buddhists as there are Anglicans, and non-religious people outnumber Anglicans twofold, but while the recent changes allow a monarch to marry a Catholic when they are crowned, they must still declare that they are a faithful Protestant and in communion with the Church of England. So I say that not only is our head of state and the monarchy unrepresentative of our nationâ€”one of the most multicultural in the worldâ€”but that they also actively discriminate against a large group of people by continuing to preference one religion over another, and one gender over another.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that we simply cannot be the best version of ourselves as Australians until this fundamental building block of our political system is removed. Today, the foundations of our system do not merely fail to reflect who we are as Australians; they reflect values that are anathema to us as Australians: values of hereditary privilege, of discrimination and of exclusion. The notion that this institution is appropriate to preside over this incredible, multicultural, outward looking country, one of the most peaceful and diverse democracies in the world, is wrong. We are big enough to stand on our own two feet and we will be a lot better off for it. Australia is the complete opposite of everything the monarchy represents: we are a young nation, strong, friendly, informal, kind, open and we find titles and pomp and ceremony amusingâ€”something to poke a bit of fun at, not to revere. We love our neighbours no matter what religion, what gender or what sexuality they are. That is what it is to be Australian. Our head of state should be one of us; it is really that simple. We are one Australian people from many different backgrounds and what brings us together, unlike the British, has nothing to do with someone who has visited our country just 16 times over their 60-year reign over us as a people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate the Queen, I really do. She has devoted her life to her kingdom and she will be forever part of our history as Australians, but I do not believe that she should form any part in our future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  I take this opportunity to join with the Prime Minister and my parliamentary colleagues in congratulating Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on reaching a significant milestone in her glorious reign of 63 years and 218 days, surpassing the record set by her great, great grandmother, Queen Victoria. This morning, I had the honour of joining the Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove; church leaders and colleagues at St Paul's Anglican church in Manuka to attend the national ecumenical service to mark the occasion of Her Majesty becoming Britain's longest serving sovereign.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queen is Head of the Commonwealth and Supreme Governor of the Church of England. During her reign, the world has changed remarkably through momentous economic, social and political events; conflicts and international events she has reigned with dignity, integrity and grace. Her devotion to duty and public service is unparalleled. Citizens of Commonwealth nations have enjoyed decades of stability, security, good governance and comparatively high standards of living compared with other nations. Commonwealth countries are united by diplomacy, by international cooperation and through sporting events.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, we celebrate the British heritage of our multicultural nation and all that is good about Australia: our culture, customs and traditions; our system of government; our rule of law; our industrialised economy and our Defence Force. We should be proud of this heritage and never seek to diminish our British heritage from history. We owe our high standard of living and our peaceful and secure society to a stable constitutional monarchy that is built on the British heritage. This fact must never be lost in the national debate on multiculturalism and reconciliation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that there should be mutual respect and recognition of all the cultures on which our nation is founded, without selective omission. The constitutional monarchy is part of our culture. It defines us. We must never downplay the significance of British culture in today's multicultural Australian society. We should celebrate it as an integral part of the pluralistic culture that defines us as modern Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout my lifetime, I have witnessed the Queen's silver, ruby, gold and diamond jubilees. My grandparents instilled in me a healthy respect for our sovereign. I have fond memories of queueing up for hours to see the Queen in public on two occasions: at Perth Airport, when Her Majesty was in Perth, and Government House. I am proud to say that members of my extended family have been loyal servants of the British crown over the generations in the military, clergy and banking. Their distinguished service has been recognised with knighthoods and ennoblements in the baronetage of the United Kingdom of South Hill Park, Broadwell and Filkins.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHAMPION</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wakefield</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  It is a great pleasure to be speaking on our longest serving monarchâ€”63 years, seven months and four days. Queen Elizabeth II has certainly given a great service to the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and Australia. We are very lucky to have a monarch of such good character and of such longevity, and it has given Australia a great sense of stability and certainty as we have gone about our own democracy to have a monarch such as the Queen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the electorate of Wakefield we have a great deal of affection for Queen Elizabeth, because the city at the centre of my electorate, the City of Elizabeth, was named after Her Majesty. I have some affection for that city, having been born in the local hospital. My father came from the United Kingdom and my parents lived there for the first years of their marriage and the first years of my life. So Queen Elizabeth will always have a very special place in my electorate and in the City of Elizabeth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliamentary library was good enough to get this front page from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canberra Times</span>, which records Queen Elizabeth's visit to Elizabeth in 1963. Interestingly enough, the subheading is '500 treated at rallies for Queen' and underneath that is 'Heat tolls'. It must have been a very hot day there in Elizabeth. It does get very warm. There were children from Goolwa, the Barossa Valley and Elizabeth at the Ridley Road reserve waiting for the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. The article talks about 3,000 members of the choir being in a very confined space at the front of the dais and waiting in anticipationâ€”some of them fainting, succumbing to the heat, and ambulance men treating children with aspirin, cool drinks and ice-filled towels. The affection for the Queen was such that people were prepared to put up with a very hot day in South Australia. We do get some scorchers, and the further north you go, the hotter it gets. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This story also talks, very importantly, about the highlight of the visit, which was the unveiling by the Queen of a commemorative fountain on Windsor Green, a three-acre park built by the South Australian Housing Trust. It is very interesting. The history of this park was that it was just next to the council chambers and the Elizabeth shopping centre. People, often, fondly recall to me having had lunch there under the trees and in the park when they were at work or out there shopping. It is a great sadness that this park is now a car park for the shopping centre, covered with bitumen, and now only cars and people race to the shopping centre. Windsor Green is now a distant memory. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interesting enough, the commemorative fountain with the golden tap was lost for many years. The mayor and the City of Playford played some role in finding the fountain. It was found at SA Water, away in storage. They were desperately trying to get this fountain reinstalled in an appropriate place in what is now the city of Playfordâ€”it was the City of Elizabethâ€”so the Queen could return to reopen the fountain, which she opened in 1963. Sadly, they could not get the building and construction in place in time for the most recent visit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It tells you a lot about not just the history of my electorate but the history of Australia and the history of the Queen's long reign as our constitutional monarch. I am a republican, but I do recognise that this long period of certainty and stability in our constitutional affairs is something to be treasured and admired. It is, in many ways, a tribute to the character of the Queen herself. These are human affairs, monarchies and governance around the world, and so they rely on people being of good character and good judgement. We have been very fortunate in Queen Elizabeth II to find that good character and good judgement. We can only hope that future presidents of Australia look to her as a guide on how to undertake their roles, with an eye to stability and certainty in our constitutional affairs and in the role of head of state of our nation. With that, I would like to echo the previous member, the member for Moore, and say God save the Queen and long may she reign over us.</span>

                  <a href="HYM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IRONS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  I too rise to say a few words on this occasion of Her Majesty the Queen surpassing Queen Victoria and becoming the longest-reigning monarch of the UK, and obviously of Australia as well. It was interesting to hear the contribution of the previous speaker, the member for Wakefield. I am sure he knows that his electorate voted very strongly against becoming a republic, so I am sure he will continue to represent the views of his electorate in this place whenever the subject of a republic comes up. It was good to see him holding up a newspaper as well; he has done some research. And, obviously, he said some kind words about the Queen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queen's reign has now reached 63 years, seven months and two days. Most of us in this House have known no other monarch in our lives, although there are a couple of exceptionsâ€”I will not mention their names! What I can say though is that there is no member in this place that could come close to matching the 63 years of public service that the Queen has clocked up. The Queen famously once said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is a motto which has been borne by many of my ancestors, a noble motto, 'I serve'. I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service â€¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That she meant these words has never been in any doubt. In fact only yesterday, on the day she overtook Queen Victoria, while acknowledging the milestone she also said that she considered it 'the same as any other day, a working day'. As we heard from the member for Throsby earlier, I also have memories of singing <span style="font-style:italic;">God save the Queen</span> every Monday morning in the schoolyard around the flagpole. I also remember her visiting Victoria while I was still a child. I have very fond memories of that. Both of my foster parents were strong monarchists. Although they originally came from South Africa, they were enthralled by the monarchy, what it stood for and how it reigned over not only the UK and Australia but also the many other Commonwealth nations around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In WA the Queen enjoys extremely high levels of public support. There was only one electorate in the whole of Western Australia that supported the vote on the republic back in the late nineties, and that was, would you believe, the most conservative of our seats in Western Australiaâ€”the seat of Curtin! Yesterday's newspaper, the commemorative edition of the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australia</span>n, was entitled 'Glorious reign' and included eight pages celebrating the Queen's reign, which is indicative of the extremely high levels of public support for the Queen in Western Australia. As we know, there is a major infrastructure project happening down on the river, near the CBD, which will be named Elizabeth Quay, obviously after Queen Elizabeth. I know the state's Premier was very proud in making that one of his captain's picks, but I am sure it will be a good tribute to the Queen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were some great photos and images in the paper yesterday from across the Queen's reign, including her visit to Clontarf academy in my electorate on 27 October 2011. Clontarf, as many members would be aware, is based in Waterford and is a highly successful sporting academy for Indigenous students. As the member for Swan, I was fortunate enough to attend this event and see at close range the magic touch the Queen has with the people of Australia. The purpose of the Queen's visit to Clontarf was to officially open a new boarding house at the school. While the ceremony was performed extremely well, it was what came after the ceremony that was indicative of and epitomised everything that is good about the Queen. Instead of leaving immediately after the ceremony, the Queen spent a generous amount of time with the students at the school watching football and basketball games, sitting in on a reading and visiting a home economics class where the students were making kangaroo stew. Whether she actually tasted the kangaroo stew or not, I am not sure. I am sure that they will never forget meeting the Queen, just as the many thousands of people she has met around the world will never forget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the opportunity to be near the Queen when she was at the garden party that was held in Perth in recognition of her visit in 2011. It was great to see so many school children there. The Queen went out of her way to spend time with them. She spent more time with them than with the adults at the garden party! On a personal note, I wrote to both the Premier and the Prime Minister's office at the time to ask whether, I could be part of the welcoming party for the Queen when she landed at Perth Airport, which is in my electorate. Unfortunately I got a negative from both the Premier's office and the Prime Minister's office. But some wag leaked the letter to the newspapers and I now have a great cartoon from <span style="font-style:italic;">The West Australian</span> newspaper that shows me being escorted away from Buckingham Palace, which I now hang proudly in my office. As I said, those kids will never forget meeting the Queen, as I am sure we have seen with her other visits around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also spoken about the 1999 republic referendum. In my electorate of Swan we voted no. The margin, coincidentally, was the same as my current 2PP margin. I am hoping that my constituents still represents those views, and I will continue to represent their views on this matter as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the success of the Queen's reign has been the constancy she has shown and also how she has moved with the times. She seems as at home today in a sea of iPhones as she did on the back of the jeep at Forest Oval in York in 1954. Of course, the Duke has always been by her side. Congratulations to Queen Elizabeth II on her reign. I am sure she will have many more days and many more records to break. Well done to Queen Elizabeth for her service to her country and to the Commonwealth.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to join in this motion and congratulate the wonderful achievement of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on becoming the longest-serving English monarchâ€”with a term of 63 years and seven months, or 23,226 days. During that time, we have seen our Queen provide continuity and stability. She has done so with grace, dignity and decency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a good opportunity the reflect on how successful a constitutional monarchy has been for our nation. We have seen perhaps a million migrants come to this country from failed republics, and one of the reasons they have come is for the continuity and stability that a constitutional monarchy provides to our nation. Ultimately, the only power that the Queen has in Australia is to deny power to others. That is why our system of constitutional monarchy worksâ€”because it prevents a concentration of power at any one level of our society. There are some who still rabbit on about the need for a republic. For 20 years they have talked about it but they are yet to come up with any model that even comes close to our constitutional monarchy. Their latest argument is that we should agree to have some form of republic and a group of elites will at some time down the track work it all out for usâ€”we will give them a blank cheque and they will fill in what the republic is. The simple reason they cannot come up with a better model is that no-one has yet invented one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea of saying yes when asked whether we want a republic and having some group work out what type of republic they will give us is analogous to being asked whether we would like to go on a holiday but not being told where to. Yes; everyone would like to go on a holiday. But if I told you that you were going to go to perhaps Raqqa or Pyongyang you might think again. Likewise, unless they can come up with a model of a republic that they consider is better than our current constitutional monarchy, it should simply be rejected. Long may Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II continue to reign over us.</span>

The <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Advertiser</span> produced a special edition on the occasion with the headline, 'Wagga's greatest day'â€”indeed it was. It remains so, for our young monarch spent 145 minutes in town. The population of the city was then about 8,000 and yet 18,000 turned out to throng the streets lined with bunting. Flags were waved proudly, school children were there in their masses, and it was just, as I said, Wagga's greatest day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prince Charles and Princess Diana spent time at Woomargama, just down the road from Wagga Wagga, when they visited in 1983. There were obviously some important close connections with the earlier visit by Queen Elizabeth II. I have to give credit to Rhonda Schippâ€”wife of the former member for Wagga Wagga Joe Schipp, a Liberalâ€”who maintains a very strong and proactive role in the Australians for Constitutional Monarchy in Wagga Wagga. When the recent debate, the perennial debate, occurred about whether Australia should become a republic, Mrs Schipp came out swinging, as you would expect her to. She said that she believes our current system with the Queen as our head of state provides the nation with a platform of stability. And indeed it does.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queen Elizabeth II has surpassed Queen Victoria as history's longest reigning monarchâ€”as the British Empire's longest reigning monarch. When you can reign for 63 years and seven months in public lifeâ€”that is truly an extraordinary effort. We have much to praise with our Queens, certainly Queen Elizabeth II. Queen Victoria had two Australian states named after her, Victoria and Queensland. She reigned from 1837 until her death in 1901. Her husband, Prince Albert, who died at a very young age, had Lake Albert in Wagga Wagga named after him. It was built in the 1890s. He died in 1861. From his death until her death, Queen Victoria dressed in black, in mourning, and was rarely seen in London.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our current Queen certainly is far more colourful. Her grace, her elegance and her presence are to be admired. She has certainly led the Commonwealth superbly for more than six decades. I am sure that all Australians join with members of parliament in acknowledging her wonderful leadership and her wonderful role in public life. It is interesting to note that, amongst the clamour of calls for a republic, whenever the Queen visits or whenever we have a royal visit, particularly to Parliament House, the first ones jostling to get in line to get a photoâ€”the first ones falling over themselves and pushing the monarchists out of the wayâ€”are the republicans. It is truly amazing. They love her. We all love her. We all love the royals. The Queen has given sterling service. May she long reign over us.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="137174" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NIKOLIC</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I congratulate the member for Riverina, the member for Swan and others on their excellent contributions. It is little wonder that members on both sides of the House join the Australian people in acknowledging the extraordinary contribution of Her Majesty the Queen and particularly the milestone she achieved yesterday, 9 September, in relation to her historic reign. Yesterday, Her Majesty became the longest serving monarch in British history, surpassing her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria, who sat on the throne for 63 years and 216 days. What an extraordinary achievement over six decades of selfless service. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's constitutional arrangements established on 1 January 1901 describe the parliament as encompassing three parts: the Queen, the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Queen then was Queen Victoria who, until yesterday, held the distinction of longest reigning British monarch. Her great-great-granddaughter is Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and who can ever forget the difficult circumstances of her ascension to the throne? King George VI, the Queen's father, died in his sleep in the early hours of 6 February 1952. He was also the last Emperor of India and the first head of the Commonwealth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The then Princess Elizabeth, accompanied by her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, were travelling to Australia. It is characteristic of the Queen's adherence to the motto 'duty first' that her first response to being advised of the death of her beloved father was to write letters of apology to the governments of Australia and New Zealand that her imminent visit would be postponed. That sense of duty above self has endured and is the hallmark of the Queen's reign, who has been supported at every step by her husband, Prince Philip. The principles of duty and hard work have been her North Star all of these decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As monarch, the Queen has consistently demonstrated her love of Australia and our interests. The member for Riverina and others have talked about her many visits to Australia during her long reign, which have always been received with enormous affection and respect. It is remarkable when you think the Queen has known and advised 12 prime ministers, from Sir Robert Menzies to the present day, and she has always taken her constitutional rights very seriously. They are, of course, the right to be consulted, the right to encourage and the right to warn. In 63 years the Queen has never betrayed a confidence given to her, by any of those prime ministers, in any of her realms. She has not played personal politics, and yet anything politically done is done in her name. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to have worn the Queen's commission, as an officer of the Australian Regular Army, for 31 years, first as a soldier and then as second lieutenant and through to brigadier and, particularly, as a nine-year veteran of the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment. Indeed, all members of the armed services in the 16 realms hold the Queen's commission. They swear a pledge of allegiance to the Queen and her heirs and successors, according to law. I notice that hanging on my wall in Parliament House is my own oath of allegiance on 16 January 1979. I pledged allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, the Queen of Australia, her heirs and successors and undertook to 'loyally and faithfully serve Her Majesty as a soldier in the Australian Army' at that stage for a period of six years or until such time as my service was lawfully terminated and to discharge all of the duties of a soldier, 'according to law'. That pledge was taken by Captain RA Snuggs at the Defence Force Recruiting Centre, in Adelaide, on 16 January 1979. It is an important distinction, in our parliamentary democracies, that our military personnel have a duty to the sovereign, and the directions they get from the government of the day must be lawful and in her name.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth noting another important role held by the Queen. Since 1952 she has also been head of the Commonwealth. I mentioned earlier that her father was the first head of the Commonwealth. It is an independent association of 53 states, many of which have their own monarchies or are republics, but all honour Queen Elizabeth as the head of the Commonwealth. Our Queen, all these decades later, still puts service ahead of self for 364 days out of each and every year. Daily, Her Majesty dutifully deals with official papers from the British government and from the governments of Australia and the other 14 countries of which she is head of state. Indeed, she only gives herself Christmas Day off. The royal engagements are unceasing and Her Majesty continues to apply herself to them with gusto. It is worth noting the current generation of the royal family. I will quote from her grandson Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, who praised his grandmother recently. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ I am privileged to witness the private side of the Queen as a grandmother and a great-grandmother. The Queen's kindness â€¦ her innate sense of calm and perspective, and her love of family and home are all attributes I experience first-hand. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He goes on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">All of us who will inherit the legacy of my grandmother's reign and generation need to do all we can to celebrate and learn from her story. Speaking for myself, I am privileged to have the Queen as a model for a life of service to the public. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just say in concluding: well said, Prince William. Many of us in Australia join you in paying tribute to the Queen of Australia and thank Her Majesty for her record of duty and service.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  Last weekend, most MPs probably went to a best and fairest night for a local football team or a local netball team. In regional Victoria we have been holding several of them. Last week, as the No. 1 ticket holder for the Bendigo Thunder Women's Football Club, I got the chance to pop along to congratulate the girls on a great season. At the event, I got to catch up with lots of the players and just chat to them about what they are doing off the field as well as on the field, and I met a remarkable woman whose story continues to inspire me. She is studying at La Trobe Uni. She is studying for a teaching degree and is moving into her final years, having just completed her placement. She is a fantastic football player, a great community asset and an important person within the club and also works casually for KR Castlemaine, or DON-KR. They are a smallgoods food producer in Castlemaine. They employ quite a few people, including a number of students like this remarkable young woman, on a casual basis. These shifts help them pay for their studies, help them pay their rent and help them buy their textbooks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But she, like many of the young students and casual workers at KR Castlemaine, has recently lost her shifts. Every week she diligently calls her supervisor to say, 'Is there work available this week?' and the company says, 'No, there are no shifts available.' That is because the company has taken the extraordinary step since before Christmas of using a labour hire firm that hires people here on temporary work visasâ€”the 417 backpacker visa. So you can imagine the frustration of this amazing young woman studying and working to get towards the end of her degreeâ€”the frustration that she is losing work to other young people that are here on the backpacker visa. Why? The overseas workers working for the labour hire firm are about $4 an hour cheaper. That is one of the rates. On other rates, they are $7 an hour cheaper. The company has chosen not to back and support local workers but instead has gone for the cheaper alternative: using a labour hire firm that has overseas Taiwanese and Vietnamese temporary workers here on the backpacking visa.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To make matters worse, the company are still advertising for staff. They still have the ads up on seek.com; they still have the ads in the local paper. They are putting false hope out there to other local people who may be looking for work. Some of the people who have applied for jobs have contacted me since this story broke in our local papers before Christmas and said: 'I applied for a job and was told I was unsuccessful before I even got to the interview stage.' Others who have been through the interview stage have then received the generic 'unsuccessful'. Yet we know from the company's admission that they are still engaging between 100 and 150 temporary workers, who are in Australia on a backpacker visa, on a daily and weekly basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a stand-alone case. There is a problem with the structure of the working holiday visa in this country. Time and time again we are learning that local kids, local young people, are missing out on work opportunities, on jobs and on casual hours to overseas temporary workers. The subcontractor may be paying people the award, but it is wrong to use the award to undercut the collective agreement that has been bargained in good faith in this one particular worksite. It is wrong when two workers who are standing side by side doing the exact same work get paid differentlyâ€”one is paid less than the other because of who they are employed by.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must act to help clean up this. It is not fair that the overseas workers are (a) being exploited and (b) being used to undercut collective agreements, local wages and conditions that have been negotiated in good faith. It is time this government started to put local young people first. We want to see locals get these job opportunities first before companies look to the overseas workers. It is not fair and it is not right. To local people looking for work: keep looking and keep speaking up because we on this side of the House will not abandon you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  Last night I had the great pleasure of attending the annual Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation's Rural Women's Award in the Great Hall, which celebrates women in agriculture. It is an event where state finalists of the award come together to be judged to find an eventual winner. It is a fantastic event. We were addressed by last year's winner, Pip Job, from New South Wales. Pip reflected on her year's experience and her project, which was about women's involvement in the landscape and being very much in touch with sustainable management of our land mass and our production. We were also addressed by Minister Barnaby Joyce. He provided a very entertaining speech where he challenged us all to see how we could get more women in this place and involved in mainstream politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we had the introduction of the state finalists: from the Northern Territory, Dr Sally Isberg; from New South Wales, Cindy Cassidy; from Queensland, Sherrill Stivano; from Victoria, Katie Finlay; from Western Australia, Tress Walmsley; and from Tasmania, Carol Bracken. Carol was named as the runner-up for the award. She is a hazelnut grower from Glengarry in the Tamar Valley. The farm was established just five years ago and the family has now over 5,000 trees. Carol and her husband are instrumental in growing the hazelnut industry in Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From my point of view, at least, we saved the best for last. I speak about the South Australian finalist, Sarah Powell, who was named Australia's Rural Woman of the Year. For me this was especially rewarding because Sarah comes from a very small town, Darke Peak, which is close to where I live. That is where she was raised on a family farm. The family, unfortunately, lost control of the farm with the high interest rates during the 1980s. Her father moved into Ozbulk, and she spent some time then in my home town, growing up in Kimba, and her first employment was there. Later on her family moved to the Riverland and then eventually to Queensland where she took on a range of jobs including being CEO of one of the regional development boards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sarah had a very interesting and varied career. Then she came back to her hometownâ€”she came back on a visitâ€”and she was depressed by what had happened to so many of the communities she grew up in. What had happened to the schools? What had happened to the shops? They were gone. What had happened to the local football clubs? Amalgamated. Sarah met the love of her life there, and a family will be on the way soon with her partner, Caleb, but she decided to take the situation in hand. She recognises that even now the sporting clubs that remain in these country communities are the most strongly structured institutions in those communities and have the most ability to bring people towards them to work for the common good within their community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With that, she launched Ports academy, and that was the project which won her the state award. She brings together a number of nominated young people within the district, and they receive a number of sessions with local mentors and some sporting mentors, to build their capacity to be future leaders within their community. It is a great project, and I am very proud of what she does.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the things Sarah raises, though, some of the issues there, are very salient points for all of us who represent rural Australia. She made the point, in fact, the night before. We had dinner with a young fellow who plays football in north-eastern Victoria. They were in the process of amalgamating the last of the teams in their league to become one club and then go on and join the next league, as happens in rural Australia all over the place. They had a count-up: 50 years ago there were 58 clubs, now there is one. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the story of rural Australia, and how we reinvigorate our industries. Every year, I repeatedly say, Australian farmers will grow more food, more fibre. They will grow it at a better quality and it will be a great outcome for Australia. It will be a great outcome, in my case, for South Australia. It is quite good for the farmers still involved. But it is an absolute disaster for the local communities, as we see our populations empty out. How we find new industries, how we attract new people into these towns, is the great conundrum for all of us. I would just like this parliament be aware of it, and I congratulate Sarah Powell on her fantastic victory.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I rise to voice the concerns of the Maltese community I represent, and the wider Maltese community throughout Australia, regarding the cuts to SBS Maltese language services. I am privileged to represent a large Maltese community in this place, and I have worked with that community in the past to ensure they have access to appropriate levels of Maltese content on the Special Broadcasting Service. This community relies heavily on the vitally important language services SBS provides, and the community has made it clear that they want these services to be maintained. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Maltese community has a large older population that relies on language services, as often their English language proficiency is not very high. This demand for Maltese language content is not helped by the comparative limited availability of Maltese community news outlets in Australia. SBS provides one of the few language services that broadcast such vital community information.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the vice-president of the Maltese Community Council of New South Wales, Mr<span style="background-color:#FFFFFF;&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Arial;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;    color:#545454;&#xD;&#xA;  "></span>Emanuel Camilleri, has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Maltese community is getting older, and as there are not newspapers anymore, radio is the only avenue of news and communication they have left.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is therefore extremely disappointing that due to the Abbot government's broken promises and funding cuts to the SBS, the number of hours dedicated to Maltese language services has been reduced. SBS has announced that the digital-only Maltese programs will be cut. Overall, this will see a reduction in content from four hours per week to two. Understandably, the Maltese community is very disappointed with this decision. One of the few Maltese community publications, <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> V</span><span style="font-style:italic;">oice of the</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Maltese</span>, co-edited by Mr Lawrence Dimech and Mr Joseph Cutajar, recently editorialised:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Without giving a reasonable excuse why they want to discontinue two hours from the existing four allocated to the Maltese community, SBS Radio once again has disregarded the needs of our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Maltese Community Council of New South Wales and the Maltese Community Council of Victoria have also protested against this decision, and I have been very willing to support their submission to the SBS to reverse these changes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I intend to table the signatures of hundreds of Maltese community members who want these hours reinstated for Maltese community language programs. The community is speaking with a united voice that these are retrograde changes that will have an adverse impact on the community. I did write to the managing director of SBS, Mr Michael Ebeid, on behalf of the Maltese Community Council of New South Wales, earlier this year, and I appreciate Mr Ebeid taking the time to respond. In his correspondence dated 5 August Mr Ebeid says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are unable to extend this two year period of additional digital only programming, as SBS's funding situation has worsened in the two years since this announcement with a further $55 million cut from the government in late 2014.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the $55 million cut to the SBS that the Prime Minister expressly ruled out the night before the 2013 election in that now infamous interview in Penrith with SBS's Anton Enus in which the now Prime Minister looked down the barrel of a camera and promised:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">No cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the words that will hang like an albatross around this Prime Minister's neck all the way up to the next election. This government was elected on a clear platform of no cuts to the SBS and instead it has delivered millions of dollars worth of cuts that have hit content and have greatly adversely impacted on the Australian community, as these hundreds of signatures will attest. This is a complete and utter betrayal of the Maltese community, which relies on these services. I urge this government to reverse its cuts to the SBS. I table these signatures from the Maltese community.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  Students, parents, teachers and other interested community members from across the mid-North Coast had the opportunity to put forward their ideas on how the Commonwealth government can better support local students in gaining a university degree. Recently I had the Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and Employment, Senator Bridget McKenzie, in the electorate of Lyne. We met with representatives from the departments of education and social services and hosted the regional higher education forum in Taree. We had a very good attendance of over 20 people, including aspiring students and their parents, as well as school leadersâ€”namely, principalsâ€”career advisers, university members and general community members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The interim report that the committee has put together already has found that regional and remote students face additional barriers to accessing higher educationâ€”namely, costs, distance from education, their school experiences and aspirations and their preparedness, as well as the challenges of individual socioeconomic status.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Postcode should not determine whether a young person can secure a university place at the university of their choice. Young people from regional and remote communities make up 27 per cent of Australia's population, yet they only represent just over 20 per cent of Australia's university population. That simply is not good enough. Securing a university degree is important to any young person because graduates earn, on average, 75 per cent more over the life of their careers. It is also vitally important for regional and remote communities to have doctors, dentists, lawyers, accountants, journalists, teachers, engineers and computer programmers because all of these services and skills are needed as much in the regions as they are in the metropolitan centres. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the biggest barriers that we found to a studentâ€”or your childâ€”securing a university degree from where the degree is being delivered is cost. I am not talking about the HECS debt. The greatest barrier for regional and remote students is the cost of relocating for study. This is officially estimated at $15,000 to $20,000, but the consensus of all the representatives is that it is more like $25,000 or $30,000, particularly if you are studying at a metropolitan universityâ€”with rents between $250 and $400 per week, just in share houses with more people than there are bedrooms. It is very expensive to exist, as anyone knows, in a metropolitan centreâ€”let alone for a student.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These significant cost burdens are not faced by people who are blessed with a postcode of birth and a family located near the university they want to attend. Hallelujah! It is a lot easier for them, but if you are coming from Bourke, Brewarrina or Lismore to Sydney, or from Ballarat to Melbourne, you cannot catch a bus. You cannot use your Opal card to get to uni. You have to move lock, stock and barrel.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some support programs available which are very helpful. Youth allowance and relocation and start-up grants are helpful, but there are many families who earn above the threshold who are not wealthy families but do not qualify for anything, and they are left to foot the bill. For a local family with two or more students wanting to access higher education, this can add up to almost $50,000 in after-tax earnings, which for two salaried people, in a town like the one I live in, is absolutely out of reach. They get hammered with the cost, but they are excluded on the current criteria, and the independence criteria for their child to achieve independence and get youth allowance are tilted against that happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank all the participants who took part in the forum and who shared their stories and their ideas. The contribution will help shape a final report which will be presented to the Minister for Education, Christopher Pyne, and the Minister for Social Services, Scott Morrison, later this year. I am sure there are going to be very many good recommendations out of the report, because we certainly know what the problem is and we will continue to fight for a better outcome for regional and remote students.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:56</span>):  Before the last election, the member for Warringah promised that if he won government the economy would receive an adrenaline surge. I am not a doctor, but I do know a little bit about adrenaline. Most people know that it is a bodily reaction to fight or flight. It either gives you the energy to fight or it gives you the energy to run away. But adrenaline can also do something else, sadly. I know this from my partner who has worked in child protection for 23 years. Adrenaline can actually freeze you as well. When people are incredibly scared, they actually get a surge of adrenaline and can be frozen on the spot. Unfortunately, child abuse victims often talk about thatâ€”the fact that they were frozen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the sort of adrenaline that has hit the Australian economy. It is frozen and it is getting worse. When Labor was in government growth was at 2.5 per cent, and now growth is at 0.2 per cent in the latest figures that came out this week. Under the Labor government there was a budget deficit of $30 billion, and it is now nearly $50 billion. On government debt, we were told by the member for North Sydney that there would be a surplus in his first year, yet government debt is now out to $114 billion, with another $2 billion borrowed this week. Business investment is down 11 per cent. Real wages, throughout Australia, are actually falling. Unemployment, when Labor was in office, was at 5.7 per cent and it is now 6.3 per centâ€”800,000 Australians out of work. That is a massive number. Let's put it in context: all of Tasmania has 515,000, and if you count every person in the Northern Territory that is 234,000. So if you take every single person in Tasmania and every single person in the Northern Territory and then throw in a couple of other territories as well, like Norfolk Island and the like, you still do not get to 800,000. We know what that means if the household does not have employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Have the Liberal and National parties, supposedly the economic managers, been cutting taxes across the nation? Well, let's look at that. The tax-to-GDP ratio has actually increased under the coalition government. They said that they were going to be a low-taxing government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We remember those famous words delivered at Penrith by the member for Warringah the night before the election, where he said there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS. It turned out to be a to-do list, that supposed promise to the people of Australia. In terms of flagging a 50 per cent increase in the GST, going from 10 per cent up to 15 per cent, it would especially impact on poorer households.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The supposed economic wonder child that talked up his credentials before the election has turned out to have wreaked havoc across the economy. It will take years to turn around the economy due to the way it has been mishandled. They have focused on things like giving a knighthood to the Queen's husband, as if that is a priority. It is unbelievable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a government that seems to be frozen in place, where the economy is going backwards, but it does not have the ability to talk to the Australian people or to talk to Australian businesses. And now, unbelievably, it has picked an argument with small businesses. I have 19,000 small businesses in my electorate. The government has now picked an argument with COSBOA because of its broken promise on the effects test. It is unbelievable to think that everything touched by this government, in just two years in office, could have such a devastating effect on Australia, especially on our economy, as well as creating division in Australian society.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249758" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLIAMS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  Yesterday's announcement that Australia will take on an additional 12,000 refugees from the crisis in Syria and Iraq is great news. I congratulate the Prime Minister and the government as Australia increases our commitment to those who have been or are being persecuted for their religious beliefs. The 12,000 refugees announced are on top of the 13,750 refugees that Australia takes each and every year. The number of refugees will increase to 18,750 in 2018-19. Only last year the government took 4,400 refugees from the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that Australia has secure boarders allows us greater flexibility in determining who are most in need of asylum. Our officials will work with the UNHCR to resettle the refugees as soon as possible. These people are escaping the horrors that Daesh has unleashed against the Middle East region. The program will focus on women, children and persecuted minorities. I know the support announced by the government will be well supported by the Australian people. It is a compassionate and measured response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The move by the government to increase humanitarian migration has created a lot of discussion out there with the public about the benefits or otherwise of migration. I wanted to take this opportunity to outline some of the economic benefits that can come from an increase in migration and the need of my home state of South Australia for economic stimuli.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A report released last week by the Australian Bureau of Statistics stated that migrants have generated $38 billion in total income in recent years. More directly to the refugees that are bound for Australia, the report stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Humanitarian migrants displayed greater entrepreneurial qualities and reported a higher proportion of income from their own unincorporated businesses and this income increased sharply after five years of residency.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November 2013, the ABS released a survey on the characteristics of recent migrants. Of those who obtained Australian citizenship since arrival, the labour participation rate was 77 per cent, which is above the national average rate of about 65 per cent. Claims that migrants are a net pressure on welfare payments do not stack up. Migrants are likely to be working.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The New South Wales government has done some research on the benefits of migration on the economy. Its report found that migration has boosted the economic performance of Australia and noted 'the personal characteristics and social factors that have facilitated "exceptional" business performance by many Australian migrants'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to refer to another report. A recent study by AMES and Deloitte Access Economics has shown that since 2010 approximately 160 refugees have resettled in Nhill in north-western Victoria. More than 70 full-time equivalent positions were added to the regional economy over the five-year period of analysis, representing three per cent of total employment across the area. The economic impact of this is estimated to be over $40 million in net present value terms. That is a fantastic outcome for a regional community that has been able to resettle refugees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been said that the movement of refugees from Syria is the largest since World War II, and this is a crisis that Australia has responded to. During our history there have been several high-profile examples of people fleeing to Australia, sometimes with little more than the clothes on their back. Frank Lowy, the founder of the Westfield shopping centres, is a prominent Australian who is one of many who were persecuted during World War II. He arrived in Australian in 1952 penniless to be reunited with his mother, but he has gone on to make a significant contribution to our country, not just in business but also as the Chairman of the Football Federation Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have found numerous reports of how migration helps economies to grow and, while there are always challenges, this is overwhelmingly a benefit to our nation. One report that I would like to highlight in closing is the 2007 report from the Department of Social Services which said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The main conclusion to be drawn from this study is that the social benefits of migration far outweigh the cost, especially in the longer term. The evidence that is available overwhelmingly supports the view that migrants to Australia have made and continue to make substantial contributions to Australia's stock of human, social and produced capital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of South Australia, we need as much help as we can get with our economy, and the Premier has come out with his own support for resettlement of refugees in South Australia. This can only help our economy. The Commonwealth government regularly provides support for resettlement and will ensure that the refugees are given the opportunity to succeed and thrive in our great land.</span>
