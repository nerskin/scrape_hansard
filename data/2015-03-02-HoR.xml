            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government strongly disagrees with boycott movements that seek to ban exchanges with Israel, impede legitimate trade between states, and unfairly target Australian businesses.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">At this critical juncture, the international community should be focused on encouraging all parties to return to negotiations towards a two-state solution, with Israel and a Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace and security, within internationally recognised borders. The BDS campaign against Israel, in addition to harming the Palestinian people economically, undermines these efforts.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your letter of 24 November 2014 concerning a petition received by the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding climate change emissions targets.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to its unconditional target to reduce emissions by 5 per cent below 2000 levels by 2020. This target represents a substantial effort â the Government's modelling indicates that business-as-usual emissions will reach 17 per cent above.2000 levels by 2020. On a range of indicators, Australia's 5 per cent target is comparable with most other advanced economies. The Government will track progress towards Australia's target through its national emissions inventory.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's priority is to implement its Direct Action plan â with the Emissions Reduction Fund as the key element to deliver on this 5 per cent commitment. The Government will review Australia's international targets in 2015. The review will focus on the extent to which other nations, including the major economies and Australia's major trading partners, are taking real and comparable actions to reduce emissions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Emissions Reduction Fund will provide incentives for cleaning up our environment through activities in Australia such as revegetation, investing in soil carbon, cleaning up power stations, capturing gas from landfill and increased energy efficiency. The Senate passed legislation to put in place the Emissions Reduction Fund on 31 October 2014, and the House of Representatives passed the legislation on 24 November 2014. Unlike the carbon tax â a Government imposition that penalises the nation as a whole â the Emissions Reduction Fund is a market mechanism that will allow Australia's emissions target to be met at the lowest cost to the economy and the community. In addition, the Government will provide targeted funding to support the uptake of solar energy and the revegetation of land through the 20 Million Trees programme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's approach to climate change is to focus on practical responses which provide positive local environmental outcomes.</span>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 2 December 2014 regarding a recently submitted petition on China's actions in the South China Sea.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is concerned by recent developments in the South China Sea because of our strong interests in the maintenance of peace and stability, unimpeded trade and freedom of navigation and our respect for international law. Australia does not, however, take a position on the merits of competing claims in the South China Sea.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">South China Sea disputes must be resolved peacefully and all dispute resolution options - including arbitration - should be considered. The Government urges all parties to exercise restraint, take steps to ease tensions and refrain from provocative actions. Australia opposes the use of intimidation, aggression or coercion to advance any country's claims or unilaterally alter the status quo.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia urges governments to pursue their claims in accordance with international law, including the <span style="font-style:italic;">United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</span>. The Government encourages practical implementation of commitments under the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, including on self-restraint. We continue to urge China and ASEAN member countries to make early progress on a substantive Code of Conduct for the South China Sea.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 27 November 2014 regarding a petition submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding the East West Link.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government committed to the East West Link because of the transformative positive impacts it would make to the Australian and Victorian economies. It had the potential to address Melbourne's current transport challenges, improve accessibility to important economic and employment centres across the city and create an immediate boost to the economy through its job creation potential.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is keen to ensure that important nationally significant projects proceed such as those which were in the Victorian Infrastructure Investment Programme. We will work collaboratively with the new Victorian Government to agree infrastructure priorities that are in the best interests of the Victorian and Australian economies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Dr Jensen</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 30 October 2014 to the then Minister for Social Services, the Hon Kevin Andrews MP, regarding a petition from the Casey Cardinia Community Legal Service (reference number 960/1430). Your letter has been referred to me for response as it relates to a matter within my portfolio.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition relates to the cancellation, with effect from 30 June 2015, of additional funding allocated by the previous government to the Casey Cardinia Community Legal Service. The cancellation of this funding forms part of the legal assistance savings measure contained in the 2013-2014 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The total savings to be achieved under this measure comprise $43.1 million over four years. Nevertheless, the Government is very mindful of the need to structure those savings in a way which protects the most vulnerable clients of legal assistance services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have therefore directed that the funding of legal assistance services be focused on providing front-line services to disadvantaged people requiring legal help, rather than using public money for reform and advocacy activities. The Government funds legal assistance service providers to prioritise direct services to individuals. It is vital that vulnerable Australians receive the help they need with their legal problems.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The cutbacks to legal assistance funding reflect the gravity of the fiscal position which the Government inherited. In order to repair the Budget situation, and ensure that Australia is re-set on a path of growth and prosperity, the Government has been compelled to exercise stringent discipline in its expenditure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has aligned all Commonwealth legal assistance funding arrangements to end on 30 June 2015. This provides an opportunity for the Commonwealth, states and territories to work together with the sector to reform legal assistance arrangements from 1 July 2015. Proposed reforms are intended to support a sustainable legal assistance sector by ensuring that services are directed where they are most needed and are delivered in a more coordinated and streamlined way.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's consideration of future funding arrangements will be informed by the findings of the review of the National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services and the final report of the Productivity Commission's Inquiry into Access to Justice Arrangements which was released on 3 December 2014.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Details of the new funding arrangements will be settled by Cabinet through the 2015-16 Budget process and cannot be released until they are announced on Budget night.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for writing on this matter.</span>
            </p>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DYN" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr JENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:02</span>):  Madam Speaker, in my last statement as Chair of the Standing Committee on Petitions I discussed some of the effects that petitioning the House can have. Today, I would like to focus on the origins and role of the petitions committee. As you know, Madam Speaker, the Standing Committee on Procedure tabled a report in August 2007, which recommended a series of changes to standing orders designed to improve the way the House deals with petitions. One of the key facets of these changes was the establishment of a committee dedicated to dealing with petitions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Standing Committee on Petitions was established in 2008. Standing order 220 provides for the committee to receive and process petitions and to inquire into and report to the House on any matter relating to petitions and the petitions system. Prior to 2008, petitions were assessed by the Clerk or Deputy Clerk to ascertain whether or not they met the requirements. Under the current arrangements, it is the petitions committee that performs this role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Petitioners lodge their petitions with the committee either directly or via a member. The committee meets each sitting week to examine the petitions received and determine whether they meet requirements. Petitions which meet requirements are found in order and prepared for presentation. Those that do not meet requirements are found out of order and returned to the principal petitioner with advice on preparing petitions for the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also plays an important role in regard to presenting petitions. While some petitions are presented by members after their consideration by the committee, others are presented by me as chair during the petitions timeslot on sitting Mondays. This mechanism allows any citizen to have their petition announced in the House, regardless of whether a member is able to present.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After petitions are presented, the committee then refers the terms of the petitions to the minister who is responsible for the matter. Ministers are expected to provide a response to the petition within 90 days of presentation. Before the changes of 2008, very few petitions received any ministerial response, as the standing orders contained no expectation of a response. Since the changes were implemented, nearly every petition receives a response. This is one of the real strengths of the current approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once the committee receives the ministerial response, it considers the response at its next meeting, and the responses are presented to the House by me, again during this timeslot on sitting Mondays. The committee then sends the response to the principal petitioner, thus keeping them informed of the progress of their petition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Considering and presenting petitions and responses are not the only roles performed by the petitions committee. The committee also has an important part to play both before petitions reach the House and after ministerial responses have been presented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public outreach is an important aspect of the committeeâs work. The committeeâs web page is an excellent source of information on how to petition the House, and also contains contact details for the committee secretariat. Anyone who is considering petitioning the House would benefit from consulting the web page and contacting the committee secretariat before they commence gathering signatures. In this way, petitioners can help ensure that their petition will meet the requirements, and thus will be referred to the responsible minister for response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another facet of the committeeâs work is the conduct of public hearings. A few times each parliament, the committee conducts public hearings with petitioners and government officials. The purpose of these hearings is twofold: firstly, it gives the committee the opportunity to receive community feedback on the petitions process and, secondly, it allows petitioners and government ministers or officials to discuss the issues in petitions at greater length than can be achieved via the petition and its ministerial response.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr SOUTHCOTT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:08</span>):  On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the committee's report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Report 447: EPBC Act, cyber security, mail screening, ABR and Helicopter Program</span><span style="font-style:italic;">â</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Review of Auditor-General </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eports Nos 32-54 (2013-14)</span>, together with executive minutes on reports Nos 417, 422, 443 and 445.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This report details the findings of the committee's examination of five Australian National Audit Office reports. Two key themes from these reports were the importance of agencies taking an appropriate risk-based approach and also, where appropriate, working cooperatively with others to achieve common objectives. Chapter 2 of the report discusses the committee's findings concerning Audit report No. 42 on the screening of international mail. The committee found that Customs and the Department of Agriculture had made progress in response to the Audit Office recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the committee remained concerned about two matters: international best practice for mail screening and the state of cooperative arrangements with other countries regarding identification of illicit firearm shipments. Accordingly, the committee recommended that Customs and the Department of Agriculture undertake a review of methods of screening international mail to ensure Australia conforms to international best practice, with these agencies to then report back to the committee. We also recommended that Customs report back to the committee on the existing state of cooperative arrangements with other countries regarding identification of illicit firearm shipments and what discussions might be underway to strengthen these arrangements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chapter 3 of the report discusses the committee's findings concerning Audit Report No. 43, <span style="font-style:italic;">Managing compliance with Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act </span><span style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">onditions of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">pproval</span>. The committee found that it will require a sustained effort from the Department of the Environment to ensure ongoing improvements to its EPBC Act compliance framework in the transition to new one-stop-shop arrangements. The committee recommended that the Department of the Environment report back to the committee on its continued progress implementing the Audit Office recommendations and the new one-stop-shop assurance framework. The committee further recommended that the Audit Office consider including, in its schedule of future performance audits, a follow-up audit of the department's management of the compliance framework. The committee also recommended that the department take a leadership role in its governance arrangements for this area by demonstrating effective reporting against appropriate performance measures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chapter 4 of the report discusses the committee's findings concerning Audit Report No. 48, <span style="font-style:italic;">Administration of the Australian Business Register</span>. The committee was disappointed to note that, some 14 years after it was established, the Australian Business Register does not yet provide a single entry point for business interactions with government, and that the Australian Taxation Office and its partner agencies have made little real progress towards reducing the registration and reporting requirements of business. While the committee acknowledges that the tax office and its partner agencies are committed to these whole-of-government objectives, we believe that a closer working relationship between these agencies is necessary. The committee therefore recommended that the tax office and its partner agencies work more closely together to reduce entry points to government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chapter 5 of the report discusses the committee's findings concerning Audit Report No. 50, <span style="font-style:italic;">Cyber </span><span style="font-style:italic;">attacks: s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ecuring </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">gencies' ICT </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ystems</span>. Over the course of the review, the committee was concerned to note that, of the seven agencies audited, not a single agency was found to be fully compliant with the top four mitigation strategies and related controls in the Australian Signal Directorate's Information Security Manual and none of the agencies was expected to achieve full compliance by the mandated target date of July 2014.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chapter 6 of the report discusses the committee's findings concerning Audit Report No. 52, <span style="font-style:italic;">Multi-Role </span><span style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span style="font-style:italic;">elicopter Program</span>. At over $4 billion, the program is to acquire 47 helicopters and their support system for the Australian Defence Force. The committee recognises that much of what is currently causing difficulty in the program is the result of decisions made about 10 years ago. Since that time, Defence has improved its performance in the area of acquisition and sustainment and is taking measures to rectify as best as possible the project's shortfalls. The committee believes there is still much more to be done, and has made a number of recommendations to manage the risks in complex acquisition programs. The committee was also recommended that DMO publish annually figures on Australian industry content in their acquisition and sustainment contracts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I thank committee members for their deliberation on these significant matters. I also thank departmental representatives who appeared at public hearings for assisting the committee in its important role. I would like to thank the committee secretary, Susan Cardell, the inquiry secretary, Dr Kate Sullivan, and all members of the committee secretariat for their assistance in preparing the report. I commend the report to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Charlton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:13</span>):  I appreciate the opportunity to briefly comment on Audit Report No. 52, <span style="font-style:italic;">Multi-Role </span><span style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span style="font-style:italic;">elicopter </span><span style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rogram</span><span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>and the findings of the Australian National Audit Office and our committee on this project. As the chair said, this is a $4 billion project that is now delayed over four years. That delay stems from acquisition decisions made in 2004. When the acquisition strategy was developed, the desire of the government of the day, quite understandably, was for a military off-the-shelf option and they thought they were acquiring that with the NH90 multi-role helicopter. Unfortunately, that helicopter was developmentalâas was the other option; the US optionâand Defence and the DMO failed to properly take account of that and change the acquisition strategy when the government of the day effectively selected a developmental option.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The chair is quite right; all the problems that we are seeing now arise from that original decision. We need to get the balance right. The Bushmaster program was held up as a poster child of problem projects for many years because it was developmental, but in the end we have got a fine platform that survived over 50 explosions on deployment and saved the lives of countless ADF personnel. We have to get the balance right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The key lesson in this audit was that if you are going for a developmental project then understand you are going for a developmental project and take the appropriate risk mitigation measures. I am happy to say that DMO and Defence have improved, through the Kinnaird process begun under the Howard government and continued by the Mortimer review under the last Labor government, the projects of concern process instituted by Minister Greg Combet and the major projects report process started by the JCPAA. All of those things are contributing to improved Defence performance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The specific recommendation in this report goes around measuring local content. We have shifted from specifying a nominal figure of local content to be delivered in Defence contracts to an emphasis on winning work in global supply chains. That is absolutely the right thing to do because that means we are not trying to manufacture kit for 47 Australian helicopters. It is about getting into the global supply chain for thousands of helicopters around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point of our recommendation is that we should be measuring that contribution effectively and we should be reporting on that to parliament and the Australian people so they understand the jobs benefit of winning work on Defence contracts. I commend the entire report to the House. I thank the ANAO, the agencies and the committee secretariat for their excellent work on this project. I also thank the committee chair for his collegial approach to this report and every other report I have been involved in.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In introducing the Imported Food Warning Labels Bill 2015, I doubt whether there is anyone in the House that is not aware of the break-out of illness and disease that has followed from eating imported food product. When you get sick you do not know how or where you got sick or how you contracted the illness that you have. It is very rare that you can trace it back to the food you have eaten. You might have had up to 40 different types of food in the last day or so and tracing each one of them back becomes very difficult. In this case, we know definitely and definitively that a couple of dozen people in Australia have contracted a very serious disease, hepatitis A, which, I might add, is also a communicable disease, from eating imported berries. The state of my much esteemed colleague from Tasmania is a big producer of berries, as is the state of Victoria and as is the Atherton Tablelands, in the heart of my electorate in North Queensland. At a hotel there where I stay, they have at any one point in time probably close to 100 workers who work in the berry plantations of North Queensland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has been through four issues that have pervaded and dominated the politics of this country. The first issue that broke out with the conscription battle in the First World War was nationalism, and behind it was whether we were British or Australian, or whether we were English or Australian. The second great battle came out of the Great Depression, and that was capitalism. Capitalism had an awful lot to answer for as a result of the Great Depression. The forces that opposed capitalism metastasised into communism. That had very great sympathy in Australia, particularly in the Labor Party, through the International Socialist Movement, which was financed and pushed by Russia and to a lesser extent China. Almost exactly every year the communists took over a new countryâthey took control with the gun. The great leader of the communist movement in those days was Mao Tse-Tung, and in fact one of his great quotes was that power grows out of the barrel of the gun. This is the period of 'marketism'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We decided that free markets should be all-pervading. This period is a bit different from the other periods because both sides of the political divide hooked onto this notion of marketism. They were very committed to abolishing all tariffs and subsidies. When all the tariffs and subsidies were abolished, they had to look for other fields to conquer, and what they did was change the approach to quarantine. So you had apples that were treated in New Zealand, America and China with streptomycin to fight fireblight, which is endemic in those countries. Those apples came into Australia with fireblight content. With orangesâI fail to be able to pronounce the poison that they use in Brazil on citrusâevery single citrus analysis has indicated that that poison is part of the citrus fruit coming into Australia, albeit a very small part. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether or not you agree with the abolition of tariffs or subsidies, this marketism has now reached a fanatical levelâand it is an almost obsessive fanaticism. It joins all of those other 'isms' that preceded it. Let me give you some examples of this fanaticismâand I use that word with a forethought. I represent a fairly big flower growing area and I recently had some flower growers come in to see me. They have a 100 per cent inspection level. Every single box of flowers that leaves Australia has to be inspected by a quarantine officer, and the cost is $300 an hour. I will not go into a breakdown of that cost. The growers just could not compete against the imported product. You say, 'We want to inspect those flowers because we want to protect the buyers overseas.' Well, what about protecting the Australian people? We have a 100 per cent inspection level in an abattoir. Every single piece of meat that goes out of that abattoir is inspected by a human being, with his own eyes. The food coming into the country is supposed to have a five per cent inspection levelâthat is the regulationâbut there is not enough money to do the five per cent, so in actual fact they do less than one per cent. The situation for exports is a 100 per cent inspection level, which is at a huge cost, and, in some cases, it is as much as $300 an hour, whereas for imports it is less than one per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My worthy colleague from Tasmania represents a state that is very big in prawn and fish farming, as I do. In fact, I had almost all of the Australian prawn farming industry in the Kennedy electorate. We did not get the figures from the library but we will get them later this week. If memory serves me correctly, in prawn and fish farming in Australia we went up to about $650 million, and now it has declined to about $65 million. I would ask no-one to take those figures as accurate because I have not had time to get them on account of the weekend intervening. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there was a huge growth and then a huge decline. The decline came because the food producers in the countries north of us have no hygiene requirements. There is no testing of bacteria levels in the water going into the farms and there is no testing of the bacteria levels of the water going out. There is also no sedimentary assessment, so how much solid matter is in the water is not taken into account either. There are no rules concerning that in the countries north of us, where we buy most of the fish and prawns that we consume in Australia. Most of them are now imported and almost all of them are imported from East Asia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are no hygiene requirements of the water going in and there are no environmental requirements of the water going in. There is no assessment of the physical properties of the water going in, such as turbidity, which is the amount of solids in the water. Not only do we have to have all of those things perfect, but we also have to have them perfect going out of the ponds. In our ponds, the water goes in every day and goes out every day, so by definition there cannot be anything wrong with it. I will let the member for Denison, my worthy colleague Andrew Wilkie, go into some detail about Tasmania. I am not going to do that today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The net result of this has been that our cost structures more than doubled. We have to clean the water going out and it has to be pure water coming in. It goes out the next day, and it can hardly get impurities in it in one day. But if you force that cost imposition upon us, which of course the government of Australia did, then you double our cost structures. That makes it impossible for us to compete against the product from Asia. So where I had about 1,000 or maybe 1,500 people employed in this industry at a time, I have watched it slowly decline to where there are now probably no more than about 200 or 300, if that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This shows the ridiculous nature of the extremism. Nationalism was wonderful. There was no doubt that this country needed to grow up and become a separate nation. We are not England; we are Australia. That great battle was won by the people of Australia. The battle against the excesses of capitalism in the Great Depression was also won. The battle against communism and international socialism was won. The battle against marketism has been lost dramatically. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Speaker, the liberties we enjoy in this country come at a cost. They were fought for and defended by thousands of Australians, many of whom laid down their lives in service of their country. We on this side of the House recognise that those of us who enjoy these hard-won freedoms have a debt we can never repay in full. But that does not mean we should not try.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have noted previously in this place, my electorate of Ryan is home to the second largest military base in Australia, Gallipoli Barracks, home of the 7th Brigade. I am proud to be able to serve the brave men and women of that base. It was gratifying that the Prime Minister acknowledged my representations on their behalf during the latest pay negotiations. I am also proud to have strongly advocated for certain leave entitlements to be retained in the latest ADF pay deal. At any time our defence forces could be called into action and they need to know that we at home support them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenges to the defence budget are firmly sheeted home to Labor and the Greens. They took defence spending in Australia to its lowest level since before the Second World War. They tore a multi-billion-dollar hole in the heart of the defence budgetâenough to actually build Australia's next generation of submarines that they kept promising but never delivered. Did they spare a thought for the flow-on effect those cuts would have on the 3,000 small and medium Australian businesses directly affected? Of course not. These cuts cost people their jobs and sent businesses to the wall. They even banned the ADF from using local businesses for basic support such as vehicle repair, forcing them to send vehicles to the other side of the country. So they were slashing the budget on one hand and wasting money on the other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the billions of dollars worth of cuts came other reckless decisions which directly endangered the lives of our military forces. They cancelled the planned purchase of new, modern self-propelled artillery for our Defence Force, lessening the force capability of the Australian Defence Force. Self-propelled artillery is longer range, has a higher ratio of fire, can manoeuvre into a firing position, is faster and is crewed by fewer personnel than 'towed' artillery currently in use. What did Labor do? They cancelled it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's shambolic approach to the Defence Capability Plan, including program cuts and delays, was a recipe for disaster that would leave our troops without the equipment they needâwhen they most needed it. Our armed forces are some of the best trained forces in the world, yet Labor cut the number of training days to our reserves by 30 per cent. Our training regime means that we experience fewer deaths in conflicts which have claimed more lives in other countries' militaries. Training is also what makes Australian armed forces respected the world over. It is incomprehensible to me that a government would cut back on training. Yet Labor did just that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only did Labor wilfully lower Australia's force readiness and capability but also it cut funding in real terms to the Australian War Memorial by not increasing their funding for the entire term of their government. That is the contempt they have shown to the place where we honour those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Their contempt for serving personnel was not just limited to cuts in force readiness and capability but to morale as well. The Gillard government cut the entitlement of single personnel to have flights to see their families at Christmas. That cut affected 22,000 serving men and women. Fortunately, the coalition, and particularly the member for Fadden, working with the crossbenches, successfully forced Labor to withdraw this mean-spirited act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott government has honoured its commitment to change the indexation arrangements for DFRB and DFRDB military pensions. Labor promised but never delivered. I will always fight for the rights of our Defence Force personnel to have the best possible equipment, training, pay and conditions, as I did in the last round of pay negotiations. If those opposite want to join me in providing those things for the people who defend us, I urge them to pass the government's budget measures. My support for our Australian Defence Force is unwavering. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0O" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FEENEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Batman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  I am very pleased indeed to rise to speak to this motion and to rebut that farrago of nonsense which the parliament was forced to endure. While those opposite like to present themselves as the champions of Defence, it is plain from the last contribution made that they would do well to enliven themselves with some facts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion begins by congratulating the government for its improved indexation arrangements for the DFRB and DFRDB retirement schemes and the legislation that passed this place with the support of both sides of the House. But let us just remember the precise dimensions of this promise made by the other side. After 11 long years of John Howard doing absolutely nothing to improve these pension schemes, we then saw the then Abbott opposition on the eve of the previous election make a commitment to improve the indexation arrangements. Indeed, upon coming into government, their government kept their wordâone of those very rare occasions when the government kept a promise. They kept a promise and improved the indexation arrangements around these two schemes. Bravo! Well done! But let us remember a couple of key points. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first key point is that both of these schemes have not accepted a new member into their ranks since 1991, so they are schemes that cater to fewer than 60,000 persons. They are schemes that have not admitted a new member for a generation. The vast bulk of the men and women serving in the Australian Defence Force today are not members of those schemes. In order to pay for this, however, the government then embarked upon a series of measures which has left the ADF and our veterans community absolutely aghast. While the government improved the indexation arrangements for those 60,000 persons, it then proceeded to cancel the current military superannuation scheme, the MSBSâcancelled, no announcement, no pre-warning. The current men and women of the Australian Defence Force found that the scheme they were in was cut and that, henceforth, members of the ADF will attract a superannuation rate of 14 per cent as opposed to the 28 per cent that previously prevailedâa dramatic change in the circumstances of our ADF. Of course, it goes right to the fact that retaining the men and women in the ADFâpeople who are highly trainedâand their services has just become that little bit harder. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But not to be undone, the coalition<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s wrath and havoc was not finished there. What we then saw them do was cut the indexation arrangements for 280,000 veteransâsome 310,0000 payments. Some 280,0000 persons had their indexation arrangements changed so that those arrangements became less attractive. We will now see those pensions slowly but inexorably decay against the living wage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government has now leapt to its feet and congratulated itself on improving the DFRB and DFRDB, when you tell the whole story you can see that literally hundreds of thousands of people are worse off and the future ADF will find itself working with an inferior superannuation scheme to that which this government inherited when it came to officeâso a truly scandalous set of arrangements. The fact that a government backbencher has had the sheer front to get up in this place and try to turn it into a positive is a remarkable thing. And it will echo through the veterans community even as I speak, because I am sure there will be absolute astonishment that anyone from the government would get up in this place and try to pretend that they have improved the circumstances of the ADF. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the resolution was not concluded there, with that particular rhetorical point. The member for Ryan went on to the next impossible causeâdefence spending. The motion seems to be suggesting that defence spending under the former Labor government fell to the lowest level since World War II. I think the member for Ryan may be confusing which government she is seeking to talk about, because for six of the 11 budgets handed down under the coalition from 1996 to 2007, defence spending fell to the lowest level since 1938 as a percentage of GDP, whereas in 2008, under Labor, spending rose to 1.94 per cent of GDPâthe closest we have come in a generation to spending two per cent and much closer, I might say, than those opposite have done or will ever do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2013-14 budget Labor provided Defence with a record $114 billion across the forward estimates and a further guidance for over $220 billion to be spent over the subsequent six years. These were the greatest commitments made to Defence in the history of the Commonwealth. The previous Labor government was the first government in this land to commit more than $100 billion over the forward estimates. By the time we left office, we were the 12th largest spender on defence in the world. How did the then opposition respond to this fine and outstanding record? They went to the last election promising to spend the same as we spent. They said that an Abbott government would commit to spending the same amount of money on Defence as Labor. That was their great contribution to the debate and now, of course, they have the front to get up in this place and insist that our record does not do this nation justice, a record which they pinned themselves to at the last election. To add insult to injury, they insist that Labor cut the defence budget by $16 billion. I invite the member to nominate where that $16 billion exists. The number is a fantasy. We spent between $25 billion and $30 billion on defence year in year outâevery yearâand I challenge the member opposite to tell me in what year $16 billion suddenly disappeared. It never happened. It is a made-up number.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to job losses resulting from budget cuts, those opposite are experts in this field. We have seen a succession of defence ministers over the course of the Abbott government achieve precisely nothing. We have seen in the shipbuilding space and future frigate program this government assiduously make no decision for 18 months. On the submarine project, I would need another 10 minutesâsuffice it to say those opposite have made a shambles of it too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding the LAND 400 project, the modernisation of our Army, again, we have seen 18 months of delay and dissembling. These major projects that go to the modernisation and future of our services have withered on the vine under this government. The cost has been jobs and the cost has been investment. I invite the member opposite to read the occasional newspaper where he will find Australian industry bleeding and haemorrhaging on the street and jobs being shed from our shipyards week in, week out while the government fiddle like Nero and do absolutely nothing. Your excuse for the last three months of doing nothing has been a new minister who, in his defence, knows nothing about defence and, prior to that, 18 months of absolute gridlock.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yours is a scandalous record. But then, not content to shine a torch on those two atrocious defence policy failures on your part, you then have the temerity to come in here and talk to us about defence training days. Under Labor and Plan Beersheba, we saw the Army reserves develop a level of capability that is simply unprecedented in this nation's history. We were deploying 1,000 Army Reserve personnel every single year on operationsâoperations in the Solomon Islands, Timor, Afghanistan and a range of othersâthat saw reserves achieve a level of operational experience that is simply unprecedented since the Second World War. But you would know nothing of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw changes to the Army Reserve. They became an operational reserve. The Army's force generation cycle integrated them with our regular brigades. There was the application of new capabilities and, I might sayâthe honourable member opposite had the temerity to talk about moraleâan Army Reserve in this country whose morale had never been higher. They had never been better equipped. They had never been more utilised by their government. It has always been us on this side of the House that have understood the capability of the Army Reserve. We have always sought to enshrine their role in the defence white paper. It was, of course, a Labor government many years ago that introduced the Ready Reserve concept and, of course, it was the Howard government that swept that aside and cast our reserves back into the abyss. We saw Labor in the last term of office bring the reserves back to centre stage because we understand that they can provide a real capability, and we deploy them at a level that is simply unprecedented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I turn to the War Memorial. Again, the member opposite had the sheer effrontery to suggest that the War Memorial had suffered under the previous government. Again, the real villains sit opposite. It was their most recent budget that cut the War Memorial's budget by $800,000. We saw Brendan Nelson, the Director of the War Memorial, come out and immediately have to cancel the popular travelling exhibition program. Again, resources, people, and travelling exhibitions were cut. Hundreds of thousands of Australians across regional Australia are no longer able to see those important exhibitions because of your budget cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How does Labor's record stand in contrast? We built the budget of the War Memorial. We built the budget of the Anzac Centenary. Even in our final months in office we provided an additional $7 million to the War Memorial so that it could renovate its World War I gallery. So, on every single measure of this rather remarkable motion, we say that the government should look at its own record and it will find nothing but embarrassment and humiliation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  I greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak on this motion, and I congratulate the member for Ryan for raising these important issues. As a close parliamentary colleague and fellow member of the class of 2010, I have observed the member for Ryan's unwavering commitment to veterans affairs issues since her first day in this place. This commitment stretches back generations, to her great grandfather Sir George Pearce, who served in this place as Minister for Defence and established the Royal Australian Air Force. It is fitting that the member for Ryan should represent a region that includes the Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera. This is home to several units, including the 6th RAR who represented our nation with such distinction and at great loss in Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Ryan's maiden speech highlights her dedication not only to her troops but also to this very issue she has raised in this motion here today. With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to quote from this speech:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Let us never forget these brave Australians and all of our troops and veterans who have answered the call whenever their country has asked. Equally we must never forget that these courageous men and women have volunteered knowing that they put their lives at risk to ensure our safety. It is timely to remind the House of the coalitionâs commitment to ensure that their entitlements reflect the contributions and sacrifices they have made through the indexation of the DFRDB and the DFRB.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It must therefore give the member for Ryan and her constituents such pride to read the first line of this motion:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That this House:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ congratulates the Government on honouring its election commitment to change indexation arrangements for Defence Forces Retirement Benefits and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits military pensions;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this change was only possible with the election of a coalition government. Since coming to office just 18 months ago, we have delivered on our commitments to veterans and their families. We recognise and understand the unique nature of military service, and this financial year will deliver more funding to support veterans and their families. We have restored veterans' advocacy funding, which was cut by the previous Labor government, providing an additional $1 million each year to the Building Excellence in Support and Training program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This coalition government has also mental health at the forefront with a commitment of more than $179 million to meet the mental health needs of the veteran and ex-service community. This includes funding for online mental health information and support, GP services, psychologist and social work services, specialist psychiatric services, pharmaceuticals, PTSD programs, and in-patient and out-patient hospital treatment. The government's funding for veteran mental health treatment is demand driven and is not capped. We have expanded eligibility for services provided through the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service; broadened the comprehensive system of health care for veterans with certain mental health conditions; and deepened our engagement with younger veterans through an online presence, including social media. Veterans can now access specialist treatment for certain mental health conditions, with a referral from their GP, and there is no need for a veteran to submit a claim for compensation in order to be eligible to receive this treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Veterans' Affairs provides training and resources to mental health practitioners, and last year the Prime Minister and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs launched the Prime Minister's Advisory Council on Veterans' Mental Health. It is abundantly clear that this government is committed to the veteran community and that it will continue to do all it can to support our veterans and their families into the future. I have regular contact at meetings and community events with many members of the local Bennelong veteran community, so ably represented by: Bernie Cox, President of Ryde District RSL Sub Branch; John Curdie, President of Epping RSL sub-Branch; Cecil Williams, President of North Ryde RSL Sub Branch; and Chris Cody, President of Gladesville RSL Sub Branch. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I refute the contribution of the member for Batman. I again commend the member for Ryan for her unflagging dedication to these issues, applaud the government for our efforts in this area and proudly commend this motion to the House.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="30540" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRODTMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:49</span>):  With all due respect to the member who put up this motion, it is complete nonsense. The member for Batman has gone through it point by point to highlight the farce and nonsense of this motion, and I echo those views and will support the member for Batman in his forensic assessment of this motion. I do so because I find it galling to listen to those opposite complain about decisions Labor made when we were in government, when this government has continued to show a complete lack of respect for Defence personnel since it was elected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are already onto our second Minister for Defence, which has caused significant disruption in defence planning, defence procurement and defence sustainment. It causes significant disruption because things need to move to the right, waiting for the new minister to be briefed and for his decisions to be made. But not only have we had two defence ministers under this government; this government has also cut the real wages of ADF personnel. The member who moved this motion said in her speech that the ADF has served this country so well, that it is a debt we can never repay in full. One way that you can start making that repayment is to pay them fairly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue of fair pay for our ADF personnel is an issue I have been campaigning on for months now, and it is a decision that the Australian people are still reeling from. At the end of last year the government cut the real wages and conditions of Australia's service men and women. ADF personnel were offered a below inflation pay rise while at the same time their precious Christmas leave and recreation leave were being slashed. After widespread community outrage at this decision, the Prime Minister backtracked on parts of the offer. While Labor welcomed this backdown, the Prime Minister in our view did not go far enough. He is still cutting the real pay of our service men and women. He is still cutting the real pay of the people who defend Australia and our national interests, who we put in harm's way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this unfair pay offer caused outrage in ADF ranks and among their families and the wider communityâand rightly so. There was a flood of complaints on social media, a rally in Townsville and a petition presented to the Leader of the Opposition, all opposing the outrageous offer. In fact the petitionâcreated by Tony Dagger, who is the father of a serving ADF memberâhas collected more than 65,000 signatures. ADF members do not have a voice in their pay and conditions negotiations. They cannot vote and they cannot take industrial action, unlike public servants. That is why Labor has stood up and will continue to stand up for our ADF personnel and fight this unfair pay deal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the attacks do not stop with ADF personnel. The government is also targeting Department of Defence staff. Defence staff have recently been offered a below inflation pay increase of 3.16 per cent over the next three years, which averages to just 1.05 per cent each year. Defence staff will not only see their real wages fall under this insulting offer; they will also lose a range of conditions. They will lose two days leave a year, including Christmas leave, and they will have a slower progression through pay rates. This unfair deal is even worse than what was offered to ADF personnel. Even the defence department secretary, Dennis Richardson, has labelled this wage offer 'regrettable'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last week, we have seen what the government has planned for ADF superannuation. Under ADF Super, the government contribution rate will be 15.4 per cent, increasing to 18 per cent for those engaged in warlike operations. This two-tiered system will undermine the team ethos of the ADF. Last week the Chief of the Defence Force also raised concerns with the government's approach, saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My preference would be to try and do a flat rate which is a midpoint, which does not have the clunkiness between the warlike operations and the peace time â¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Defence Force Welfare Association has also criticised the government over its lack of consultation on the new scheme. On ABC Radio last week, the president said, 'the consultation has more been information sessions on what the administration is coming up with rather than listening'. So it has just been talking and not listening. The member for Ryan omitted mentioning the axing of the three-month backdating of veterans' disability pensions for successful claimants, as well as the planned privatisation of DHA. This is a nonsenseâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  I rise today in support of the motion before the chamber on Australian Defence Force funding. I would like to thank my good friend the member for Ryan for raising this matter today. The people of Lindsay have a long and proud history of serving our nationâfrom the men who joined the early militia to serve king and country in the Boer War to those who heard the call and joined the Coo-ee March, which 100 years ago this year made its way through the main street of Penrith. Like the people of Lindsay, I myself share in this rich military traditionâfrom my grandfather, Lesley Allan, and my Uncle Gary back to my great-grandfather, Arthur Booth, who as part of the Luddenham Light Horse joined the First World War. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a country we pride ourselves on the Anzac spirit of loyalty, mateship and rising above adversityâoften against the odds. It is a spirit which continues to be an integral part of our nation's DNA. To the present day, the Nepean region is home to numerous RAAF bases both inside and outside the electorate, including Orchard Hills, Richmond and Glenbrook. Historically, we were one of the key military communications and transmission sites, through Eastern Creek, Londonderry, Bringelly and Wallgrove Roadâand still at Glenbrook. For many years, the 133 Signal Squadron were stationed at Kingswood. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be part of a government that acknowledges the service of our military personnel and their families by providing fair indexation of the DFRDB and DFRB pensions. This fair indexation will benefit 57,000 superannuants, together with their families. It will give these ex-serving military personnel the fair go they have long deserved. The Abbott government is getting on with the job of delivering to our Defence Force personnel and its former serving members. In recognition of the unique nature of military service, we will maintain a stand-alone Department of Veterans' Affairs to tackle mental health challenges faced by veterans and their families and to provide adequate welfare and advocacy support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard over and over again the claim from some that they are the sole voice in defending the pay and conditions of serving and retired Defence personnel. The truth is that, by their actions, they have probably done more harm than good. For the record, let me remind members opposite exactly what their actions have caused. Firstly, they cut $17 billion from Defence Force spending, cuts almost as big as what this nation spends on Medicare each year. With cuts as big as this, how can you reasonably argue that conditions can improve for Defence personnel? In fact, Labor's cuts to defence budgets put the sectorâs spending at its lowest since World War II. Labor's cuts have resulted in military equipment being run into the ground and our personnel being put at risk through having to use tired old equipment. On top of that, there was a further cut to military trainingâit was slashed by a thirdâall this while our forces were on active duty internationally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be part of a government that has listened and is now delivering. Delivering on this promise will see a further $160 million go into the pockets of our Defence Force retirees. It will end the inequity in these pensionsâespecially for those who have served our nation for twenty years or more. Military pensions and benefits will now be indexed at the same rate as any other pension. This includes pensions through the Defence Force Retirement Benefits scheme and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits scheme. The coalition believes that 57,000 Australians will be better off as a result of these changes.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:59</span>):  I have to pick up on a couple of points by the previous speaker, the member for Lindsay, in her response to the motion moved by the member for Ryan. The member for Lindsay talked at the very end about the fact that what the government were doing was changing the indexation arrangements to make them fairer and to ensure that they would be in line with other pensionsâexcept that they are changing the other pensions. They are changing the other pensions. She said the government are improving the indexation measures for up to 60,000 Defence Force superannuants across a couple of schemes, and that will improve their living standards. Yes, but at the same time they are proposing, from 2017âand they have maintained this commitmentâto alter the other benefits that these people are often entitled to and to adjust their indexation methodologies down. If you are someone who is a TPI pensioner, someone who suffered most grievously for your service for your country and you happen to also be a DFRDB recipient, the bottom line is your superannuation will go up by less than your pension will effectively go down with respect to what the changes would have been.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, rather than hear from me as a politician or from other politicians, let us hear from some of the ex-service personnel organisations what they have been saying about these particular changes from this government. In a media release, the National Round Table of Defence and Ex-Service member Organisations, which covers all the major ex-service organisations other than the RSLâand I will come to them in a minuteâsaid:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The budget proposal to reduce the adjustment of the Veterans Disability Pension by reverting to using the CPI only will hit our disabled veterans hard and particularly our most disabled veterans who are totally and permanently disabled and rely on the Veterans Special Rate Disability Pension for the compensation payments. Implementing this decision would reverse a hard won concession legislated for with crossparty support by the Australian parliament in 2007.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The recent pay decision which purportedly "in no way reflects the value that the Government places on ADF personnel" is but one of a number of decisions in the 'employment package' for ADF members which have the effect of reducing the value of their total remuneration in a time of rising living costs hitting those in the lower ranks disproportionately.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AN1" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOHN COBB</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:04</span>):  Like others who have spoken before me, I rise to support the Defence Force motion moved by the member for Ryan, Mrs Jane Prentice, and to congratulate our government on Defence Force Retirement Benefits and, particularly, Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits pensions. It is unfortunate that the member for Bruce has already left the chamber. I have known him for probably longer than anyone else in this parliament, through strange circumstances. It is good to see him defending the Defence Force, but it is a little strange that he left out what happened during the six years of the previous government in terms of support for that same Defence Force and its role, so much so that it causes me to have to draw the House's attention to Labor's record, because that is what we have, in a sense, the unenviable but responsible job of correcting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government, the now members of the opposition, spent a lot of time promoting their responsibility for and outstanding treatment of our Defence Force. But, unfortunately, it was nearly all talk and, certainly, it was a fabrication. They showed a total disregard for Australia's national security and the thousands of people involved in delivering that. Time after time, they failed to deliver on their promises; they reneged on funding announcements and agreements; they cancelled, changed, downgraded vital equipment purchasesâand I will come back to that and the consequences that can have not just for our security as a nation but as a trading nation; and they had countless policies that led to thousands of job losses. But possibly the biggest untruth from Labor came when they reduced the defence budget to its lowest level as a percentage of GDP since 1938. That is a heck of a long time ago. It is nearly 80 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Does that sound like a government that has considered the best interests of the Defence Force and Australia's security and all that they involve? Of course it does not. If we learnt anything from the Rudd-Gillard government it is that that government could not be trusted and that Labor could not and still cannot be trusted. Unlike the opposition, we can show the proof of that. For example, in 2010, Labor under Prime Minister Gillard declared they would continue to provide budget certainty for defence. They promised to honour the defence funding commitment. Unfortunately, what they did, as I said earlier, was reduce the defence budget as a percentage of GDP to its lowest level since 1938.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what happens when a government gets itself and the nation into so much trouble by promising a budget that will show surplus, which it did not. The one thing a nation elects a government to do is look after its defence and security. Those opposite ignored that in order to try to keep to their commitment that they were going to show a budget surplus. They let Australia's security go down the gurgler because of that. What they actually did was deliver was a disjointed and unfunded disaster. They did things like cancel the purchase of new self-propelled artillery from Korea because they were trying to get the budget in surplus, or not to make the deficit as bad as it was. In doing that, they so upset the Korean government that it would not negotiate with Australia on a trade deal, which badly hurt our beef industry, amongst others. I am not talking about beef just because I am a farmer. What an example! They left us hanging in the air under America because they simply could not deliver. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Charlton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  I am proud to rise to speak in the debate on this motion on the Australian Defence Force because I am absolutely sick on these vicious and uncalled for attacks on the patriotism of the Australian Labor Party. The previous speaker and the member for Lindsay suggested that we were wilfully putting ADF personnel at risk in the field. That is incredibly offensive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous speaker is absolutely right in saying that national security is the first role of government. Let us look at the history of the other side. They are the party whose god is Robert Menzies, a man known as 'Pig Iron Bob', a man who prosecuted waterside workers for refusing to load scrap iron going to fascist Japan because they knew it would come back at us. The Liberal Party support Pig Iron Bob Menzies. They are the party who brought us into Vietnam on a lie. They are the party who brought us into the second Iraq war on a lie. They are the party who tried to politicise the ADF through the children overboard affair in order to win the 2001 election. The Liberal Party cloak themselves in patriotism, but when you look at their actions you see that they will use the ADF and national security for petty political purposes. I say, 'No more.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at the facts of the matter. Let us look at LAND 17, the acquisition of new artillery pieces. The truth is that the Army wanted the German self-propelled howitzer. They were not particularly interested in the Korean piece. The Liberal government, when they were in power last, did not supply enough funds to support the purchase of the German howitzer, so the project was cancelled. Let us look at their broader acquisition history. Of the top 30 acquisition projects currently being pursued by Defence, 87 per cent of the total schedule slippage has occurred in projects approved by Liberal governments. That constitutes 81 years of schedule slippage. Let me repeat that: 87 per cent of the scheduled slippage of the top 30 projects currently being managed by Defence, culminating in 81 years of deferred capability, occurred because of decisions made by Liberal governments. These are platforms that the ADF need that are not in service now because of the incompetence of those opposite. Let us look at the list of projects of concernâthese are projects that are put on a high-profile list because they are in trouble. Of the 10 projects featured on that list, all were approved by coalition governments. They cannot acquire projects, 81 years of schedule slippage; they repeatedly bring us into wars on lies; their God, their ultimate politician, stopped waterside workers from refusing to export scrap iron to fascist Japan. Those on the other side should be ashamed of themselves for bringing this motion to parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at the current debate on submarines. The government have been very concerned to run down the capability of the Collins class submarine, a submarine that is seen around the world as one of the best conventional powered submarines in the world, a submarine that can be the platform for our next generation of submarines. This is all part of the broken promise that they took to the last election to build a new generation of submarines in Adelaide. This is a broken promise that will see the Prime Minister end the jobs of 4,000 to 5,000 shipbuilding and submarine workers in this country, including 900 in my region at Forgacs at Tomago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that we had a plan to bridge the shipbuilding valley of death. We had a plan that we were in the process of implementing. They have no plan except to end the jobs of 5,000 shipbuilding workers and to get submarines made in Japan, which will not be fit for our purposes, in order to secure some sort of stronger relationship between Prime Minister Abbott and Prime Minister Abe. The truth is that you cannot trust the Liberal Party to manage defence acquisitionâ81 years of schedule slippage under those opposite. You cannot trust them to put the national security of this nation first if you look at their actions in Vietnam, their actions before World War II, their actions before the second Iraq war and their actions on children overboard. Those on the other side are content to cloak themselves in patriotism, but when the real test comes to put petty politics aside and act in the national interest they are found wanting. They are found wanting consistently. They will be condemned by history for their actions. I proudly oppose this motion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Springvale Benevolent Society have been serving the people of Springvale and surrounds for 53 years now. They are an essential, integral part of the social services network in my electorate. Through a team of long-term, hardworking volunteers, they deliver food vouchers, blankets and other essentials to the people in my community who are doing it the toughest. Around Christmas Eve last year, the Springvale Benevolent Society received some bad news: their entire budget of emergency relief had been cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Springvale Benevolent Society is just one of a number of groups I will talk about today who are amongst those at the pointy end of a $270 million cut to front-line social services. Right around the country, the community sector is being ravaged by these cruel cuts. Last month, the member for Isaacs, Bruce and I held a forum to bring together these service providers and try to piece together what we could about the situation on the ground. What we know is that emergency relief, financial counselling, parenting programs, support for bushfire victims, housing and homelessness organisations and organisations that support people with disabilities have all had their funding slashed. These organisations have seen their funding cut and they serve literally the most vulnerable people in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is going to particularly hurt in my electorate of Hotham. I represent one of the most multicultural places in Victoria. Many, many families in the region I represent have no-one else to turn to. We have high numbers of recent refugees and recent migrants, who have limited support networks. We have large amounts of affordable housing and caravan parks. We have a lot of people in our community who are affected by a life of disability. The organisations that deliver emergency relief in this community are the last stop for these people when they have literally nowhere else to go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Governing and budgets in particular are about priorities. In the last budget, the government decided to give tax relief to big miners and big polluters, while taxing the sick and increasing the burdens on those who can least afford to pay. In doing so, the government made a decision that it would expand the group of people who will ultimately be relying on these last-port-of-call services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This decision to cut the funding going to the most vulnerable Australians, though, I have to say, is taking this terrible prioritisation to new heights. This is a funding cut that is directed to people who have been at the back of an unemployment queue for years. This funding cut is directed at the homeless. It is directed at Australians with mental illness. All of these people, believe it or not, in this wealthy and prosperous country of ours, do not have food in the cupboard at certain points in the month. These are the most vulnerable Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other organisations that serve my electorate that have a specific ethnic focus, and they have had their funding cut. I want to refer to some of the work that these organisations do. One organisation is the Vietnamese Community in Australia. They deliver support specifically to Vietnamese families and they have a special focus on families with a person who has a disability. I am sure I do not have to explain the deep cultural elements of the particular type of challenge that these families face. It is appropriate that a Vietnamese organisation supports these families. What I hear from the organisations is that a lot of their work is about helping these families get connected into mainstream services that they would not know existed without these organisations with specific expertise in these ethnic communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One issue that should not go undiscussed is the ham-fisted way in which these funding cuts were administered. First, there was the notification on Christmas Eve. Second, there was no information or explanation of why these organisations that have served their communities for decades were having their funding cut, just a cold letter saying that funding had been refused. The letter, believe it or not, was not even addressed to individuals or individual organisations. Is this any way to treat organisations run by diligent volunteers who have given up so much?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are lots of other providers in my electorate who are losing funding, but they have asked me not to name them today, because those that have been given a little bit of funding under the program, after seeing their funding savagely cut, have been told that, if they tell anyone about the funding amount that they have been given, that funding will be taken away. These are the types of tactics that we see again and again from this government. I have written to the Minister for Social Services to ask him how these arrangements are going to be transitioned and to ask him to restore this funding. I have not received a response, but these services will not give up the fight and neither will I.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms CHESTERS:</span>
                  </a>  Oh, there is one. I stand corrected. There is somebody at the bottom of the speaking list. One sole person from the government backbench and the government ranks is speaking on this motion. I think it speaks volumes about the nature of this government that they acknowledge that these cuts are unpopularâand there is only one backbencher or marginal seat member willing to put their name to itâbut they are not willing to act and do anything about these cuts. This motion gave them an opportunity to stand up in this House to say that they were going to reverse the decision to cut $270 million from community grants. Instead, except for one sole personâand it should be noted that one individual does not form a governmentâall of them are in hiding and not willing to speak up or speak about these funding cuts and how they affect our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been mentioned, these grants being cut demonstrates not only the cruelty of this government but also the incompetence. As we have heard, many of these organisations were given a short time frame in which to apply for funding so that they could continue to deliver services to some of the most vulnerable in our community. Some of these organisations have for decades been delivering emergency relief, financial counselling support and related programs to the most vulnerable in our communities. Not only were they given a short time frame in which to reapply for funding, but the deadline within which they would find out about their funding continued to be extended and extended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In December last year I remember meeting with Lisa Simpson, the financial counselling services coordinator with Bendigo Community Health, who said to me, 'We still do not know if we can continue this service next year'. The Bendigo Community Health financial services team supports people who have put their hands up to say they are in trouble. Quite often they are referred to this section of Bendigo Community Health from another service. They work with these individuals to help them get back on track, so they can get themselves out of debt. These are people who have acknowledged that they have financial stress, and they are seeking help. She said at the time, 'We don't know if we can continue to offer this service next year, because we still don't know.' The incompetence of this government to then let people know on Christmas Eveâcruel, but also incompetent, because who can rearrange services on Christmas Eve? Very few organisations have the capability to scramble that way. The organisation was then notified a few weeks ago that they could continue their service until the end of March. Here we are in the first week of March, and they do not know if they will get the opportunity and the support to continue their services into April or May.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another organisation I wish to highlight is Bendigo Family and Financial Services. This organisation provides small loans, financial management training, counselling and emergency relief to those who are struggling due to a range of various reasonsâloss of work, sickness, inability to workâand helps these families living on the margins to get on top of their debt. The organisation was established in 2006 to help break the generational poverty cycle that we have in Bendigo. The organisation has roughly 10 part-time staff, and this funding went towards helping to pay those wages. There are also 70 volunteers. They have a motto that if you receive help we would like you to help others. 'Family', in their title, does not just mean the families they help, but the family environment of the organisation. When we got together for a meeting I remember learning firsthand how important this service is. Over 100 people came to share their experiences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These organisations are now at risk of closing because of this government's cruel decision to cut their funding. I call on the government to reverse their decision not to support this motion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member moving the motion has fallen into the same old Labor trap of following the Maxwell Smart guide to drawing up a motion. Firstly, there is the 'basing your argument on a false premise' trick. It is the fourth time they have fallen for it this week, and it is only Monday morning. The motion wants the House to acknowledge that 'there is a significant, ongoing and growing need for emergency relief.' I have to tell you: it is a false premise. If the member had done a little bit of homework, she would have seen fewer instances of people actually accessing Emergency Relief assistance via the Commonwealth. The figures that have come down from a high of more than a million instances of access for the service, in 2009-10, to just over 900,000, in 2013-14âa decrease in demand for Emergency Relief assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, they have employed the old 'shot yourself in the foot' trickâthe third time Labor has fallen for that this week and we have not even reached question time yet. The member wants to condemn the government for 'cutting core social services to the most vulnerable Australians'. One must assume that the member moving the motion wants the House to condemn her for her role in Labor's cutting of the funding to Emergency Relief. They did it, in 2011-12, by $62. 5; in 2012-13, by $59.9 million; and then, in 2013-14, by $57.4 million. Where were the voices when those cuts were being made? Under the current government, the revised Emergency Relief allocation for 2014-15 is $62.9 million, inclusive of bridging funds for current organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, there is the old 'I live under a rock and didn't see it' trickâthe first time this week. The member wants to condemn the government for, apparently, 'The covert way in which funding decisions have been made and implemented.' Well, she has a funny definition of covert. The Department of Social Services conducted 13 sessions with 1,800 attendees in Canberra, Hobart, Darwin, Brisbane, Perth, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Coffs Harbour, Dubbo, Townsville, Mildura, and Alice Springs. If we were being covert, we sure had a funny way of doing it. Perhaps the member was at a union rally and missed the notice. But those who cared enough to turn up to the May and June sessions understood the changes under A New Way of Working for Grants and how to prepare organisations for an application process. Sessions in November were to support the sector in understanding how grants were being introduced in new grant agreements and to introduce the new streamlined reporting requirements. In addition to those information sessions, the department began consultations with the sector immediately after the budget on May 13 last year. Information was up on the Treasury website, on the Minister for Social Services' website, through the Department of Social Services Grants Hotline, a central enquiries email, a target email advice to grant recipients, detailed program information documents, fact sheets, engagement with peak bodies and key stakeholders including state government departments, advertisements placed in national and major regional newspapers, and a second round of newspaper advertisements. So, it is a funny way of being covert.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the member has fallen for the old 'elephant in the room' trick, and they will fall for it about 20 times this week, I guess. The change this government has introduced is to provide more targeted funding to areas in most need. To get the most benefit out of funding, we must know where the areas of need are. When that is determined, we direct funds there instead of blindly throwing dollars to where they always go, ignoring changes in demographics. The government is determined to get value for every dollar the taxpayer gives up, because, frankly, there are no dollars left. The Labor Party, the subscribers to Maxwell Smart economics, spent the lot and then they borrowed. Then they borrowed some more so they could throw it around like it was freeâand people thought they were getting it for free. I do not know how much of an emergency it was that $900 was going off in cheque form to pet dogs and dead people. Maybe Rover or Great Grandpa was down on his luckâor British backpackers. How much of an emergency was it when the Labor Party felt the need to hunt down backpackers who had already returned to the UK so that the Australian taxpayer could hand over a $900 cheque? As I said, this money was going to dead peopleâI think it is way past an emergency by then. No emergency relief, no matter how big the cheque, is going to help you when you are dead. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time the Labor Party come in here and mention spending, it has to be more focused. They are ignoring the elephant in the roomâthat is, their debt. They have given all Australians a debt sentence, and they should be ashamed.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms OWENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  Once again we have seen a member of a government that has cut $270 million from community services to some of the most vulnerable people in Australia stand up and make a speech that is actually all about us. There are thousands of people all around the country that depend on this emergency relief. Small organisations that have been delivering it and delivering it well for decades have had their funding cut, and the member for Dawson thinks it is about usânot the people it is hurting, not the government which is making the decisions, but the opposition. That is truly extraordinary. There is one government speaker on this motion, and he spent the whole time talking about us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going to speak about the motion and about the issues. It is hard to know where to startâwhether with the brutality and ignorance of the policy itself or whether with the incompetence in its delivery. But I am going to start with the brutality. This $270 million cut to community services delivered in the budget last May reduces the level of emergency services, the services to people who find themselves literally without a bus fare to get to Centrelink, without nappies or food or formula for their child, without money to pay the parking fee when they take their child to Westmead Children's Hospital. This is called emergency relief because it is. The government have ripped away funding to those services. At the same time, just to add to the brutality, they have done things in the budget that will make it more likely that people will need these services. They have announced that young people under the age of 30 will receive no financial support for up to six months every year if they find themselves unemployedâthese are quite a few more people who are going to need emergency services. They have announced cuts of around $6,000 to a family with two kids on a salary of $60,000âthese are a few more people who are going to need emergency services. They have announced reduced indexation, which will see pensioners up to $80 a week worse offâthese are a few more people that are going to need emergency services. At the same time, they have cut funding to the services that these people will need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of the brutality is the ignorance. When the government announced the cuts they also announced that they would be opening up the remaining funds to a competitive tender on a five-year basis, effectively opening the door to very large organisations, because it becomes viable on those sorts of terms. They introduced a tender process which is really beyond the capacity of the small volunteer organisations that have been running these services. And in flooded some 5Â½ thousand applications, which has effectively squeezed out the service providers that have the history and the local knowledge and that have been delivering these services to people with whom they have relationships and corporate memory for many, many decades. These organisations are not inefficient. The usual theory that bigger is cheaper is not true when you talk about these organisations. Holroyd Community Aid, for example, which has lost its funding, received $184,000 last year, with $6,000 going to the audit and the remainder going entirely to members of the community in food vouchers, nappies, medications et cetera. You cannot get more efficient than that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The incompetence is also worth talking about, incompetence in the process itself. In October 2014 the government announced that they had too many applications and that they would not be ready to enter into funding agreements on 1 January, which was the proposed start date. So, in October 2014, they extended the funding agreements to 28 February 2015. Then, between 22 and 24 December 2014, tiny organisations that had closed for the Christmas break received emails saying their funding had been cut and that they would be closing down on 28 February. In my electorate of Parramatta, one of the casualties is Holroyd Community Aid, which has been operating for 48 years. They will close down at the end of February and early March. Then, on 30 January, the government announced further delays, because they still were not ready, and offered extensions to emergency relief to 31 March. Meanwhile, small organisations were trying to tell their customers where they should go when they closed down at the end of February or March, to find out that no-one knew who had got the funding. The secrecy is extraordinary. No-one knows who has got the funding, because if organisations who are getting the funding say they are, they have been told they will lose their funding. So the organisations that are closing down in just four weeks cannot even tell people where they are supposed to go. It is incompetence and brutality from this government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I am really disappointed that there are not more speakers on the government side, more members coming into the chamber and standing up for the community groups in their electorates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia today the gap between the wealthiest and the poorest Australians is widening. The poorest Australians are struggling to survive, and if an emergency occurs they will be struggling even more. Unemployment in this country has constantly gone up under those on the other side of House. The number of jobs is declining and the number of people participating in full-time employment has fallen. Newstart allowance is at a very minimal level. There has been an assault on single parents, who are struggling harder and harder. We are now hearing that people with disabilities will have to bear the brunt of this government's harsh approaches. There are working poor in this country, with a decrease in full-time employment and casualisation of the workforce, with those people receiving no sick leave or carers leave. These are all components that lead to making it harder for people that need little bit of help from government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">About 12.8 per cent of all Australians live below the poverty line. Consider that in the context of the grants that we are discussing here today. The process for these grants has been handled appallingly by the government. They extended the grants for six months, then they extended them again till March and, where just two days before Christmas, they made phone callsânot even having the decency to do it in writingânotifying organisations that they had been defunded. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have ripped $21 million out of organisations that provide services to marginalised and struggling Australians. This is the Abbott government way: attack those people who cannot stand up for themselves and attack those organisations that provide support for them. By attacking those organisations, they are attacking those volunteers that work in them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Organisations are put on hold at the moment; they are just waiting to find out whether or not they are going to receive funding. It is like purchasing a car and finding that the engine does not work properly. Those organisations that are getting funding, I hear on the grapevine, are actually receiving less than they need to operate the programs. They are getting the car but they are not getting the engine. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that there have been a number of organisations on the Central Coast of New South Wales, part of which is covered by my electorate, that have lost their funding. I am really surprised that members are not in this chamber standing up and arguing for those community centres. One such community centre is the Warnervale Family and Community Centre. They lost their funding so they closed last Thursday, which I think is really deplorable. The member for Dobell made an excellent speech upstairs about International Women's Day and about the high level of domestic violence on the Central Coast, but here she is silent when it comes to talking about the closing of these organisations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The allocation for relief funding for the Central Coast was nearly $900,000 per annum, and the feedback that I am getting is that what has been paid is significantly less. Other organisations that have lost their funding are organisations like the Gosford/Narara Neighbourhood Centre. They lost all of their $240,000 of funding. The Entrance Neighbourhood Centre neighbourhood centre lost all of their $57,000 of funding. St Vincent de Paul were also unsuccessful. These are all organisations providing vital services for people on the Central Coast. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

What we are looking at in my electorate is increased demand coupled with decreased funding. What we are going to see is decreased provision for our most vulnerable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lalor has great community organisations, and they deliver smart, efficient and strategic problem programs that support the most vulnerable in our community. In Lalor, this is occurring where we have the highest eviction rates in the state, where unemployment in Melbourne's west has reached 8.4 per cent and youth unemployment is at 23.2 per cent. In this context, this government is choosing to make things more difficult. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of these smart and efficient services in Lalor are Werribee Support and Housing, which has been operating for 30 years; Laverton Community Integrated Services, which has been operating for 26 years; and the Salvation Army. Those three services are involved in emergency relief, while Anglicare and the Smith Family provide financial and often emotional support for families in crisis. They assist with financial counselling and capacity building to assist families to put things right and get back on their feet. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the one hand, we have the emergency relief and the implications of that, and on the other we have the cuts of the programs that we know make the difference and cuts to the preventative measures that our communities worked so hard with these agencies to put into place. What is more important is that these local agencies negotiate with local landlords to find emergency housing when regular avenues are closed. They work together creatively to ensure maximum bang for the federal government buck, and here they have been rewarded by cuts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These agencies also use deep local knowledgeâirreplaceable local knowledgeâof who is who in the zoo. They use insight to make things happen quickly, they support one another to keep ahead of the curve and create ways to implement prevention strategiesâstrategies that work and make all the difference to families facing crisis. They all rely on a paid and unpaid workforce to support individuals and families on their worst days. They work with the most vulnerable in our community on their worst days. These organisations have been operating with an austerity axe poised above their heads since this government took office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time since this government took office, we have had a Productivity Commission report that outlined really positive outcomes in the sector. In 2012-13, 244,176 people across this country received support from homelessness service agencies. These people are already the most marginalised in our communitiesâyoung people, Indigenous people and those facing situations of domestic or family violence. These housing services can make all the difference. For example, that Productivity Commission report says that 93 per cent of people accessing homelessness services had achieved some or all of their case management goals at the end of their support period. That is an extraordinary achievement, and yet in recognition of that what we have are cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also had a Senate inquiry of which I was really proud. All of the agencies in my electorate put in collective and individual submissions to that inquiry, demonstrating the work that they were doing and the number of people that they were assisting. But, despite that happening across the country, what we have seen since this government came to office is the dismantling of the COAG agreements and the homelessness council, and $270 million cut from the system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that we have increased demand and decreased funding, and the response from this Minister for Social Services have been crippling. Services who have worked in this area for decades are still unsure of what their responsibilities will be. They are sure that they have had their funding cut from their past grant allocations, but they are unsure how far they are going to have to make their cut dollars go and in what areas of the community and who they will be working with on the ground. More need and less support is the story that is happening in my electorate. My community deserves better. These agencies deserve better. Our most vulnerable deserve better. These grants create positive outcomes in the worst circumstances, and they need to be reinstated in full.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GRIFFIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  This government has taken many decisions that have been met with disbelief in the broader community. They have been decisions which have been argued strongly by both sides, and decisions where sometimes you can argue there is a case one way or the other. I have to say that of all the decisions this government has taken, the decisions that have been taken on community grants are the most indefensible, are some of the most cruel, and have had impacts on real people in electorates all over Australia. It is something that the government needs to think about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is easy to cut community grants. You do not have to get legislation through the Senate, you do not have to worry about having a regulation disallowedâyou can do it with the stroke of a pen. This government have done exactly that, but they have done moreânot only have they used the stroke of a pen; they have used subterfuge and confusion to camouflage the extent of the cuts and the nature of the cuts and how they are impacting on the community. We have heard from other speakers the nature of the process that has been followed, if you can call it a process. Applications were soughtâapplications which required onerous detail in the paperworkâand then there have been the various bureaucratic mechanisms deployed over the last six to 12 months to ensure the people do not know what is happening. We have a situation where the government has had to extend funding because their own processes were not working. We have had a situation where community groups have been asked not to say a word about what they had been told because other matters were still being resolved. They cannot even go out there and tell their story about the people they care for. Some groups have had the courage to come out, and frankly, because so many groups have been cut completely, the circumstances are such that they have nothing to lose. I will tell you who does have a lot to lose, and that is the people that they look after.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the member for Hotham for putting this motion forward. I was involved in a community summit with her and with the member for Isaacs and the state member for Clarinda, and we heard from groups in our local areas about what is happening to them. As I said, some of those groups were not keen to talk because they were concerned about how that might be interpretedâthat was the sort of word they had got back from government bodies with respect to what they could and could not say. I am going to identify a couple of them but I will particularly go to the overall view. These groups are overwhelmingly volunteer groups. They are people who put their time in to provide a service. They advocate for people and help them to deal with the problems they are facingâit is people involved in things like financial counselling, which can ensure that people do not get into the financial trouble that would require additional government assistance down the track. They are people involved in organisations like Dads in Distress, who help people going through severe domestic trauma to deal with their circumstances and to ensure that the situation does not end up in the need for police, incarceration or further financial deprivation. There are organisations that provide emergency relief to people who are really doing it hardâpeople who are refugees but who are unable to access formal assistance from government in any real sense. The local paper quotes one of the representatives of the Springvale Benevolent Society, who says that 'some of our clients will starve' as a result of the changes that have been made. These organisations provide services that are intrinsically important to supporting government. One says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Centrelink refers to us. They're a Federal Government agency and they refer to us. But the Federal Government won't fund us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's an inhumane decision. No one will look after the families we look after. They're struggling. Some are disabled. Some are refugees. People will starve and it will be on their heads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The society president, Joe Rechichi, has nearly 650 people on his books, including 500 children. He says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I've lost some sleep. I can't even sleep at night. I know what it's like â¦</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes are inhumane. These are cuts that will affect the most disadvantaged in society. It is interesting to note that, for a motion for which there would normally be an equal number of speakers from both sides, the government have not been able to get enough members up to defend their action. They ought to be ashamed.</span>

This is a complex piece of legislation dealing with national security and other important security matters. The committee has spent a vast amount of time looking at the legislation and putting together 38 substantial recommendations. We have taken our time. We have given great thought to itâgreat considerationâand every member of the committee has participated in a real and bipartisan way in ensuring that we have the outcome that we have reached. So to all members of the committee, and in particular to the deputy chair: thank you very much for your cooperation in this regard. Can I also thank the members of the secretariat, some of whom are with us here today: thank you, also, for your great efforts in putting this report together. I think that the Intelligence and Security Committee has met for longer hours than any other committee in this term of parliament; I think we have also produced more reports than any other committee of this parliament. A lot of that is due to the great work that you have undertaken in your secretariat roles, so thank you very much for the outstanding work that you have all done.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is intended to reverse the long-term erosion of the investigative capabilities of Australia's law enforcement and national security agencies, which has been caused by changing technology and business practices within the telecommunications industry. The bill would require companies providing telecommunications services in Australia to keep a standard set of telecommunications data for two years. The bill also contains new safeguards and accountability mechanisms that will apply to law enforcement agencies accessing the content of communications and telecommunications data. In particular, the bill substantially expands the role of the Commonwealth Ombudsman in overseeing the use of powers under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979. The committee strongly supports this measure, and considers that this enhanced role for the Ombudsman will provide significant reassurance to the parliament and to the community.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry has followed on from the committee's 2012-13 inquiry into the potential reforms of Australia's national security legislation, which was chaired in the previous parliament by the now deputy chair. The committee has also had the benefit of reviewing the reports on the bill by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. In the course of this inquiry, the committee received 204 submissions, 31 supplementary submissions, and more than 200 pages of evidence at three public hearings, in addition to private evidence. The committee has carefully considered all of this evidence, and has produced a comprehensive report with 39 recommendations aimed at ensuring the proportionality of the proposed mandatory data retention scheme, and further strengthening the bill's safeguards and accountability mechanisms. The committee has concluded that the introduction of a mandatory data retention scheme is a necessary and proportionate measure in response to the current challenges faced by security and law enforcement agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has recommended that the two-year retention period that is proposed in the bill be maintained. The committee has made this recommendation in light of the particularly strong public interest in investigating serious and complex criminal activity, and serious matters of national security. These investigations rely heavily on access to older telecommunications data. The committee has made a number of recommendations to strengthen parliamentary oversight of the scheme, including that the data set and the list of agencies permitted to access data should be set out in primary legislation. Complementing this, the committee has recommended establishing emergency declaration powers, subject to safeguards, for the Attorney-General to include items in the data set or to declare an additional agency able to access data. Further, the committee has recommended an ongoing role for the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security in reviewing any changes to the regime. I draw particular attention to the committee's recommendation that it be enabled to look at operational matters in the limited area of authorisation of access to telecommunications data relating to ASIO and the AFP, consistent with the committee's remit. This recommendation would enable, for the first time, direct parliamentary oversight of the operational activities of the AFP and ASIO in this limited area, and represents a significant new safeguard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has recommended strengthening the safeguards around the use of telecommunications data for determining a journalist's sources, requiring agencies to provide a copy to the Commonwealth Ombudsman or the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS) of any authorisation for access to such data. The Ombudsman or IGIS would then be required to notify the committee as soon as practicable and provide a briefing accordingly. The committee has also sought to conduct a separate review on this topic, to be undertaken within the next three months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the committee has made recommendations to ensure the privacy, security and confidentiality of telecommunications data that would be retained under the bill. In addition to recommendations to ensure that retained telecommunications data is stored securely and is encrypted, the committee has recommended prohibiting civil litigants, with appropriate exceptions, from accessing telecommunications data being held solely in compliance with the mandatory data retention requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following consideration of its recommendations, the committee has recommended that the bill be passed by the parliament. Once again, I thank all members of the committee, and I thank the secretariat. On behalf of the committee, I thank all of the organisations and individuals who participated in this inquiry.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="008K0" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BYRNE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:59</span>):  It is my pleasure as deputy chair to speak on the advisory report on the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014. I appreciate the opportunity to speak relatively briefly on this particular report. I would also start off by commending all of the members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. It is not a committee where you get headlines or where you get the latest instalment of some breakdown in bipartisanshipâwhere one person says one thing and another person says another thing. It is one of the very few committees in this parliament that comes together and puts aside political considerations in the national interest to come up with the best possible consideration of any legislation or matter before it. Given the competing tensions that existed in the matter as it was being debated, the depth of feeling within the communityâwhich was matched by the desire of the agencies to have the powers that they are seekingâit says much for the debate that occurred within the committee and it says much about the character of the committee members. I would like to commend the chair of the committee, the member for Wannon, for his incredible work in very difficult circumstances. I notice that the member for Bass, Mr Nikolic, is here and I commend him for his work on the committee as well. I also commend the long-suffering secretariat, who are sitting in the advisory box, and thank them for their enormous work, along with the two seconded officers, who we are not allowed to talk about, but I will thank them anyway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, when you read the headlines and the cutaways, you do not see the phenomenal amount of work and consideration that goes into a matter as complex as the one we are debating here today. As the chair said, in 2012-13 the committee or its predecessor was faced with the enormous task of reporting on an extensive collection of proposed national security legislation reforms. We have seen the follow through of that with three tranches of legislation that have come before this parliament, and this is the third tranche of legislation that was contemplated in that 2012-13 report. I am certainly pleased that a number of the reforms proposed have been considered and referred to the committee for further consideration. It is with great pleasure that I am able to talk about the advisory report on this third, and probably most controversial, tranche of the national security legislation reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Leading up to this inquiry, there was little doubt that data retention would be the most extensive and controversial tranche of the proposed national security legislation reforms, but it is also important to state that these reforms may also be the most significant tranche in ensuring the protection of Australia against the ever-growing threat posed by terrorism, both international and home-grown. Despite the threat level we face today, the proposed changes to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act certainly have not been welcomed with open arms by all parties concerned. We acknowledge that, but it has been the role of this unique committee to take into consideration the position, knowledge and insight of all those parties both for and against these reforms. The committee was then required to assess whether the proposed changes were necessary measures to take; whether the measures proposed were a proportionate response to the threat that we face today; and whether granting these measures is an appropriate response to this threat. The decision taken by the committee was that these powers needed to be given to the agencies to combat the ongoing threat of terrorism in our country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who has had a terrorism event occur in his electorate, I can speak with some measure of authority and knowledge about the impact a terrorism event has on your community. This is not any mere discussion for me about a proposed or potential terrorism threat; this was a real event that occurred that almost led to the murder of two police officers and to the assailant being killed by an officer trying to protect himself, his fellow officer and the Endeavour Hills Police Station. Whilst I counsel some about this discussion of the national discourse about terrorism being a long way away from me, it was not a long way away. For me it was realâit was real enough in that it was some 300 metres away from where I lived for many years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a hypothetical event for me; this is an event that occurred and that informed a lot of my consideration about why the agencies did in fact need these powers to combat the threat of terrorism. One of the key things that came out in the evidence about why the agencies need these powersâwhich some describe as draconian but I would describe as necessaryâis the incredible pace of change that is occurring with the radicalisation. In some cases it can be a mere four weeks between someone accessing the internet and becoming radicalised. I have seen this in a local instance, not far from my electorate, where a young woman was radicalised in the space of four weeks and is now one of these so-called jehadi brides in Syria. To me this is not a theoretical discourse about what might happen in our country; it is what has happened in my electorate and what continues to happen around my region; and what we need to do to give the agencies the powers to prevent further activities of this nature taking place in my electorate, my community and our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not as though this committee did not consider these matters carefully and deeply. As the chair knows, we took evidence from a variety of individuals, both from the agencies seeking to have the additional powers and from those diametrically opposed to the law enforcement agencies having these powers. I must say in contemplating the outcome of these reports and these hard-argued recommendationsâwhich I hope will be adopted in full by the Attorney-General and which we will see reflected in the legislation to come before this House or perhaps the Senate before the end of this weekâit is a testament to the work that has been done in a bipartisan way by the committee. To those who say that this has been rubberstamped by the committee, which I find offensive, I would say this: 'Look at the 38 recommendations that are contained in the report.' I have been somewhat disheartened by some of the commentary that this committee basically did not look at the matter seriously or that it did not offer the community the protections it needs. I would ask those who make those criticisms to examine the regime in the United Kingdom and United States. Having been deputy chair of the previous committee and deputy chair of this committee, my view is that there is no other committee to my knowledge in the Western world that has looked at data retention as closely as our committee has or has had so much import into the structure and architecture of this report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might also say, with respect to those that you would have expected to have criticised this data retention regime, that we have had eminent people, like Professor George Williams from the Gilbert and Tobin Centre of Public Law, that have accepted the need for mandatory data retention; and also, I think, Professor Gillian Triggs, who for the Human Rights Commission acknowledged that there was a need for a data retention regime. So I would say to those that blithely say that the committee has not fully considered this matter that it has; that, as the chair said, there have been many, many, many hours of discussions about the principles that surround the architecture of this metadata regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In quickly finishing off, look at some of the protections: listing the dataset in the bill itself, so we know what data is being retained; limiting access to telecommunications data to only those law enforcement agencies specifically listed in the bill; oversight of operational use of this legislation by the committee, which is the first time this committee has been given the power; authorising ASIC and the ACCC to access telecommunications data to assist in the investigation and prosecution of white-collar crime; requiring telecommunications companies to provide customers access to their own telecommunications data upon request; requiring stored data to be encrypted to protect the security and integrity of personal information; prohibiting access to telecommunications data for the purposes of civil proceedingsâfor example, preventing its use in copyright enforcement; requiring a mandatory data breach notification scheme to ensure telecommunications companies notify consumers if the security of their telecommunications data is breached; increasing the resources of the Ombudsman to strengthen oversight of the mandatory data retention scheme; and a mandatory review of the data retention scheme by no later than four years from the commencement of the bill. That is a very comprehensive list of safeguards, and they are not the safeguards in their entirety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot have a discussion about national security laws without acknowledging the growing threat that our country faces from the terrorist menace. What needs to be contemplated by those that have some resistance to this metadata regime is that they can be reassured that the committee looked very extensively at the case for and against. You can rest assured that some of the safeguards that have been put into this reportâthat hopefully will be enshrined in legislationâare amongst the strongest safeguards in the Western world for any data retention regime. You can be reassured that we will continue to monitor the implementation of this data retention regime. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a great honour to work as the deputy chair of this committee on this report, to work with my fellow committee members, and I certainly and wholeheartedly commend this report to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RIPOLL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  It gives me absolutely no pleasure whatsoever to speak on this bill, because this bill abolishes the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, CAMAC, which is a longstanding committee that is efficient, thorough and has provided essential advice and service to all governments and the community for a very, very long time. It plays an integral and critical role in the proper functioning of our markets and corporations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot believe that this bill is before us. It beggars belief. It is just another example of the government shooting itself in the footânot understanding its role, not understanding the importance of markets, and not understanding the work that this particular committee does and how it does that work. This is a perfect example of a government that has no idea about itself, about its own agenda, about the economy, about Australians, about how markets work or about efficiency. This is a government that is rolling from one crisis to another, and this is a perfect example of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill abolishes the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee for no good reason. There is not one good reason for abolishing that very, very fine committee, made up of quality Australians, who provide, almost on a voluntary basis, a critical advisory service to the government. Governmentsâprevious governments, this government and other governments; not only governments but also the communityâhave made enormous use of and benefited greatly from the work that is being done. To get rid of this committee really does beggar belief. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be very interested to hear what government members have to say in defence of why they would want to get rid of this committee that provides them with quality adviceâthat frank and fearless, quality, nonpartisan, non-political advice that is so essential to decision making when it comes to very important issues about our businesses in this countryâsmall business, big business, small and medium enterprises and corporationsâand the way markets work and the way that we interact with them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum has some explanation, though. It explains and states that the cessation of CAMAC is expected to have a positive impact. I take that word with some irony, because there is nothing positive about abolishing CAMAC. It says it has a positive impact on the fiscal balance of $2.8 millionâthat is it: $2.8 millionâand on the underlying cash balance of $3.1 million over the forward estimates. I am not talking about per year; I am talking about over the next four years. So for much less than $1 million a year we have a fantastic committee, made up of quality, eminent Australians, who work almost voluntarily in the time that they give of their own knowledge, their own intellect and they work much, much beyond anything that the committee requires. To have this government for a few measly coinsâthis number, this so-called saving of $3.1 million over the forward estimates, would barely register in budgetary terms on any fiscal position of the government or this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor absolutely opposes the abolition of CAMAC. CAMAC, as I have said, is an apolitical committee. It is made up of corporate and business experts who have been a very, very valuable resource to government for many years. In fact, when the former parliamentary secretary to the Treasurer, the member for Moncrieff, introduced the bill to the House he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill fulfils a commitment â¦ to achieve a smaller and more rational government footprint.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not see how making things smaller by getting rid of a key advisory body actually helps anybody. I do not think it really can help the government's budgetary position. There is nothing rational about it either because it does not achieve the government's own goals. Maybe the government does not understand what it is here for. Maybe the government does not have a program and an agenda. Maybe the government does not know why it is in government. Maybe it is just in government because it thinks that winning power and winning government and sitting on that side of the House is itâthat is the goal and the goal has been achieved and it is just about staying there as long as possible rather than looking at what things it can do for the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former parliamentary secretary to the Treasurer said it 'fulfils a commitment', but a commitment to whom? The question would be to whom is the commitment to have a smaller footprint, a smaller government. I do not know to whom. I will ask that question many, many timesâto whom does this fulfil a commitment? It would not be the business community, because the business community would have an expectation, if anything, that the government would enhance CAMAC because of the great work it does not that it would get rid of it completely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This commitment does not have a rationale from our markets because our markets rely on good, efficient processes and good information. When there are reviews to be done or critical issues that need to be debated in this place, who do we turn to? We turn to CAMAC, because CAMAC has the resources and expertise. When Labor want to seek the advice of business people, the business community of experts, and ask their view and opinion, we turn to CAMAC. But this Liberal government does not need any advice, apparently. When it is faced with critical decisions, who does it turn to? Apparently it is nobody. It turns to itself. It is inward-looking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen this. We have seen this in the rolling crises that are before the government today. There are things happening with the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, and there is a lack of confidence from his own backbench. We know this in absolute terms because there was a recent pollânot a newspaper poll or phone poll but a poll of the government's own party roomâand it emphatically demonstrated that there is no confidence in the Prime Minister. This is just another example of why. Their own people have no confidence in the Prime Minister. Who else would have any confidence in this government when they are getting rid of a key independent advisory body? Getting rid of it would save them such a small and trifling amount that you would barely notice it anywhere. Certainly you would barely notice it in the budget papers compared to the value that it brings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So rather than treating CAMAC, this expert advisory committee, in a non-political way, by doing this they are actually politicising it. They are politicising this advisory body and the good business people and experts who are on this committee. Somewhere deep in the back of my mind I thought there was a chance or an underlying theme from the Liberals that they are somehow pro-business and pro-market. But I cannot figure out what they stand for. I cannot see it in any of their actions. I cannot see how they are pro-business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you that the business community do not agree with the government on this. The experts do not agree with the government on this. They think the government has got it really wrong. They think the government is making a big mistake. If the government wanted to gain some confidence from the business community it would drop this bill altogether and say, 'Sorry, we have made a mistake here.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think they have a bit of form on this. There is something happening here. I have only picked it up in the last couple of weeks or monthsâor maybe a bit longer. There is a bit of form from the government and the Prime Minister. They do not like experts. They do not like independent bodies. They do not like business people, for that matter. They do not like anyone who has maybe a different view to theirs, as small a difference as that might be. I think I have it.</span>

                    </a>  You can like me or dislike me; it does not really matter! I think I have worked it out, though. If somebody does not agree with them on something in particular then they get rid of that person if they can. But if it is somebody like the Human Rights Commissioner then they cannot get rid of that person because that person has a mandate for five years. If they cannot get rid of them, what do they do? They vilify, attack, character-assassinate and do everything they can to bring that person or body down. That is what they have done. We have seen that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government and the Prime Minister might think that is really clever and that, by character-assassinating or rubbishing an independent authority or people who have more expertise in an area than they do, somehow that puts them in front and they win with the public. I do not think that is right. I can almost understand why the government would go down that path if the Human Rights Commission had a different view to theirs, but in this case here it seems to me that they are just attacking their own people. If we are to believe the government that they support business then we have to ask: why are they getting rid of one of the very, very good-quality advisory bodies that provide the frank and fearless advice that is needed? That is not just something you desire in government; it is actually something you really need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you a little bit about the history of CAMAC, because I think it is important for people to understand. Since 1978 the Commonwealth has had an independent research based reform body focused on corporations and financial markets. It started with the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee and was followed by the Corporations and Securities Advisory Committee and is now known as CAMAC. It changed name in 1989 and in 2002, following the referral of corporations powers from the states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not some trifling little body that we can do without or ignore. CAMAC has produced dozens of reports, too many to list them all here. It is a busy committee. It does a lot of work. If you want to talk about rationales, efficiency and smaller government, this is what delivers it. It is CAMAC that delivers it. The government does not deliver any of it. This is the body that delivers it, and it has done some very, very good work that has led to essential reforms that save consumers money, protects our markets, and provides the efficiency that underpins what we call this great country. If we are going to have good markets then you have to have the right sort of reforms in place. You would want to at least seek some adviceâyou are not just turning to yourself for advice in these areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They have done some great work in terms of continuous disclosure, company restructuring to avoid liquidation, executive remuneration and directors' liability. This is the real red-tape reduction. This is the real work of government. This is the stuff that actually makes a difference on the ground, not that bonfire of red-tape rubbish that we saw from this government when it says it is going to burn 18,000 pages of red-tape. They forgot to tell you that the 18,000 pages-worth are dating back from 1901 and 1905 that nobody had used for about 90 yearsâsome of them were actually blank pages with a line.</span>

                    </a>  I am happy to get rid of them. In fact, we support getting rid of themâsome of them. We did it in government when we removed thousands and thousands and thousands. We did not just have a national day off for the whole of Australia on bonfire red-tape day! When people add up the individual savings, it amounts to a big, fat zero. Some of the efficiency red-tap reduction went so far as getting rid of a comma on a page. They forgot to tell you how much it cost to get a bureaucrat, or somebody in the department, to find where that comma wasâ'Find me a lot of commas and get rid of those!' This is the sort of rubbishâa waste of time and taxpayers money. If it is going to get rid of anything, this government ought to get rid of itself. That would make smaller government. It would make it really efficient too. Get rid of yourselves. No, hang onâyou are working on it. Sorry, I just missed the last couple of weeks. You are working on it. You are getting rid of yourselves. Well done. It would make a lot more sense than having this bill here, which actually gets rid of some really good people and a really good organisation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps, because CAMAC is so independent and made up of expert members who use proper research and verify what they do when providing those quality reports, there is a pattern building here that this government does not want independent advice. It does not want frank and fearless advice. It wants something else. It wants a whole group of people that just say, 'Yes. Yes. Yes. Anything you want. Whatever you say.' The world does not work that way. People will stand up and speak out, and there will be a price to be paid for getting rid of CAMAC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not many people listening to this will have ever heard of CAMAC; I do not expect them to have. I do not expect people up in the galleries to know what CAMAC is, the work that it has done, or how important it is. It is one of those quiet, expert, independent bodies that costs taxpayers a trifling, tiny, little bit of money from the government but provides so much value and so much expertise. So much, that if you add it upâthe value and the savings to the taxpayer, or the efficiency measures to our markets, or the reason why we are held in such regard around the world for some of the thing that we have reformed in this countryâthen you would appreciate the real value of this body.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, this is a government that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. They have no idea what value is compared to price. Anyone can work out $3.1 million over the forward estimates. They will roll that off as if it means something. But, what of the value here? The value that we have lost is enormous. Next time the government might need some advice, do you know where it will turn to? It will pay more than $3.1 million for a report from a friendly consultancy firm who will be told, 'This is the results page with the results we want. Write 500 pages that backup our view.' They will charge that to the taxpayer and it will cost the taxpayer several million dollars.</span>

If it needs advice, it goes and seeks advice and says, 'Here is the outcome, now provide us with the 500 or 600 filler pagesâwhatever the number of pages. We will pay whatever amount of money.' Because, that does not count. Red-tape, bureaucracy and inefficiency do not count as long as they get the outcome that they want. I would not come in here and say all of these things unless there was something behind this supporting it. I have all the evidence that I need in this retrograde step to abolish a fantastic committee that does really great work, and I am looking for reasons here. I think, 'Well, it can't be the dollar saving because it is so small that it makes no difference.' If this government thinks it is going to turn around the economy and create jobs by getting rid of CAMAC, I would like to hear that. That would be of interest.

I think that is simple maths. But, the unemployment rate has only gone up, and is now 6.4 per centâa terrible figure. So, I had to look it up. I wondered when we last had an unemployment rate that high. It was in 1992. Guess who was the industrial relations minister and the minister for employment in 1992?</span>

He was responsible for it back then. So, when I hear that there is going to be a million new jobs and that there will be a surplus every yearâyou hear all this rubbish and you think that that is part and parcel of what is before us here. What this bill for the abolition of CAMAC actually does is completely different from what the government says. It says anything. It promises anything. It does not care.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">"It's very regrettable that for the saving of three salaries a committee that has worked long and hard over decades to basically facilitate business has been cut,'' he said. ''It's been cut with little thought and little understanding of its role.''</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the problem: little thought and little understandingâno idea. Professor Ramsay also said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">CAMAC has delivered a substantial quantity of first-class reports and discussion papers very economically. â¦ We submit that if CAMAC is abolished, the Government will not be able to secure access to this level of expertise and experience at comparable cost.</span>

Again, there is no thought, no rationale, no purpose. That is what happens when you have no purpose in government other than to stay in government.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In an article on the StartupSmart website, Judith Fox from the Governance Institute of Australia pointed out:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"Thereâs a lot at stake in losing CAMAC," Fox says. "Corporations and the financial markets are the lynchpin of Australiaâs economy. If they do not function efficiently, there will be detrimental consequences for business, investors and the capital markets.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think that a Liberal government might just acknowledge or understand that a little, but it is pretty obvious it does not. Maybe it has another agenda or maybeâeven worseâit does not have one at all. Judith Fox continued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Having an expert, research-focused, consultative and independent body like CAMAC to develop and advise the government on best practice policy has made a significant contribution to the strength and efficiency of our corporate and financial institutions. â¦ CAMAC convenes a part-time panel of corporate law luminaries who for all intents and purposes volunteer their time. It is supported by three staff at an annual cost of $1 million," Fox says. "It's a small body that punches well above its weight and delivers economic benefits that greatly outweigh its funding costs, such as our high standards of corporate governance and a stable and efficient environment for corporate activity. These things are easy to take for granted but will be deeply missed when they are gone."</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, in a letter to Treasury responding to the draft legislation, John Winter, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Restructuring Insolvency &amp; Turnaround Association, said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the Government tries to reduce red tape, we are of the view that the Government's decision to dismantle CAMAC is likely to increase red tape in the long term. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will actually make matters worse. That is why we do not understand what this government is up to. The submission further states:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Company Directors <span style="font-style:italic;">strongly opposes</span> the abolition of CMAC and we recommend that the proposed abolition not proceed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The quotes from all these stakeholders set out the concerns and bewilderment of the sector and quite accurately highlight the government's error in abolishing CAMAC. But I do not think we are going to get a turnaround. I do not think this is a government that will think about this in some sort of rational, small-government footprint way. It will go ahead regardless, oblivious to the cost to business, oblivious to the cost of additional red tape and the work it will create in other areas, oblivious to the cost of not listening to that frank and fearless advice and oblivious to the value lost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government made a number of arguments to justify abolishing CAMAC, and they are all pretty poorâsimple as that. I will be very interested to hear if government members have anything further to say. The main arguments have been about cost and smaller government. As I said earlier, they know the cost of everything but the value of nothing. They have no comprehension of what this means for our markets. They have no comprehension of some of the things that are right now on the table that need to be done. But getting advice, particularly from experts and from the business community, is not high on this Liberal government's priority list, and we see that in a whole range of ways, with a recent newspaper story saying 'big business gives up on Tony Abbott and the government'. I wonder why that is! If small business have not already given up on this government, they will very shortly because they are realising that what this government did was give them the old nudge-nudge, wink-wink, 'We're on your side; it's in the ether somewhere,' while at the same time ripping out of the small business community around $7 billion in direct assistance, efficiency measures and a whole range of other things that Labor did in government to promote small business and make sure that small businessâwhether it was in the global financial crisis or in other tough economic timesâhad the support you would expect to keep people working and keep the small business community growing. </span>

                    </a>  The government uses the excuse: 'Well, those were tough years.' Of course they were. Globally, it was very tough for everybody. In Australia we managed to ride that out because Labor took tough decisions; but not one of those tough decisions was to abolish independent advisory committees that actually provide the sort of advice you need in government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether we look at the Law Council of Australia's response to the government's argument or we go over those cost arguments again, it is just a repeat of all the same stuff. It is about costâa few little dollars here, a few little dollars there.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's first argument was that the abolition of CAMAC would streamline the shape of government. I am not sure what shape it thinks it has got and whether we need to streamline it, but you do not get rid of a value-for-money entityâin other words, not get any good adviceâin order to streamline. To counter this, of course, the Law Council stated that the abolition of CAMAC will not result in any reduction in duplication, because it is the only body that does this work. There is no other body. If you had three of these, you would go: 'Fair enough, let's merge them. Let's do something.' That is the challenge. Who else will do this? Who else will provide this particular work and advice? Who will provide the sort of assistance that Treasury needs, that ASIC needs and that professional associations need?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that some government members will see that ASIC can do this. How? The government has cut ASIC as well. Our regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, has $120 million less. At the same time that we want more from the regulator what does this government do? It says, 'We want you to give us twice as much but we're going to give you half the amount to do it.' Of course ASIC, as the regulator, says that it is up to government to decide what level of funding it will give it as a regulator, but there is a price to be paid for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know this is stirring up a few of the souls opposite, because they know this bites in deep. They know that not everybody out in the community might understand this, because they do not have to deal with CAMAC every day or they may not be in the markets on a daily basis, but I can tell you that is a whole heap of people to whom the Liberals and the Liberal government give the old 'nudge, nudge, wink, wink, we're on your side' who will be looking at these guys and saying, 'Whose side are you really on?' According to everything I can find, every quote, every statement, every reviewâby eminent people such as the Law Council of Australia, which is not a small, insignificant organisationâis telling the government: 'You're wrong on all counts.' When that happens I think you have a problem. If we look at some other things that the Law Council of Australia has said about abolishing CAMAC:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ in these circumstances it is highly unlikely that there will be any cost saving, unless the task of corporate and market law reform is substantially downgraded or weakened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the view of the Law Council of Australia, but maybe the government just does not care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's final cost reduction argument is that this will ensure greater value for taxpayers. I think I have already made that point: there is no value in doing any of this. But I will go one step further: the question you have to ask is what is the rush on this bill? You would think there were higher priorities. Remember the debt crisis? Apparently it does not exist anymore and it never did. That is a revelation! I thought that was the case anyway. What is the rush? The bill is currently being examined by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, who are due to issue their report on 16 March. We are just a couple of weeks away from one of the government's committees delivering a report, but they want to abolish the body before the committee delivers its report. Maybe they already know what is in the report. Maybe they already have a view as to what the report is going to say, that CAMAC is a good committee and should be retained. The only rush I can see is to get rid of this before they are given some more advice from people on their side.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What absolutely beggars belief in this is that it is completely antibusiness. This government is antibusiness. It is antimarket. It is anti-efficiency. It will go to any length to get rid of anyone who disagrees with it or produces quality advice, independent advice, fearless and frank advice. We are seeing it in everything it does. We are seeing it in this bill. It should not be supported.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249758" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLIAMS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:41</span>):  I rise today to contribute to the debate regarding the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Amendment (Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee Abolition) Bill 2014. As the member for Oxley departs, I have to say that I expected to hear far more intellectual input from him, as did members of the gallery. When he started there were floods of people up there. They disappeared after a few minutes, and it is no wonder; there was very little evidence. The speech given by the member for Oxley was full of generalisations, rhetoric and heady statements. He talked about markets and who understands markets. We could reflect on the last 15 months, as the member for Moreton stated. We could talk about the free trade agreements and how they benefit business. We could talk about removing taxes. I would have thought that maybe the mining tax might have assisted his good state of Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, we are here today to remove unnecessary regulation, red tape and compliance. This bill will cease the operation of the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, or CAMAC. The cessation of CAMAC will result in the formal termination of CAMAC's legal committee, which was established in 1991. The decision to abolish CAMAC is a result of the federal government's broader smaller and more rational government reforms. This is a very small piece of the puzzle. It will drive greater efficiency and effectiveness. Unfortunately, we did not hear much about efficiency or see much efficiency from the member for Oxley in his presentationâit could have been done in 7Â½ minutes rather than 30 minutesâbut we know that the opposition are not that efficient, productive or effective anyway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will involve the abolition or merger of government bodies where possible to eliminate duplication, remove waste, streamline government services and reduce the cost of administration for taxpayers. CAMAC and its legal committee are two of the 36 government bodies the Abbott government has committed to abolishing as part of our smaller government reforms. These reforms are expected to deliver net savings of about $500 million over the forward estimates, no small amount. In recent years the number of government bodies has grown out of control, which is why we have taken affirmative action on this front. The National Commission of Audit estimated that there were around 900 bodies. Further research prepared by the Department of Finance for the 2014-15 budget found the number to be closer to 1,000 different government bodies. Obviously things have become unwieldy and need to be changed. With so many bodies and agencies, many with overlapping responsibilities, lines of accountability become blurred and action can too often be uncoordinated. All of this is unnecessary and confusing for many, resulting in costs for the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first phase of the Abbott government's smaller government reform agenda was implemented after the 2013 election and reduced the number of government bodies by 40, making a good start to our commitment to help government efficiency. CAMAC and its legal committee are two of the 36 government bodies the Abbott government has committed to abolishing as part of the second phase of our smaller government reform agenda. These actions and the savings associated are absolutely necessary so that the government can repair the budget and strengthen Australia's economic future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The move to abolish CAMAC and its legal committee is also part of what we are doing in terms of cutting hundreds of millionsâin fact, billionsâof red and green tape each year. Why is this important? That is because bad regulation and too much regulation hurts productivity, deters investment and innovation and costs jobs. After essentially flatlining for a decade, total factor productivity fell in 2013. This is one of the many challenges that our country faces in terms of lower productivity growth. In 2014, Australia ranked 124 out of 148 countries for the burden of government regulation in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index. Obviously, things need to change and improve. While we improved four spots on last year, we are still immediately behind Colombia and Spain and just in front of Iran. They are not exactly the OECD nations that we compare ourselves with more regularly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission has estimated that regulation compliance costs could amount to as much as four per cent of Australia's GDP. When our economy is challenged, little things like this matter. The government's efforts to reduce unnecessary costs and increase efficiency in how public funds are used to deliver services to the community are vital. The government believes an additional layer of taxpayer-funded bureaucracy is not required for industry to put its views on corporate regulation reform to government. This is about common sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard of Labor's efforts. In little more than five and a half years, Labor introduced an additional 21,000 regulations. This is despite Kevin Rudd's promise in 2007 of one regulation in and one regulation out. I put this to the member for Oxley; the member for Isaacs, who is sitting here; and the member for Moreton: how many additional regulations did you put on the table and how many did you remove? I imagine that there were thousands added rather than removing any.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This question has been asked: how will the government regulate corporations law, financial products and the services industry? Part of the answer is the Treasury's Markets Group, which will continue to advise the government in relation to corporate law, financial markets and financial services. The advice of Treasury will continue to be informed by regular engagement with relevant experts and industry. While the government recognises the contribution that CAMAC has made to the development of corporate and financial services law reform over the past 25 years, the business environment has changed from 1989 when the agency was first established.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to good policymaking processes. Where any significant regulatory changes are proposed, the government will engage in genuine consultation with stakeholders, including through the quantification of the cost of any new regulations in a regulation impact statement. That is an important initiative of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What other bodies can provide advice to the government on corporations law? The member for Oxley identified one himself: ASIC. That will retain the capacity to advise the government on matters associated with the administration and reform of corporations legislation, companies, segments of the financial products and services industry, and proposals to improve the efficiency of financial markets. The government will continue to obtain high-quality, independent advice in relation to the reform of corporate and financial services law by commissioning specific reports and inquiries that utilise market specialists on an ad hoc basis. This approach will ensure that the advice provided is practical and supported by evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not hear much evidence from the member for Oxley until about 20 minutes through his presentation. Then we heard a few quotes from industry bodies. It was good to hear, but it could have been done earlier in the speech to identify the areas outlined. The government's approach will ensure that the advice provided is practical and supported by evidence and that the most appropriate specialist expertise can be utilised. The government can also refer matters regarding the corporate regulatory framework to other government research and advisory bodies, such as the Productivity Commission and the Australian Law Reform Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is anticipated that the bill will be introduced in the spring 2014 sitting period and CAMAC will be wound up early in 2015. The cessation of CAMAC will generate savings of $2.8 million over the forward estimates. However, ceasing the operation of small bodies and committees like CAMAC generates savings beyond merely the savings of annual appropriation in funding. The ongoing operation of small agencies absorbs resources across the broader Commonwealth public service; for example, there are oversight and administrative costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of the provisions in this bill relate to transitional and saving matters. Many of these provisions are standard provisions that are included, in some form, in all agency abolition bills. They preserve rights that currently exist. In no way do they purport to preserve CAMAC as an entity. The transitional and saving provisions do things like continue CAMAC's assets and liabilities after cessation as if they belong to the Commonwealth and substitute the Commonwealth for CAMAC in relation to contracts and other instruments, in relation to things that CAMAC did or does before its cessation and in relation to legal proceedings that are on foot upon the commencement of the bill. They also provide for the continued protection of information.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  I speak today on the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Amendment. (Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee Abolition) Bill 2014. The member for Moncrieff, in his former capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, has told us that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill fulfils a commitment made by the government in the 2014-15 budget to abolish CAMAC and its legal committee as part of the effort to achieve a smaller and more rational government footprint.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say, I am shocked that any member of this shambles of a Commonwealth government can utter the phrase 'rational government' with a straight face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the real problem is the member for Moncrieff's claim that this bill will achieve a smaller government. This government talks a lot about deregulation, about red tape and about 'smaller government'. I do not cavil with the principles underlying that kind of rhetoric. Of course, we should strive to regulate in the most efficient manner possible. Of course, we should restrict government to activities where we are confident that government intervention will serve the public good. Of course, it is the task of every Commonwealth government to find savings and efficiencies. Labor did all those things in our time in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this Abbott Liberal government does not want to do the hard work required to achieve those ends. The modern Liberal Party, it seems, clings to an increasing doctrinaire view of the role of government. They think that any cut is a good cutâthat every and any saving is justified. The past nearly 18 months of government has shown just how wrongheaded this approach is. Since its election, this government has pushed to abolish the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. This body, of course, has been publicly defended by those it regulates. The charities sector has rallied to the value and the usefulness of this agency, which was established by the former Labor government. It is an object lesson for the Abbott Liberals that not all regulation is to be opposed, and the government has now signalled a reversal on its foolish course of action in relation to the ACNC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also sought to abolish the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. This is actually a great example of the wrongheaded approach that this Liberal government has taken to regulation and oversight. The Independent National Security Legislation Monitor is a very inexpensive office that, in fact, investigates whether onerous antiterror and counterterror provisions are justified. It is an oversight agency charged with reviewing and making annual reports to government and the parliament on whether or not counter-terrorism legislation should be continued in force. So it is right to think of it as a kind of deregulatory agency, but that was apparently entirely missed by this government in its rush to abolish and cut where ever it thought it could.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very happy to see the Liberal government back away from this measure, too, and that since realising the error of their ways have filled the vacancy they allowed to occur when the first occupant of the job of Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, Bret Walker SC of the New South Wales bar, ceased in his three-year term in April this year. The government allowed the position to remain vacant for several months because they were intent on abolishing the position, but, having seen the error of their ways, they have now at least appointed someone to act in the position pending security clearances being completed. And, of course, not only has the government reversed its decision to abolish this small agency, but has seen fit, appropriately, to give some new tasks to the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor in relation to legislation that passed through the parliament towards the end of last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, with this bill, we see yet another example of the Liberal government not being able to see the wood for the trees: yet another ill-considered cut, yet another time that the Liberal Party is wilfully blind to the demonstrated value of a particular government bodyâa value that is apparently inconvenient to this Liberal government's ideological commitments. This bill would abolish the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee. Since 1978, the Commonwealth has had an independent research-based reform body focused on corporations and financial markets. This started with the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee, in 1978, and was followed by the Corporations and Securities Advisory Committee, in 1989, which became CAMAC, in 2002, following the referral of corporations powers from the states to the Commonwealth, when corporation regulation became an entirely Commonwealth matter. In the time that it has operated under that name, CAMAC has produced dozens of reports, and while there are far too many to list all of them, some of the recommendations that members of this House might be familiar with in more recent times are reports and recommendations that CAMAC made in relation to continuous disclosure, company restructuring to avoid liquidation, executive remuneration, and directors' liability. All of them are core matters in relation to corporate regulation; all of them are matters of tremendous interest to the work of this parliament and to the corporate community in Australia; and all of them are at a particularly expert level, because that is the way in which CAMAC has operated now for many years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">CAMAC is a statutory body corporate, but it comprises part-time members appointed by a Treasury portfolio ministerâwe learn this from the explanatory memorandumâunder section 147 of the ASIC Act. As the explanatory memorandum makes clear, members of CAMAC are appointed in a personal capacity on the basis of their knowledge and experience in business, financial markets, law, economics or accounting. Then, we are told, CAMAC is supported by a full-time executive of three staff. That is where the supposed saving is drawn fromâthe abolition of the full-time executive of three staff is going to marvellously save a great deal of money for the Commonwealth. We are told that it is a couple of million dollars over the forward estimates, and for that the government is prepared to sacrifice the immense knowledge and the immense experience that it has been able to harness for the public good through the time spent by the part-time members of CAMAC for many years now in advising the government and the community on matters of importance in corporate regulation. It is an independent body and it is an expert body, and it brings to public discussion of corporate regulation a great deal more than might be possible from a full-time staffed body, because it harnesses the expertise of people working in the private sector; it harnesses the expertise of people working in academia; and it harnesses expertise of people who might have no wish to be full-time employees of the Commonwealth, but are more than happy to give up their time, experience and knowledge in the cause of an informed debate on matters of corporate regulation. The independence and the expertise of the members of CAMAC mean that it has been a resource utilised by governments and opposition alike in policy formulation. There is a very, very good recent example of this in the report CAMAC produced on crowdsourced equity funding, which my colleague the member for Chifley utilised in developing his excellent recent discussion paper on this topic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from members oppositeâgovernment members and backbenchersâit is hard to find a single voice anywhere in Australia that supports the decision that this government has wrongly made to scrap CAMAC. I would start with the comment made by Professor Ian Ramsay from the University of Melbourne. Professor Ramsay is a person of long experience and great eminence in corporate regulation. He said: 'It's very regrettable that for the saving of three salaries a committee that has worked long and hard over decades to basically facilitate business has been cut. It's been cut with little thought and little understanding of its role.' And, despite that comment by Professor Ramsay, none of the speeches from those opposite have suggested that any understanding or any thought has yet appeared on the government side.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Business Law Section of the Law Council of Australia wrote to Senator Cormann about this decision. Their letter was very similar in effect to the sentiments expressed by Professor Ramsay, stating: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">CAMAC has delivered a substantial quantity of first-class reports and discussion papers very economically.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We submit that if CAMAC is abolished, the Government will not be able to secure access to this level of expertise and experience at comparable cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">George Durbridge, again someone of tremendous experience in corporate regulation, wrote an article titled 'CAMAC to be abolished', published on the website of lawyers Herbert Smith Freehills, which includes the statement:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If CAMAC did not exist, we would have had to invent it. If it ceases to exist, we will have to reinvent it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Institute of Company Directorsâhardly known for their radical viewsâsay that they 'strongly oppose the abolition of CAMAC' and that they 'recommend that the proposed abolition not proceed'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is incredible to me, and I think to people who are bringing any objective view to bear on this matter, that the current crop of parliamentary Liberals have gone so far down the rabbit hole of anti-government rhetoric that they now agitate to destroy institutions which Australian business insists are invaluable. I will repeat that: this is a government intent on destroying institutions which Australian business says are invaluable. For just a couple of million dollars of savings, they will destroy a body whose output supports the smooth operation of vast parts of our economy. It is a decision to be condemned. This legislation should be condemned. The government should be ashamed of itself for the way in which it is blindly pursuing its anti-government ideology.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:03</span>):  I rise to support the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Amendment (Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee Abolition) Bill 2014, which delivers on this government's commitment of a leaner and more efficient government. This bill amends the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to cease the operation of the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, otherwise known as CAMAC, and its legal committees. As a member of the coalition government, I support lean government. One of the key commitments of this government is to reduce the size of government and ensure that government services are as efficient and relevant as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CAMAC was established in 1989 to provide independent advice to the Australian government on matters relating to: the amendment, administration and reform of the corporations legislation; companies or a segment of the financial products and services industry; and proposals to improve the efficiency of financial markets. CAMAC is a statutory body corporate comprising part-time members appointed in a personal capacity on the basis of their knowledge and  experience in business, financial markets, law, economics and accounting. CAMAC was established to advise the government in relation to reform of the corporations legislation following the efforts to bring about a national framework for corporations and security regulation throughout the 1980s. At the time the effort required to progress the harmonisation of state and territory regulation into a single national law saw little time for extensive consideration of how these laws should be reformed more broadly to promote economic development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The formalisation of CAMAC provided the Commonwealth with an independent group to advise on how this unified law, or the manner in which it was currently administered, could be improved. The work of CAMAC has expanded from advising on corporate and financial market matters into areas of financial services and products as the Commonwealth has legislated on these issues through the Corporations Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian businesses have developed strong industry representation and no longer require a taxpayer funded committee to put forward their views. The government acknowledges the contribution CAMAC has made to the development of corporate and financial services law reform over the past 25 years. In consideration of the evolution of the business community over the last 25 years, CAMAC is now deemed obsolete. It has become an additional layer of taxpayer funded bureaucracy which is no longer required. The cessation of CAMAC will generate savings of $2.8 million over the forward estimates. The committee's abolition will not in any way prevent or hinder the business community from being able to engage with the government on issues arising in corporate law, financial markets and financial services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will terminate the operation of CAMAC by repealing part 9 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act and making a number of consequential amendments to that act. It also makes a number of consequential amendments to the ASIC Act as a result of the repeal of part 9 and provides for the transitional and savings arrangements that are necessary to reflect the cessation of that agency. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that business no longer requires a government body in order to express their views in relation to corporation laws. The government will continue to work with Australian businesses and carefully consider their views and opinions. The government is committed to open and transparent policymaking processes and, where any significant regulator changes are proposed, the government will engage in genuine consultation with the stakeholders. We will continue to quantify the cost of any new regulation in a regulation impact statement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury will continue to advise the government in relation to corporate law and financial services. In addition, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission will continue to operate under its enabling legislation to make recommendations to the government about any matters connected with the following: a proposal to make or amend the corporation legislation; the operation or administration of the corporation legislation; companies or a segment of the financial products and financial services industry; and the efficiency of the financial markets. Moreover, the government retains the ability to refer matters regarding the corporate regulatory framework to other government research and advisory bodies such as the Productivity Commission and the Australian Law Reform Commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission has previously completed reviews on the regulatory burden on business in relation to directors' duties and liabilities in 2006 and executive remuneration in 2010. The government announced in last year's budget that we would abolish the CAMAC and its legal committee as part of our efforts to achieve a smaller and more rational government. The government believes that an additional layer of taxpayer funded bureaucracy is not required in order for business to present its views on corporate regulation reform to government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the 2013 election, the government has reduced the number of government bodies by over 250. In the 2014-15 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the government announced the abolition of 138 government bodies; the consolidation of 15 government bodies into existing government departments; the transfer of two bodies out of the Commonwealth; and the merger of 26 bodies, while a further five will consolidate their offices with shared service centres or supporting departments. The abolition and merger of some government bodiesâincluding the CAMACâwill improve coordination and accountability, reduce the costs associated with separate governance arrangements, and increase efficiency in how public funds are used to deliver services to the community.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for smaller and more efficient government is essential if we are to contribute to repairing the budget and ensuring the ongoing sustainability of government operations. Former President of the United States Ronald Reagan once said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members opposite adopted this approach and believed that government had an answer to every question. This is why Labor introduced more than 21,000 additional regulations that stifled investment and job creation. So much for Labor's 'one regulation in and one regulation out' policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government wants to get out of the way of business, reduce needless bureaucracy and allow the economy to grow. This is why we are getting on with doing what we said we would do: cutting $1 billion in red and green tape each year. Since the election, the government has more than doubled this target, announcing over 400 measures and a net reduction of over $2.1 billion in compliance costs. Last October, the government removed approximately 1,000 pieces and over 7,200 pages of legislation and regulation. This was in addition to our first repeal day, where over 10,000 pieces and 50,000 pages of legislation and regulation, and over $700 million of compliance costs were scrapped. Members opposite were quick to downplay our achievement, as they fail to understand the importance of having a sustainable and efficient government. Unnecessary regulation hurts productivity, deters investment and innovation, and costs jobs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has the unenviable status of being ranked 124th out of 148 countries for burden of government regulation in the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index. Alarmingly, the Productivity Commission has estimated that regulation compliance costs could amount to as much four per cent of Australia's GDP. Despite members opposite dismissing these concerns, this government will continue to designate two parliamentary sitting days each year as repeal days to eliminate costly and unnecessary legislation and regulation. Not only will this result in more efficient government and productive business; it will improve our nation's competitiveness, helping to create more jobs while lowering household costs. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our deregulation agenda has been welcomed by Australia's small business community. Last month I was fortunate to welcome our Minister for Small Business, the Hon. Bruce Billson MP, to Dobell to meet with stakeholders from our small business community. Minister Billson is a refreshing change for local small business operators, who know they finally have a minister who understands the challenges of running a small business. The minister heard firsthand from small business operators on how this government is strengthening the environment in which they operate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the cost of compliance is a major barrier to growth. The average Australian business deals with eight regulators in a given year. Businesses spend close to four per cent of their total annual expenditure on complying with regulatory requirements and spend approximately 19 hours a week on compliance related activities. This impacts on a business's capacity to grow and drive job creation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former Labor government left 200,000 more Australian unemployed, because they did not understand how business works. Their 21,000 new regulations put a handbrake on the Australian economy. Their gross debt, which was projected to rise to $667 billion, dried the well of capital and finance that was available to businesses looking to grow and expand. In contrast, this government has removed $2 billion of red tape and compliance costs and has commenced the difficult budget repair job. Every Australian understands the budget is under pressure. We were elected to fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster and return the budget to surplus. We will succeed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Measures proposed by this bill promote lean government and remove government interference from the daily operations of business. Measures such as this assist in growing the Australian economy. A stronger economy means a stronger budget. We have seen the opposition treat our deregulation agenda with contempt. Furthermore, members opposite appear to take pleasure in deliberately getting in the way of the budget repair job. The Labor party continues to block $30 billion of vital budget savings, even opposing savings it once promised when in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With declining terms of trade and more pressure being placed on budget revenues, it is essential that Australia have a government which takes responsibility for the budget seriously Let us not forget that Labor managed to turn nearly $50 billion in the bank into projected net debt of well over $200 billion. This was the fastest deterioration in debt in dollar terms and as a share of GDP in modern Australian history. This is why our government has methodically examined the role of government in the business community. We have looked at all workings of government and with bills such as this we are ensuring that government is as rational and cost effective as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lean government will lead us toward a sustainable future. The government's reform strategy clearly establishes criteria to introduce new regulation. It is important that we ask ourselves what is the purpose, cost and impact on productivity of proposed initiatives before regulating. Only after these questions are answered and only when it is absolutely necessary, with no sensible alternatives available, should government proceed to regulate. Since our election we have already implemented several substantial amendments to the regulatory process, including: requiring cabinet submissions proposing legislative changes with a significant regulatory impact to be subject to the regulatory impact assessment process; establishing designated deregulation units within ministers' departments; and finalising ministerial advisory committees to advise on deregulation priorities and opportunities for cutting regulation; where appropriate, linking the remuneration of senior members of the public service to their performance in reducing red and green tape; having the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet take over responsibility for deregulation and the Office of Best Practice Regulation; and establishing deregulation as a standing item on the COAG agenda, enabling federal and state governments to cut duplication and overregulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the former government we will ensure rigorous and mandatory post-implementation reviews to determine how effective new regulations have been. The Borthwick-Milliner review, commissioned by Labor in 2011, reported in 2013, in reference to the previous government, 'a widespread lack of acceptance of and commitment by ministers and agencies to the regulatory impact assessment process.' This government is committed to ensuring that we will not have an economy strangled by regulation and red tape. We are doing what former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said he would do, and that is to take a giant pair of scissors to the red tape that is strangling small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's key reform themes are to: minimise and simplify business interaction with government bodies; reduce regulatory obligation and reporting; fuel economic growth; and implement common sense reforms. Measures such as the abolition of the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee demonstrate this government's success in simplifying government and deregulating the Australian economy. The government will continue to work closely with our business community to ensure that our reforms assist them rather than hinder them. The government must demonstrate confidence in the business sector and support them to work productively with us in implementing reform that will strengthen the Australian economy and lead to greater job growth. I look forward to ongoing deregulation and simplification of government and commend this bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You have all these people who have reflected in such strong and positive terms about CAMAC, and what is the government's position? The government's position is to kill it offâit will just wipe it out, having just come to office, and for what reason? The reasons offered are, frankly, bizarre. One of them is, 'Well, the National Commission of Audit told us to do it, so we are doing it; they said that there would be an efficiency made in doing this, and so we are cutting it.' Really? How much is being saved by getting rid of the three officers who work in CAMAC or support CAMAC's workâa body that has been around in various forms and that in one way or another has been providing this type of independent and impartial advice since 197? It has been re-formed and reshaped until its more modern version, which came about in 2002. What is the grand saving from getting rid of an impartial body like CAMAC, with its three peopleâit is $1 million. And the government tells us it is doing this because the National Commission of Audit told them to do it. The National Commission of Audit also wanted to take a fairly significant hammer to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, and that is billions of dollars being directed to certain parts of the country. What happened? That was left alone. When it comes to CAMAC and the enormous $1 million strain it is putting on the budget, it is being got rid of. This is the mentality of efficiency and streamlining that would suggest that if you ripped your car aerial out you would be more aerodynamic. This is the type of thinking we see from the government in the abolition of CAMAC. It is bizarre.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the last speaker, the member for Dobell, being asked to defend this, and he could not actually get to the substance of the matter. Instead, we heard the mantra that comes out of this governmentâwhich only ever focuses on what happened in the last three years and cannot think about what should happen in the next three. And, when they put forward ideas that are as useless as this one that is being put forward now, they cannot defend themselves. There is no ability in this governmentâin anything they doâto put a cogent, logical, substantive and defensible position forward as to why they would put these types of reforms on the table. CAMAC has demonstrably been seen to provide independent and fearless advice in corporations reform. So why would it surprise me that a party which is responsible for deforming FoFAâand which is doing whatever it can to bend itself to the will of major financial interestsâtakes this position? And of course, that is the only logical consistent position that this government could have: 'Well, we do not want anyone independent giving us advice on how to manage the Corporations Law or markets advice.' Look at their track record: when it came to doing the right thing on financial advice, or on corporations reform, what did they do? They listened to the big end of town on FoFA. And they haveâ</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HUSIC:</span>
                    </a>  As the member for Lalor rightly says, they tapped the map. They have failed to do the right thing by the broader community; they do the right thing by a powerful section of the communityâa section of the community which has enough resources to defend itself instead gets defended by this government. And obviously, this is why we say that the kind of thing we are seeing here with CAMAC is not about reform, it is not about efficiency, and it is not about deregulation; it is about getting rid of someone who provides frank and fearless advice. You do not just have to be Gillian Triggs in this country to feel the heat of a government that refuses to acknowledge frank and fearless advice. This is their modus operandi. Their modus operandi is to get rid of anyone who stands in their way by having independent thought and frank advice. In this case, it costs the economyâas has already been identified by the Law Council, who say that for every year that CAMAC has been in place, CAMAC has provided a substantive report that is well-thought through, and that can advance the case for reformâthat is every single year. And so, this is not a demonstration of efficiency; this is the most superior demonstration of cutting your nose off to spite your face. And it is all being done to save $1 million. Why would you do that? The argument advanced by coalition is: 'Well, we will just wrap them up into Treasury. We will be able to get this advice. When we consult with the private sector, they will give us this advice'âas if the private sector, and the type of talent that would drive the type of advice that CAMAC would normally provide, were just going to do it gratis. The idea that the private sector will be a charity to the federal government, and that they will just provide this advice for free is rubbish. They will not. They will, understandably, do what is in their own interests in advancing their own case, when they consult with Treasury in the future on the types of matters that would have been dealt with by CAMAC. But, if Treasury wants the type of advice that was once provided by CAMAC, they will not be getting it for free. They will have to pay for it. Imagine how much in consultants' feesâand we will be watching!âTreasury will be racking up to get this advice. And you know what? It is going to be more than $1 million in total.</span>

                    </a>  Exactly; as the member for Kingsford Smith rightly points out: they would probably get that for one report in one year. CAMAC, which is able to attract talented people from across business and academia who have done this work; CAMAC, which would sit within the government, will now be abolished. And as a result, we will now see this amount of money used to support, no doubt, a plethora of consultants' reportsâto support the work that CAMAC once did quite efficiently. It is simply bizarre. You cannot justify what is going on: here. It has been rightly pointed outâand this has been raised with the governmentâthat trying to replicate CAMAC's role within Treasury is going to be a hard ask. During the consultation process, the Governance Institute of Australia has said that: 'Treasury cannot replicate the independent research and stakeholder consultation undertaken by CAMAC due to its charter of responding to government policy.' So if you want CAMAC to provide the independent advice, and if you want people to give it in a frank and fearless way, and if you want them to do it in a way which provides a much more rigorous and robust way to determine policy, then you set them up as independent. You do not set them within Treasury. Everyone gets that when you set them within Treasury, they going to do what they believe is right for whoever is in power at whatever stage of government. They will do what Treasury does, and which it is their task and their responsibility to do, to provide advice in that way. CAMAC was deliberately set up in another way. These are the types of comments being madeâthe one that I have just quoted, and this one, also from the Governance Institute: 'We also are of the view that Treasury will not be able secure access to the calibre of expertise represented by the members of CAMAC in any ongoing and timely fashion or at comparable cost.' Again, I would respectfully say that for the $1 million you save now, you are going to pay way more for that type of advice down the track. It makes no sense. This is not about efficiency. This is not about making government work smarter.</span>

It will be compelled to. It cannot sustain itself by doing this within Treasury. In time, the corporate sector of this country will also want that to happenâbecause they will want to see independent advice being put forward. This is the insanity of what we are seeing right now. The other point I would make is in terms of the quality of CAMAC's work: I would commend, as many have done, the work that CAMAC has done in investigating a critical policy area that will drive innovation into the futureâthat is, the financing of innovation through a platform known as crowdsourced equity funding. They were tasked with this job by Labor when we were in government. They brought down their report in May of last year. The government, saying it would respond, delayed and delayed and has now put the reform process into hibernation, because, apparently, we will not see any legislation put before the House until Spring. The CAMC work in this area was widely recognised as being well researched and well thought out and it is something that is certainly worth discussing further.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  Yesterday I had the great fortune of attending Bare Island in our community to celebrate the first anniversary of the Black Markets. The Black Markets are an initiative of First Hand Solutions Aboriginal Corporation. They occur on the first Sunday in every month and raise money for Aboriginal community programs and youth at risk in our community. The setting for the Black Markets is the historic Bare Island. The markets include stalls, displays, cultural items and classes. Some of the classes include shell workshops, spear making, catch-and-cook programs, weaving for kids and history talks. The stall holders, many of whom are local Indigenous people, have a long connection with that very important land. The Timbery family, in particular, have been making and selling boomerangs in that area for over a hundred years and can date their family connection with that land back 7000 years. Other families include the Cann family and the famous snake man of La Perouse whose family are involved in some of the displays. Over the 12 months of the Black Markets, 18,000 people have visited the markets. Yesterday there was a smoking ceremony to mark the occasion. I congratulate Peter Cooley and Sarah Martin from First Hand Solutions for their wonderful work; the National Parks and Wildlife Service for making Bare Island available; and the wonderful volunteers who make the markets happen every month. Congratulations to the Black Markets.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  I welcomed the news last week that the federal government is to spend $4.2 million on infrastructure for the replacement of a number of bridges on main arterial roads across the state. The funding will make possible the much-needed upgrade to local bridges in my electorate of Lyons as part of the federal government's $300 million Bridges Renewal Program. I met with Northern Midlands Mayor David Downie at Westmoor Bridge on Powranna Road near Cressy to view the bridge which is one of those successful in what was a very competitive round. The Northern Midlands Council will receive $922,000 in federal funding towards the $1.8 million new bridge across the Macquarie river on the Powranna Road. The ongoing maintenance cost for the structures is significant. The replacement bridge on what has become a major connector road between the Midland Highway and the rapidly developing a group agricultural industry zone at the other end of the road near Cressy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The improved road infrastructure will help businesses like award-winning Tasmanian Quality Meats, Burlington Berries and Petuna Seafoods, as well as operations at the other end of the road such as the saleyards near the Midland Highway. A further $3.3 million of funding announced from the federal government's Bridges Renewal program for the Lyons electorate will go towards a $6.7 million state government project to replace two under-strength bridges on the Esk Main Road near Fingal and Avoca. It is part of $114 million round, the first of the rounds which are part of a total of $300 million commitment over five years for bridge renewal nationally.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  I rise to speak about a very exciting new venture in my electorate and congratulate the innovative local inventors. North Coast beekeepers Stuart and Cedar Anderson are set to take the honey world by storm after designing a revolutionary new honey collection system. The father and son inventors from The Channon came up with a system known as the Flow Hive, which does away with traditional bee smoking and instead allows honey to flow directly from the hive into containers without opening the hive or disturbing the bees. It is a great idea and it is already being dubbed the most important change in honey collection in 150 years and it is gathering a staggering amount of support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new system has attracted a worldwide following and netted more than $2 million on a crowdfunding website in just a few days, even though the pair had only initially asked for $70,000. Traditional extraction of honey is very time consuming and the Flow Hive saves almost all that time involved in honey extraction process. The invention could even help save declining bee populations around the world, because beekeepers will be able to keep more bees and new people will be able to enter the market. Stuart has said the new system makes it so easy to harvest honey could attract more peopleâincluding urban and suburban dwellersâto beekeeping. Cedar is overwhelmed at the response from the crowdfunding campaign. He said: 'We have been completely blown away by the support. We hope our invention will create a new community of beekeepers around the globe keeping bees in this new, bee-friendly way.' Congratulations to Stuart and Cedar, and all the best for the future; it is a great invention. I hope they do very well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  I wish to table a petition on behalf of Hinkler constituent Margaret Evans. It has been certified by the Petitions Committee as meeting all requirements. The petition contains 126 signatures and asks the House to waive the capital gains tax imposed on parents who gift property to their disabled children. The Evans family has expressed concern that any property gifted to a child with proven incurable and usually progressive medical conditions is still subject to capital gains tax. As it currently stands, gifting real estate to a family member results in the property transferring hands at market value, even if the parents have not received a cent. I understand their concern that most parents who are retiring do not have the means to pay the tax. They have worked hard to ensure their disabled child has a roof over their head when they are gone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if the child wanted to pay the tax on behalf of their parents, people with disabilities are typically ineligible for bank loans as they are unable to work. I understand capital gains requirements are largely dependent on individual circumstances, but I will not go into the Evans family's situation here today. However, I acknowledge the difficult situation they are in. Waiving such a tax would obviously have budgetary implications, but I wonder whether in such cases the rollover rules can apply, so that the tax is deferred until the disabled child sells the home. I congratulate Margaret and Leigh Evans on exercising their democratic right with this petition and I look forward to the minister's response.</span>

I attended a special celebration in the electorate on Saturday, 28 February, the last day of summerâa fitting day for us to pay tribute to our volunteer firefighters of the past 100 years. It was also national Red Balloon Day or 'Thank You to Fireys Day', which was apt. I joined Captain Michael Wells, the current officer in charge of the Werribee Fire Brigade, brigade members and life members and their families. Also attending were Euan Ferguson from the CFA AFSM and Lex Deman, the executive director of operational training and volunteerism. Firefighting in Wyndham has obviously been important across the 100 years. These volunteers over those periods have been involved in some horrendous fires including, of course, the Lara fires in 1969 and Black Saturday. My local CFA were also at the forefrontâin fact, they were groundbreakersâin motor vehicle rescue expertise. I was very proud to be there. I was very proud to present to them a chamber flag from this place to honour those firefighters and their families over such a long period of time.</span>

We have Mount Arapiles if you are an adventurous rock climber. Over Easter we have the Stawell Gift, one of the most famous bush races in the world. I will be there but I will not be racing, because I know where I would come. We have Horsham with wonderful places; the pioneer settlement in Swan Hill; Mildura with its great food, its paddle steamers, its day tours to Mungo National Park, its fine dining and its brewery. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  Small business is the engine room of our economy, and so important in rural and regional Australia to jobs, families and the prosperity of country communities. That is why our government has instituted the Harper review into competition policy. That is why we are fighting the petrol companies which are inflicting unfair fuel prices, or more correctly price gouging, in places like Colac. That is why we are tackling food labelling. That is why I am advocating new measures to combat price discrimination so that small businesses are not forced to the wall by the extraordinary market power, or the abuse of that market power, by the likes of the large supermarkets. We have seen some disgraceful unconscionable conduct from Coles making illegal demands for rebates from suppliers. I have been contacted about similarly unconscionable conduct from Woolworths. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to the Minister for Small Business, Bruce Billson, who has today announced a new Food and Grocery Code of Conduct to ensure fair and transparent commercial dealings between retailers, wholesalers and suppliers in the Australian grocery sector. The code will require minimum standards of behaviour when dealing with suppliers, a prohibition against threatening suppliers, and an obligation to enter into grocery supply agreements in writing. In contrast to the Labor Party, which was not prepared to tackle these hard issues, this is yet one more example of how we are standing up for small businesses, for family enterprises, for jobs and regional Australia.</span>

Specifically, it will commemorate 100 years of Anzac. </span>

I am pleased that the film festival will also welcome films in languages other than English in order to showcase the unique multicultural history of the Anzacs. By documenting these stories, we will ensure that our local and national Anzac history is remembered.</span>

In the morning I was with the Auburn City Council rededicating the war memorial as the kick-off to our Centenary of Anzac celebrations. The war memorial was built in 1922, and it has a particularly special place in Auburn because the mayor of Auburn was actually killed at Gallipoli. </span>

In 1982 the Turkish community had such numbers in Auburn that they built the Gallipoli mosque. It is the largest mosque in the Southern Hemisphere, and that shows you the strength of friendship that has developed over those 100 years. We originally went to Turkey in 1915 and faced off as enemies, and some 100 years later we sit in a suburb of Auburn and live as neighbours and friends. </span>

They raised vital funds that night. They will deliver an aged-care facilityâI have spoken in this House on the importance of multicultural aged care before. </span>

John Graham Brown has been awarded the title of Officer of the Order of Australia for his service to rural and regional economic development in Victoria. Perhaps better known for his service to the wine industry, John is a third-generation winemaker from Brown Brothers at Milawa. His roles there include chief winemaker, CEO and chairman of the board. He has also been foundation chair of Champions of the Bush, an organisation set up to encourage investment to deliver commercial returns to regional Australia. He is a founding member, the inaugural chair and now, proudly, patron of the Alpine Valleys Community Leadership Program. He has given over 50 years of service to the CFA. He is also inaugural chair of the Alpine Valleys Agribusiness Forum. June and John, I cannot think of a more wonderful and humbling role than to be your representative in this House. I thank you for what you have done. I acknowledge your role as leaders, community development people and business people in tourism, trade and exporting. June, I acknowledge you for your work as an artisan and craftswoman. It is fantastic. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Last week I had the great honour of taking over the role of chair of the Parliamentary Taiwan Friendship Group from the Hon. Karen Andrews, the member for McPherson, whom I thank for her dedicated work in cultivating relations with Taiwan. Taiwan is our seventh largest export market and our 11th largest trading partner. Last financial year Australia exported over $2.6 billion worth of coal, $1.7 billion worth of iron ore and concentrates and $230 million worth of beef to Taiwan. Taiwan exported telecommunications equipment, refined petroleum, bicycles, motorcycles and machinery to Australia. Each year, roughly 60,000 Australians visit Taiwan and nearly 50,000 Taiwanese tourists come to our shores. In addition, our education sector hosts around 8,000 exchange students from Taiwan and 35,000 Taiwanese youths enjoy living and working here via working holiday visas. As you can see, these facts show not only the strength of our economic and cultural ties with Taiwan but also how beneficial this relationship is to both our great nations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe I speak for both sides of the House when I express gratitude for Australia's close relationship with Taiwan. I take this opportunity to welcome the Taiwanese Ambassador, Dr David Lee, and his wife, Madame Lee, to Australia. Dr Lee's distinguished record of public service spans more than 20 years and by good fortune he is now Representative Ambassador of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Australia. I look forward to working with Dr Lee and all those involved in the Parliamentary Taiwan Friendship Group in deepening relations between Australia and Taiwan even further.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Just prior to Christmas last year the Abbott government slashed $270 million of funding from many of our most important front-line services. These are community organisations that provide critical services such as financial counselling, parenting programs, emergency relief, homelessness support and bushfire victim assistance to some of the most vulnerable Australians. Were it not for these organisations there would be even greater hardship and thus more demand on government assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the organisations that has been affected by the cuts is the Northern Community Legal Service, which provides financial counselling from its Modbury and Salisbury offices to people who find themselves in desperate situations. In the first six months of 2014 the organisation assisted some 400 families with financial advice. Financial counselling services provided by the Northern Community Legal Service are scheduled to cease at the end of June 2015 because the service has had its funding application rejected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cutting funds to this community organisation is yet another example of the short-sighted policies of the Abbott government, which hit the most vulnerable Australians the hardest. I call on the Abbott government to stop being so miserly, show some compassion and reverse these cuts.</span>

The Darwin Military Museum has received a grant of $27,000 to produce and distribute a book, including a teachers' guide, about those from the Northern Territory who served in the First World War. The Â Â Â Casuarina Secondary College has received a grant of $875 to assist them in conducting an Anzac 2015 commemorative week and service at the college. The Darwin RSL will receive a grant of $7,262 to correct the names on the First World War memorial at the Darwin Cenotaph. The Darwin Military Museum will also receive a grant of $5,275 to contribute towards the creation of a First World War display at the military museum. St Pauls Primary School will receive a grant of $2,333 to install an Anzac commemorative plaque and a flagpole to fly the Australian flag at the school. The Palmerston RSL will receive a grant of $18,583 to conduct an Anzac eve youth vigil in Palmerston. This will be the major Anzac commemorative activity in the Palmerston region this year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  Last Friday I had the pleasure of attending the opening of the 'Zel: Mind to Hand' art exhibition at the Curve Gallery in Newcastle. The exhibition celebrates the creative and colourful work of 88-year-old Zel Caddey, a truly remarkable woman who found her passion for art later in life. After being diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2011, Zel embraced the opportunity to express herself through the creation of vibrant and insightful artworks. This has continued beyond her ability to communicate verbally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Zel's style is characterised by an emphasis on narrative, colour and instinct. Her artworks capture a world full of friends, familiar places, memories and smiling faces. Zel's achievements are both inspiring and hopeful, with studies showing that art therapy can give back to Alzheimer's patients some of what the disease has taken away. By stimulating the senses, the experience of creating or enjoying a piece of art can awaken dormant memories and encourage conversationâwhether it be verbally or through the use of colour and form.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Curve Gallery, Alzheimer's Australia NSW and Zel's family and friends for supporting the exhibition, and the team at Hippocrates Aged Care facility in Mayfield who have enabled Zel to become their artist in residence. As our population ages and the number of families affected by Alzheimer's trebles to more than 900,000 over the next 35 years, the importance of investment into research and the support of diversional therapies such as art therapy to treat Alzheimer's cannot be understated. Aged care and dementia are very real issues facing older Australiansâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I spent time on Sunday morning at the Yeramba Lagoon site with many local residents who were helping out. Located at Picnic Point, Yeramba Lagoon was originally a tidal saltwater lagoon. But with the building of Henry Lawson Drive in 1964, it actually caused a weir across the tidal flow. Now, after many years, it has actually turned into a freshwater lagoon and has become infested by many non-native and noxious weeds. All hope is not lost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The large and enthusiastic turnout on Sunday demonstrated there is very strong support for cleaning up Yeramba Lagoon and turning it back into the wonderful nature area that it previously was, where families could go picnicking and enjoying a canoe ride. I was proud to be in attendance with the state member for East Hills, Mr Glenn Brookes. Together, we worked hard to put together the case for the Green Army to become involved in cleaning up Yeramba Lagoon. I will continue to fight here in Canberra for funding for Yeramba Lagoon for the Green Army to get out on the ground and to make a major improvement. I also congratulate Nick Bloukos and everyone who participated in Clean Up Australia Day at Yeramba Lagoon or at any one of the 7,000 sites around Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  On too many occasions over my last 10 years in this House, I have had to rise to report atrocities against the Assyrian people in the Middle East. Again, I have to say that the situation has worsened, not gotten better. The people of Assyrian background have been great suffers since the fall of Hussein<span class="HPS-st1" style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Arial;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;    color:#545454;&#xD;&#xA;  "></span>more than 10 years ago. Just in the recent weeks, on 23 February, 35 Assyrian villages stretching over 80 kilometres west from Al-Hasakah Province to Ra's al-'Ayn on the Khabur River in north-east Syria have been attacked. Daesh attacks Assyrians in Syria and Iraq. Of course, we do not know exactly how many people have been killed. We do know that at least 15 Assyrian guards were killed defending their villages. Up to 373 Assyrians, mainly women and children, were captured by Daesh. We can only shudder at their likely fate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Daesh is engaging on a program of killing the Assyrian ancient and noble culture, taking artefacts and destroying them. Already, 118 churches in Iraq and six in Syria have been burnt down, and ancient manuscripts of the ancient churches have been destroyed by Daesh. When Daesh is eventually defeated, the world must ensure that that opportunity is taken to ensure a protected homeland for the Assyrian people. This great and ancient civilisation, and the many thousands of Assyrians around the world, deserve nothing less.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  It is always great to rise in this place and celebrate the wonderful game of footballâthe world game. It is interesting to note that the latest ABS data show that nearly three times as many Australians play the world game than do Australian rules. As a parliamentary co-convener with my good friend the member for Moreton of the Parliamentary Friends of Football Australia, our focus is continuing to build people's awareness of the great game here on the hill. I have also recently stepped back into the game and have now the joy of playing football at Loganholme football club with my two sons.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, when you look at sport overall we see a decline in the number of people participating in sport. For the youth in our community, when we are suffering health effects from obesity and other things, I think it is important that we continue to have more and more people play various sports. One of our great local businesses is one of our great local gymsâGlobal Gym 24/7 in Loganholme. Christo and the team there are placing a huge focus on getting people fit and involved in an active lifestyle. They have recently donated 30 free memberships and 30 free entries to their 12-week challenge. I welcome their commitment to improving the overall health of people in our community and look forward to hearing back about the results. No doubt their efforts will have a positive effect. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  I rise today to tell House that I am proud that the Bendigo Spirit, our great basketball team, will again be in the grand final against the Townsville Fire. I have news for the member for Herbert: the Bendigo Spirit will make it three in a row. We will be three times winners of the WNBL championship. It was great to be there at the game yesterday. The House should note that the game was being broadcast on ABC. Fans of Sydney Uni could watch the game live on ABC. This weekend, when the Spirit go up against the member for Herbert's team, Townsville, and when the Spirit are victorious again, we will get to watch the game live on ABC.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, however, it will be the last WNBL game to be broadcast by the ABC. Funding cuts to the ABC mean that the WNBL will not be broadcast for 2015-16, ending a 35-year relationship between the WNBL and the ABC. It is an absolute disgrace that this government has brought about the result of an end of funding to broadcasting women's elite sport. I call on the government this weekend to stand by the WNBL and restore the funding so that next year the member for Herbert can watch the Bendigo Spirit again be victorious over Townsville.</span>

I refer to Labor's plan today to make multinational corporations pay their fair share of tax. Given this plan would raise more than double what the Prime Minister's unfair GP tax would raise, why is the Prime Minister still slugging Australians with his unfair GP tax rather than making multinational corporations pay their fair share?</span>

If they want to talk about measures that would help the revenue, what about supporting in opposition the changes that members opposite proposed in government? Labor can talk all they like now, but they do not have much of a record. When it comes to tax, there were some 100 measures that had been proposed but not implemented by members opposite.</span>

Prior to the election we promised to improve relationships in this vital sector and that is exactly what this code of conduct will do. Hard bargaining is expected in all areas of business, but unfair practices should not occur, particularly in a sector which is dominated by some very big businesses. That is why we do need the code of conduct which the Minister for Small Business has announced today. I do want to make it very clear that as far as the government is concerned the big supermarkets of Australia are great businesses. They are world-class businesses that have helped to deliver quality products at competitive prices to Australian consumers. Woolworth and Coles are big businesses because they are good businesses. They are businesses that strive to be ethical as well as simply successful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we do not just need world-class retailers. We also need world-class producers and suppliers too, and the big supermarkets need their suppliers just as much as they need their customers. It is important that suppliers get a fair go, just as it is important that consumers get a fair go, and that is exactly what this code of conduct is designed to ensure. It is designed to ensure fair competition between big businesses and their smaller business suppliers in the grocery sector. It is designed to ensure that big businesses cannot use their market power capriciously or arbitrarily against their smaller business suppliers. Now I do stress that I do not think that this happens very often. But it should never happen, and henceforth the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, will be there as the friend of fairness in the supply line as well as in the supermarket itself. This is yet another example of how this government is getting on with the job of doing the right thing by the people of Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:07</span>):  I was wondering where Labor was getting all its information, and I was thinking to myself: where would they have gone to write a policy?âbecause obviously they did not do it themselves. The member for McMahon, who is not known to be an expert on tax, as we all know, in his press conference said, 'What we've done is adjusted new advice, international best practice, and of course we went to our former Assistant Treasurer, who was working with the OECD in Paris.' That would be the former Assistant Treasurer who put a note out to his electorate saying that the budget was in surplus, on time as promised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But hang on: I do not want to be too tough on the member for McMahon, because he did accuse us, he did say that it is important not to have policy on the run. I embrace this newfound commitment to tax reform from Labor, having got the mining tax wrong, having got the carbon tax wrong, and having got thin-capitalisation rules wrong previously. I welcome Labor's newfound embrace of taxation reform. The member for McMahon says, 'Will you work with us?' Of course we will work with you; absolutely. And I would say this to the member for McMahon: please give us all the working papers on this proposal, because I asked the Treasury, before I came here, 'What does this mean?' And the advice of Treasury was that the proposal in relation to thin capitalisation will cost Australian jobs. That was the advice of the Treasury.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, why would the Treasury say that it will cost Australian jobs? I will tell you why. Because what happens at the moment, which the opposition does not understand, is that shareholders expect on their equity investments a better return than the cost of debt. Equity actually costs more than debt. And Labor is saying that it wants to penalise international companies that lend to their Australian operations to expand their operations. They want to penalise those companies that have used borrowings to expand their operations in Australia, and they want them to put up more capital. Well, I will tell you what. That will cost jobs. That will cost jobs at Unilever. That will cost jobs at Shell. That will cost jobs at McDonald's. That will cost jobs at IBM. That will cost Australian jobs, because if you make it more expensive for international businesses to operate in Australia, they will simply reduce their operations, as we have seen with car manufacturing companies.</span>

We have enacted the country's first food and grocery code of conduct. At the election we said we would work with industry to get this done, and that is exactly what has happened. For many years, even over the Labor years, we heard time and time again about the significant concern that was there in the food and grocery supply chains in relation to commercial dealings that they had with big retailers whereby small grocery suppliers frankly felt that they could not push their case and were getting pushed around and forced into situations against their own economic self-interest. We have seen the case studies and we have seen the legal action, where dominant retailers have engaged in conduct that crosses the line from hard bargaining into an area where those dealings are not fair, are not reasonable and are not showing respect for their supply chain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This harms consumers, as it harms suppliers. It harms consumers because if a small supplier cannot be confident of the ground that they are operating under and can be subject to unilateral claims, then where is the incentive for them to invest? Where is the encouragement for product innovation? And that is what leads consumers to be disadvantaged. To its credit, though, the food and grocery industry has recognised a need for action in this area. They got together, they worked through the issues and they were up-front about each other's approach to commercial dealings, understanding that this government was insistent on progress being achieved on this front. And what have we done? We have delivered. As the Food and Grocery Council said today. 'This is a historic day'. It added:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian Dairy Farmers has praised the code, saying that it is 'a positive first step towards addressing the imbalance in market power between retailers and suppliers'. And ALDI Australia has welcomed the government's finalisation of the food and grocery code and announced that it will be signing up as a party to the codeâgreat leadership from ALDI.</span>

In 2007, Labor promised it would protect small suppliers through codes and hold a national grocery pricing inquiry. Well, it should not come as any surprise to anybody: lots of Labor talk, no Labor action over six years. Instead, all we got was the Grocery Choice website. What happened with that? Even Labor realised that that was a dud. In contrast, we have got on with it, we have delivered, making sure that this is a good economy for big and small businesses. It is a good day. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We absolutely want Medicare to be safe and secure for the long term, and that is exactly why the Minister for Health is having ongoing discussions with the profession, and that is why the government will have more to say in due course. But the simple fact that members opposite need to be aware of is that a decade ago Medicare was costing us $8 billion a year. Today it is costing us $20 billion a year and a decade hence it will cost us $34 billion a year. So we must always be taking sensible measures to ensure that Medicare is strong and sustainable. But it is very important that those measures protect bulk-billing for the vulnerable and that is always what you will get from this government.</span>

I thank her for inviting me to her electorate recently where we met with a range of business people who were very supportive of the construction of Badgerys Creek Airport. They were absolutely determined to create more jobs and more opportunities for all the people of western Sydney, but for those particularly in and around Badgerys Creek Airport as a result of this government's commitment to get on with the job of constructing the airport but also investing $2.8 billion in the roads around there, up-front and immediately. This is what it is about; it is about creating jobs. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Residential construction work done in the December quarter indicates that residential construction activity in New South Wales was nearly 20 per cent higher over the 12 months to the end of last year.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014 business investment in the services sector of our economy hit a record high of $62 billion, the strongest calendar year gain in seven years. I might add that services represent around 70 per cent of our economy. So as the massive investment in mining infrastructure and new resources projects comes off, as was expected under the previous government and as is expected under us, we have got to fire up the rest of the economy, particularly in services. Now that we have got record levels of investment in services, that means we have got record opportunities to grow the economy. Do you know what is the best thing we can do for the services sector? Build new markets because, whilst it represents around 70 per cent of the Australian economy, it represents around 20 per cent of our exports. So if we can lift services exports in a range of different fields, health care, education and IT and ensure they are on the same path and in the same ratio as it relates to the Australian economy, we are going to see billions of dollars flood into the Australian economy and tens of thousands of new jobs. That comes about because we expand the market. We have already got the strong base in the services sector. Now we have to expand the market, getting aged-care services into China, getting health and education services into Korea and getting into a range of services exports in Japan. This is what we are delivering now and it will end up in delivering more jobs for Australians and greater prosperity.</span>

And they have said that they will cancel stage 3 of WestConnex. The New South Wales Labor Party, having presided over 16 years of stagnation, now want to take New South Wales backwards. I am very pleased to be working hand in glove with the New South Wales Premier, Mike Baird. I am very happy to be standing shoulder to shoulder with Mike Baird, as I was just nine days ago in Sydney. Together, the New South Wales coalition government and the Commonwealth coalition government will set up New South Wales for a great future.</span>

Before the next federal election, 55,000 jobs in motor vehicle construction will vanish, 20,000 in the coal seam gas industry, 15,000 in the coal industry and 3,000 in the sugar industry. On the three-for-one rule 300,000 jobs will vanish. Would the PM address the reconstructing task force's government purchasing policy proposals and consider financial guarantees enabling superannuation investment into the Galilee rail line and the UBURIS irrigation project proposals, creating 70,000 jobs?</span>

I just do not share his despair and his pessimism about the Australian economy. I know that we can expect a contraction in the motor industry. I know that. But there are many, many businesses in the motor industry that will continue because Australians will keep driving cars and the world will keep making cars. And Australian businesses will continue to contribute to making cars right around the world.</span>

That will be good for employment in the coal sector and it will be good for employment in the resources sector. I know that sugar has certainly had its difficulties in recent times, but right now sugar is in a reasonable state. My intention is to try to ensure that through ongoing free trade negotiations, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, we do a better deal for the sugar producers of Australia. We know members opposite were not able to do it, but we are determined to ensure that we get the best possible deal for the sugar producers of Australia, particularly the sugar producers of Queensland.</span>

Job creation in 2014 was three times the job creation in the last year of the Labor government. That is what you get when you have a government which delivers for business, which delivers lower tax, which delivers less regulation and which actually takes business seriously. That is what we doâwe take business seriously. We are open for business, and that is why employment in this country should improve in the weeks and months and years ahead.</span>

As the member for Ryan knows and as the people of Brisbane know, and as the people of Queensland and the people of Australia know, it is vitally important that we as a nation live within our means. This Thursday we will be releasing the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational report</span>, which will illustrate what are believed to be the demographics of the next 40 years of Australia. And it is exciting. It is exciting that we should live longerâwe all want to live longer, and we also want to have a decent quality of life along the way. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HOCKEY:</span>
                  </a>  Well, some people in the Labor Party obviously struggle with the thought of living longer, and I suggest that some of their constituents might have that view about them as well. The fact is that we are living longer and we want to have a good quality of life. Importantly, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational report</span> represents a compact between the generations. It is an agreement between grandparents and parents, between children and grandchildren and our generation to ensure that we can afford the future, that we can pay for the health care, the aged care and the education and all the things we desperately need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The starting point has to be right here and now. We need to start living within our means. As a result of the legacy of Labor, we were left with a daily debt that accrued at over $100 million a day. So every single day, as a result of Labor's actions, we had to borrow $100 million just to pay the daily bills as a government. That is clearly not sustainable. If the government have to keep borrowing $100 million a day just to pay the daily billsâand a large chunk of that has to come from people living overseas who are lending us the moneyâsooner or later we end up with debt levels that allow the bankers of the world to be in control of our destiny rather than for us to be in control of our destiny.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the solution? The solution is that we need to be able to get on with the job of fixing the mess that Labor created. And we have gone a long way.</span>

                  </a>  As the <span style="font-style:italic;">IGR</span> will illustrate, we have come a long way along the path of fixing Labor's mess, but there is still much work to be done. We have not finished, because ultimately we have got to get the balance right. We have got to have a credible plan to get the budget back to surplus so that we as a nation can start to live within out means. At the same time, we need to be able to create an environment where business, and small business in particular, has the confidence to go out and employ more Australians. You cannot buy prosperity, but you can buy a better budget. And that is why Australians invest in the Liberal Party.</span>

The alternative to the government's program is to bring back 'Moscow on the Molonglo', which used to exist in this country when ministers and bureaucrats decided on how many students there were in courses and how many students there were in universities. 'Moscow on the Molonglo' was always what Kim Carr wanted. He never supported Julia Gillard's far-reaching reforms to bring in a demand driven system. Last year, on 9 October, Senator Carr said:</span>

It would mean bringing back the caps, which would force low-SES students out of university. Ironically, this side of the House wants more first-generation university goers and low-SES students to go to uni.

The government are committed to doing all we can to prevent Australians from providing any support at all for Daesh's barbaric and destructive acts. Today, under provisions in our new foreign fighters legislation, I have declared Mosul district in Iraq an area where a listed terrorist organisation engaging in hostile activity has replaced the legitimate government and is effectively in control. Mosul has strategic and symbolic significance to Daesh. This city is the largest controlled by Daesh in Iraq. It has about 700,000 people. It plays a key role as a location for foreign terrorist fighters to form networks and to train.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is now an offence under Australian law for any Australian to enter or remain in Mosul or district without a legitimate purpose. Anyone who does so faces a penalty of up to 10 years imprisonment. Since taking control of Mosul last year, Daesh has directed its terrorist activities from this district. It has used terrorist attacks extensively against civilians, carrying out mass executions and beheadings. Recent atrocities include: the crucifixion of 17 young men; the death of a woman by stoning; the public execution of 13 teenage boys whose crime, allegedly, was watching an Asian Cup soccer match. These madmen are seeking to take the world back to the dark ages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adding to the carnage, footage was released last week of Daesh fighters destroying ancient artefacts in Mosul. These thugs were using sledgehammers to wantonly destroy priceless cultural heritage items dating back thousands of years. It was reminiscent of the Taliban's destruction of ancient Buddhist statues in Afghanistan in 2001, eerily in that period leading up to the attacks on the World Trade Centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These utterly uncivilised acts are being universally condemned. The United Nations has called for urgent action by the Security Council, as this type of cultural destruction only further fuels extremism and promotes further conflict in Iraq.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My listing, today, of a no-go zone in Iraq, in addition to the listing of Ar-Raqqah in Syria, last December, will help our law enforcement agencies bring to justice those who have committed serious terrorist offences. This includes associating with and fighting for terrorist organisations, which is adding to the death and destruction in Syria and Iraq, and risking the lives of the Australians who are going there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our declaration of Mosul as a terrorist no-go zone is another significant step in combating Daesh to starve it of foreign fighters. We will do what we can to keep our people safe.</span>

They have set you up with that question, because this guy over here cut thousands of jobs out of the Australian Taxation Office.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will tell you something. The fact is that we are the ones who are actually doing something about inappropriate activities by multinationals. We have taken a multipronged approach. Number one, Labor had 96 announced but unlegislated taxation measures. We cleaned them out, and where they could be implemented, we did implement them, particularly in relation to this thin-capitalisation rules. The Deputy Secretary of the Treasury said, before the Senate estimates, that the coalition government has implemented the policies; what the previous government proposed was un-implementable. It was un-implementable, with massive unintended consequences for Australian corporates that wanted to expand offshore. So, we are the ones that actually made the hard decisions and delivered the hard decisions in relation to the thin-capitalisation rules.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor announced that they were going to crack down on the 25 largest companies in Australia with a turnover in excess of $20 million that were taking advantage of the R&amp;D process. They never legislated for this. We came into government and said that this was an appropriate thing to do. We introduced the legislation, and Labor voted against it. Labor voted against their own tax integrity measures. They have the hide to come in here and give us a lecture about tax integrity when they are voting in favour of larger businesses against small business; when they are in voting in favour of getting the rorters an even break, rather than supporting us in our campaign to make sure that multinationals that are not paying their fair share of tax are brought to account. Through the G10 attendance with this Prime Minister, through the OECD with our combined effort, through our own legislation, and through our policy announcements, we want to make sure everyone pays their fair share of tax. Sadly, the Labor Party does not.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Justice</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:44</span>):  I thank the member for Barton for that questionâa hardworking member who hosted me in his electorate this morning at Al Zahra College, which is in receipt of $167,000 from the government's Schools Security Program. We want parents who send their kids to school to be focused on the education of those kids, not worrying about their safety. Prior to the election, we made a commitment to continue the Schools Security Program with a boost of $18 million. This $18 million will fund 54 at-risk schools, who will share in this funding: 11 independent schools, 11 government schools, 17 Jewish schools and 15 Islamic schools. For the first time under this program, this money can be used to employ security guards as well as for the installation of security infrastructure, such as CCTV, security lighting and fencing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, after we came to office, I wrote to all the state and territory education ministers and the Independent Schools Council, asking them for nominations of at-risk schools and preschools. My department then contacted those nominated schools and preschools and invited them to apply for this funding. We also then provided those schools with assistance to apply for this funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make it very clear to this House and to the community that this funding is not being committed in response to any particular threat. There is no particular threat that the government is aware of. This funding is recognition that some schools have a higher-risk profile and therefore they have higher security needs. We want to make sure that our schools' primary focus is on student education and that every student has the right to come to school each day knowing that they will be taught in a safe and secure learning environment. This program is about ensuring that schools do not have to divert funding from education priorities, or impose higher costs on parents, to ensure that their students can be taught in a safe and secure environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, it would be better that we lived at a time when we did not need to have programs such as this. But, whilst we have a heightened security environment, the schools that are assessed as being at higher risk for whatever reasonâbe it the background of their students, be it their locationâcan expect that their federal government will join with the state and territory governments to provide the extra security that those school communities need, and I was very pleased to be at Al Zahra College with the member for Barton this morning, doing exactly that.</span>

We are absolutely determined to protect and sustain our great Medicare system. For four years as health minister I protected and sustained Medicare, as its best friend; and as Prime Minister I say we will protect and sustain our great Medicare systemâa system which looks after Australians, which particularly looks after vulnerable Australians. We will protect bulk-billing for vulnerable Australians; and, to that end, the Minister for Health is continuing to have discussions with the medical profession. That is what you would expect. We want to work constructively with the medical profession and other health professionals to make a good system even better.</span>

In 2007, there were four people in detention, including no childrenâno children in detention in 2007. Yet, at the peak of Labor's power, there were 1,992, almost 2,000, children in detention, 8,000 people having come by boat. They had completely lost control of the borders, and all Australians know that you cannot trust a government that cannot control its borders.</span>

We know that, in 12 months under Labor, before they were tossed out, there were 302 boats. Indeed, over Labor's time in power, 50,000 people came on 800 boats. It was a nationalâin fact, an internationalâdisgrace, because not only did it result in an $11 billion blow-out in the budget in this area but it also resulted in 1,200 people drowning at sea. Labor should hang their heads in shame. So the Australian public knows that you cannot trust a government that loses control of its borders, and the now Leader of the Opposition sat in cabinet during all that period, presiding over 11 different policy changes that resulted in peopleâ</span>

As of today, 114 children are held in detention in Australia, the number reducing every day, compared to 1,992 children in detention under Labor.

You can do nothing better than to quote ministers in this government. I applaud the Leader of the Opposition for quoting ministers in this government, particularly the Minister for Communications, who put it very well. All ministers in this government support the measures put forward by this government. The measures put forward by this government are good measures.</span>

Just in the last fortnight, we have finally delivered some certainty that Australia will get the submarines that we need, after Labor sat on its hands for six years. We have ended the dam-phobia in this country by getting on with the job of building water storages in Tasmania. That is just the start. We are doing the right thing by the pensioners of this country with changes to the deeming rate and by scrapping the carbon tax, but keeping the compensation.</span>

That is something that that sector has been crying out for for years. In Labor's wilderness years, they cried out, 'Give us something that will enable us to get a fair go and that will enable us to have a level playing field.' That is exactly what the grocery sector now has. Every day, we will do the right thing by the people of Australia. Every day, we will get on with the job.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Theirs was an experience felt right across New South Wales and Australia. In New South Wales alone, the electricity bills over the two years of the carbon tax amounted to $2 billion. That was $2 billion in higher electricity prices. For firms, what we saw when it was abolished was a reduction of up to nine per cent in their electricity prices. For households, it was a reduction of up to 10 per cent. To go back to what the proprietors said in their email to the member for Robertson, I again quote: 'I implore you to fight against any reintroduction of a tax, levy or carbon trading scheme which will increase our electricity charges again.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings us to the question of a threat. There is a plan to bring back a massive new electricity tax. It is not ours; it is theirs. No good question time is complete without a quote from the great wordsmith, the member for Fraser. The member for Fraser, as we know, is a prolific author. He recently had an article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> about the carbon tax. What was it that the member for Fraser said? I quote the headline from 27 January of this year: 'Pining for the good old carbon tax' by Andrew Leigh. He did not just plan and he was not even yearning; he was pining.

The Attorney General is a stalwart defender of free speech in this country, but he also wants to ensure that free speech is not abused. And that is absolutely the right thing. We want people to be free to speak their mind, but we do not want them to be free to promote the sorts of activities that will be a menace to this country and its citizens. I trust the Attorney General to get that particular balance right. The Attorney-General is, in fact, the chief security officer of our country. He is the first law officer of the Crown, and he is the chief security officer of our country.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  by leaveâThe Australian Defence Force, ADF, has been involved in continuous operations for almost 16 years, and as I speak our Defence Force has once more been deployed to a foreign theatre in support of our national interest. Whether as part of global coalitions, supporting regional partners or assisting Australians and others in times of need, the last 16 years has borne witness to an ADF that has grown and developed in a multitude of ways. New equipment, new infrastructure, new doctrine and new attitudes on the battlefield have all shaped the ADF into the organisation we have come to know today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most defining feature of the current Defence Force is not its equipment or its bases; it is the extraordinary professionalism and courage, both moral and physical, of its people. To their enduring credit our people continue to change attitudes and behaviours; to adapt to the challenges that befall them and leverage the tremendous benefits that accompany the diversification of the ADF workforce. This is exemplified in Defence's <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="" target="_self">Pathway to Change: Evolving Defence Culture</a> strategy that was released on 7 March 2012. Pathway to Change is Defence's statement of cultural intent and builds on the cultural reform programs underway in the three services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, Pathway to Change articulates Defence's cultural intent; <span style="color:gray;">that we are trusted to defend, proven to deliver and respectful always</span>. The government remains committed to Pathway to Change and especially to building a culture of respect within the ADF. My edict is a simple oneâeveryone serves, everyone fights and everyone is respected regardless of their gender, religion, ethnicity or sexuality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The combat power the ADF generates in order to serve the national interest is magnified when all of our people respect the person they fight alongside, knowing that person is qualified and trained for their role. Pathway to Change shows clearly, for example, that the ADF's combat power is enhanced by having more women and Indigenous Australians in our ranks. To this end the government remains committed to the current recruitment diversity strategy with its specific focus on women and Indigenous Australians. The results over the last 12 months have been encouraging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next iteration on the ADF's journey to enhance its combat power is to more fully embrace a culturally and linguistically diverse, CALD, workforce. And it is to this end that this ministerial statement will focus. By way of background, as a nation, 26 per cent of our population were born overseas and a further 20 per cent have at least one overseas-born parent. Yet only 5.7 per cent of permanent Defence Force members currently identify themselves as being from a 'non-English speaking background'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of pure numbers, within our 57,000-strong permanent ADF, only 3,262 members identify themselves as being from a non-English speaking background. A further examination of the composition of the ADF reveals 12.4 per cent, or 7,126 members of the permanent force, were born outside of Australia. But perhaps more critically only 5.4 per cent, or 3,110, were born in countries other than New Zealand, the United States, Canada or the United Kingdom. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that Defence has not been standing still on this issue. The latest recruitment data shows an increase in the number of people enlisting who are born in countries other than Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, New Zealand and Canada. However the increase has only been 0.2 per cent over the last 12 months. It is clear the growth of a culturally and linguistically diverse workforce, that represents the changing face of modern Australia, is moving too slowly. This is going to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's direction to the Department of Defence is quite clear. It is to renew efforts on recruiting and developing a larger, more representative culturally and linguistically diverse workforce. This is to start now. There is to be a dedicated recruitment strategy to ensure the ADF has access to the nation's full potential and recruits from it accordingly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This strategy is not born out of a desire to be seen to be doing something, or a belief in social engineering. It is born out of the stark reality that combat power will be enhanced by widening the national recruitment pool and tapping into the tremendous latent resources that a culturally and linguistically diverse workforce brings to Defence. In many ways this is not dissimilar from ensuring our capability edge through investing in cutting edge equipment or maintaining exceptional training standards. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This new approach, which I term capability through diversity, will ensure we tap into the nation's full recruitment potential to ensure we are able to support the generation and sustainment of combat power into the future. Furthermore, Defence can and will take growing advantage of the national depth of cultural diversity to develop a breadth of cultural and linguistic knowledge and expertise that enhances the ADF's war fighting capability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A more diverse workforce will further assist Defence engage closely with key international partnersâincluding the United Nations, NATO, ASEAN, and other non-government and independent organisations with an international focus. Likewise, in order to ensure Australia's security in the Asia-Pacific, Defence must have personnel with sufficient depth of linguistic and cultural literacy to engage effectively with our regional neighbours and partners.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As modern military operations evolve there will be a growing requirement for greater interaction with, and understanding of, different cultures. It will be essential to increase the ADF's cultural diversity and cultural competence if it is to harness the advantage on the modern battlefield, on operations and at home assisting Australians in times of need. Take for example the female engagement teams in Uruzgan province. They built relationships with Afghan women to allow them to express their concerns and needs to improve their lives and those of their families in a safe, sensitive and culturally appropriate manner. This capability was vital in accessing a significant part of the Afghan population and unequivocally demonstrated that a diverse ADF workforce had a tangible battlefield advantage in Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are numerous contemporary examples of where diversity has proven to be operationally essential, and they include:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To expand on these successes and ensure the future capability of the ADF, it is crucial to increase the accessible talent pool from which the ADF can recruit individuals with a culturally and linguistically diverse background. A recent article on religious diversity by Lieutenant Colonel Hoglin, published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Army Journal</span> Culture edition 2013 identified the need to: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ gain a deeper and more intimate cultural understanding and appreciation of local populations in likely areas of operations, including religious sensitivities and practices (beyond that possible through cultural awareness training during force preparation).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The article further identified that diversity:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ enhances the effectiveness of domestic disaster relief programs through consideration of religious customs, traditions and immediate faith-related needs in affected areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe Lieutenant Colonel Hoglin is absolutely correct. To ensure Defence can effectively widen its culturally and linguistically diverse workforce, it must ensure its recruitment practices and wider policies are not limiting access to quality candidates from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. It must also ensure its internal policies and practices are sensitive to a broad range of cultural needs. This will assist in developing a deeper culture of inclusivity to support our retention goals, and so that each person can optimally contribute to Australia's defence through their skills, education, knowledge and ideas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In meeting these objectives of the capability through diversity program, Defence, it is fair to say, will need to overcome some community challenges. After all, culturally and linguistically diverse communities are not homogenous. For example, overcoming eligibility requirements to serve in the ADF and appealing to those communities who have traditionally had less propensity or interest in military service will need to be addressed. I am confident Defence can and will overcome most challenges associated with attracting people from different cultural experiences and backgrounds. In fact research suggests that specialised approaches to marketing, particularly to target the 'influencers', are important to attract or overcome propensity issues for different communities. These influencers may be parents, community leaders or teachers for instance.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A good example of a specialised approach is the establishment of the Navy cadet unit in Western Sydneyâ'TS Australia'. Cadet units have traditionally been a strong recruitment pool for the ADF. In this case the membership of this unit reflects the cultural make-up of the community in which it operates, which is predominantly Islamic. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All Australians, regardless of their cultural or linguistic background should feel comfortable serving in our world-class Defence Force. Our Defence leaders are taking steps to ensure they have the best cultural advice. The Chief of Navy's recent steps to employ an Islamic adviser within the Navy is a case in point. Furthermore, Australians should feel secure in the knowledge that our Defence Force represents our pluralist democracy. There is no impediment to service based on religion, and our chaplaincy and religious advisory committee to the services are designed to provide such support where required. To this end, I have asked my department to move as quickly as possible to identify a part-time Islamic imam to join the ADF's religious advisory committee to ensure those 96 ADF members of an Islamic faith have appropriate representation. Likewise if other mainstream faith groups have approximately 100 adherents serving in the ranks of the ADF, the same opportunity will be provided for their religious leaders to represent them on the religious advisory committee. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as the ADF will require a greater talent pool of culturally and linguistically diverse personnel to ensure future operational success, so too will it require a diverse workforce to ensure that it remains technologically proficient. The future ADF will need a workforce highly literate in science, technology, engineering and mathematical (STEM) skills, skills that are in demand right across the economy. Employment in these occupations is growing at almost twice the pace of other occupations and the employment rates for those with these skills are extremely highâabove 80 per cent. Australia, like other countries, is facing challenges in accessing STEM skills. If Defence wants to ensure it maintains and grows its STEM capability, it must attract candidates from the broadest range of educational and ethnic backgrounds in the community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent data indicates about a quarter of Australia's overseas-born, higher education student population is born in China (19 per cent) or India (six per cent), with a further 16 per cent born in Europe and 13 per cent born in Africa and the Middle East. Of those born outside Australia, with higher level STEM qualifications, 10 per cent were born in India and seven per cent in China.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A 2013 report <span style="font-style:italic;">STEM:</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Country c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">omparisons</span>, states that migrant families do better in Australia than in most OECD countries and that young people born in Australia to immigrant parents are the highest achieving group in Australia. This data indicates increasing representation of culturally and linguistically diverse personnel is a capability multiplier. It not only improves cultural competence and capability, but may increase access to a greater proportion of our talented youth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australian employers are struggling to recruit those with STEM aptitudes in sufficient numbers, and tend to be focusing on making STEM pathways more attractive to women. With some targeted efforts to recruit those with linguistic and cultural diversity, Defence will get ahead of the curve in terms of recruiting those with a propensity to work in STEM-related fields. Indeed, a vibrant cultural capacity and aptitude in science and technology is pivotal to our future capability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, the capability through diversity program will better align the composition of the ADF with the broader community. However; this should not be seen as an end in itself; rather, the objective is to increase the ADF's operational capability. Having a culturally diverse ADF does not just benefit the Australian community, it provides a strategic deterrent and battlefield advantage. These advantages would only be enhanced by an increased focus on the recruitment of Australians from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past few years we have focused on increasing the participation of women in the ADF. Gender equality in the ADF is now being rapidly accepted as fact by the community. Capability through diversity is the next iteration, with its focus on attracting those from a range of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Defence must be ahead of the national game. The ADF must further diversify and better reflect the society it serves and represents in order to be competitive in the employment market and to draw on the wider range of skills and experience central to our national security objectives. The generation of our nation's combat power options deserves nothing less.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:32</span>):  I welcome the statement by the Assistant Minister for Defence on capability through diversity, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond. When we talk about our defence capability we often focus on the technology, the hardware, the systems and the infrastructure. But I do not think there is a person in this place who would not agree that, when it comes to capability, our single biggest asset is our peopleâthe men and women of the Australian Defence Force. It is their courage, their dedication and their bravery that make our Defence Force what it is, so it is vital that we as policy makers do all we can to attract the best people to the ADF and to provide them with the support they need throughout their career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both sides of government can be proud of the work that has been done in recent years to increase flexibility, inclusivity and diversity within the ADFâinitiatives such as Project Suakin, which is delivering an enhanced employment model for the ADF by providing consistent access to a range of flexible career options; Plan Beersheba, which is increasing the integration between full- and part-time soldiers; the Broderick review and the Pathway to Change strategy, which have explored employment pathways for women and implemented measures to promote gender equality in Defence; and the ADF's Indigenous Employment Strategy. These initiatives are recognition of the fact that flexibility, inclusivity and diversity are each crucial to Defence's ability to operate at peak performance and demonstrate maximum capability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we have come a long way, there is still work to be done, and so I welcome the assistant minister's statement on capability through diversity, which focuses on recruiting and developing a larger and more representative culturally and linguistically diverse workforce. Our defence forces should reflect the diversity within our society. Through diversity Australia gains the varied perspectives needed to face complex problems. As the assistant minister said, 26 per cent of our population was born overseas and a further 20 per cent have at least one overseas born parent. Yet only 12.4 per cent of our ADF personnel were born outside of Australia. In her introduction to the white paper <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia in the Asian Century</span>, former Prime Minister Julia Gillard said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Predicting the future is fraught with risk, but the greater risk is in failing to plan for our destiny. As a nation, we face a choice: to drift into our future or to actively shape it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was of course talking about the need for Australia as a nation to have a clear plan to seize the opportunities presented to us from the Asian century. The white paper states that one of Australia's greatest strengths is that we are a country which welcomes diversity and values respect, understanding and inclusion, which helps connect our people, business, institutions and governments. Cultural diversity is at the centre of Australia's identity. We are one of the most successful, if not the most successful, multicultural nations in the world. The paper goes on to say that there are gaps in participation in some of Australiaâs institutions:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our parliamentary representatives do not reflect fully our diverse population. In business, while there is encouraging cultural diversity among accounting and business services firms, there is a shortfall in the proportion of senior executives and up-and-coming executives who originate from non-English-speaking countries and who speak languages other than English.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The paper goes on:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Not just business, but high-performing organisations of all kinds, will need staff who can operate comfortably in the region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should ensure, as much as we can, that such gaps do not exist in Defence. The Defence Agency Multicultural Plan 2013-2015 states that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Defenceâs professionalism and war fighting strength is underpinned by our ability to problem solve, innovate and adapt quickly. We achieve outcomes by drawing on the different strengths, attributes and characteristics of the many individuals who make up our teams. We understand that teamwork requires we think about how we relate to one another, respect one another, recognise the value of each personâs contribution, are fair and inclusive, and that we work collaboratively to achieve the best results on all days and in all ways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is important that Defence engages a culturally diverse workforce that not only represents the community in which its personnel live and serve, but that draws from the full breadth of skills available. People are, and always will be, a fundamental part of our capability and valuing the differing skills and attributes of all personnel is essential to providing an inclusive workplace. Engaging with the Culturally and Linguistically Diverse community will not only support Defenceâs future capability through recruitment but will assist the Culturally and Linguistically Diverse community to embrace Defence as a positive and integral part of Australian life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The assistant minister has quoted Lieutenant Colonel Philip Holgin's 2013 article 'Religious diversity and the Australian Army: the next diversity frontier?'. I would also like to mention the fact that Lieutenant Colonel Holgin highlights a range of capability benefits to having a more culturally and linguistically diverse ADFâfor example, the improved cultural understanding of local populations in likely areas of future operations, including religious sensitivities. The assistant minister highlighted the benefits of having women on the ground in Uruzgan province as well as throughout Afghanistan. The intelligence and the feedback which they have managed to gain from that experience was invaluable to that mission. A more diverse ADF will enhance international understanding during coalition operations, multinational exercises, and other activities where diverse religions are represented in an international task force. It will also enhance the effectiveness of domestic disaster relief programs through consideration and understanding of religious customs, traditions and immediate faith-related needs in affected areas. It will further strengthen the high regard in which our defence forces are held, both in Australia and internationally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that the assistant minister has highlighted a number of new initiatives in his speech. I welcome his focus on recruitment. I welcome the government's immediate push to increase the accessible talent pool from which the ADF can recruit individuals with culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. This must be done by appealing to the influencersâthat is, parents, community leaders or teachers of different cultural and linguistic backgrounds. I also welcome the focus on the Australian Defence Force Cadets, and I would like to acknowledge the key role that cadets play in widening the recruitment pool for the ADF, as well as being a youth development organisation, which the cadets' primary role. Traditionally, cadets have more strongly reflected the multiculturalism of the Australian population. This needs to be nurtured and carried through into the ADF. Labor has a proud track record when it comes to cadets, and it is pleasing to see cadet numbers have steadily increased over the past six years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also welcome the assistant minister's steps to identify a part-time Islamic imam to join the ADF's religious advisory committee and to represent the 96 ADF members of Islamic faith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Significant progress is going to take time. And it is not going to be easyâI think the assistant minister is one of the first to acknowledge that, along with the service chiefs. I believe that a key factor in the encouraging results we are seeing with regard to having more women and more Indigenous Australians in our defence forces has been the commitment by the ADF leadership to this task. It has been particularly pleasing to see the dedication of the Chief of Army, David Morrison, to improving the gender balance within Army. Lieutenant General Morrison set clear KPIs for the army to attract more women, and the gender balance is improving. Leadership, both at the political level and in the ADF, is crucial, and that is why I welcome the commitment by the Assistant Minister for Defence to this issue. We have seen strong leadership from service chiefs; of the kind we saw, for example, from General Hurley and General Morrison on the issues of sexism and abuse. On becoming Chief of the Defence Force last year, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said that now is: 'a time of transformation for the ADF, and it is a time for continued reform for the ADF.' Diversity must continue to be at the centre of this reform. As a result of becoming a more inclusive force, the ADF will only become better; it will only become stronger; it will only lead to greater capabilityâbecause a more inclusive Defence Force will lead to a more harmonious and stronger Australia, and that is good for everyone.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  Earlier in the debate on this bill, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Amendment (Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee Abolition) Bill 2014, I was reflecting on the great work that CAMAC has done, particularly in trying to work out a framework for the introduction of crowdsourced equity funding in Australia, and what that might do to help support businesses, particularly start-ups and those that are at the early stage of innovation, being able to get access to much-needed capital. As I indicated earlier, CAMAC brought down a very comprehensive report in May. I would like to congratulate the subcommittee of CAMAC who brought that report down, led by chair, Greg Vickery AO, from Norton Rose Australia; along with Teresa Handicott from Corrs Chambers Westgarth; Professor Ian Ramsay, who is a professor of commercial law at the University of Melbourne; and Brian Salter, who is the General Counsel at AMP; and they were assisted by ASIC's Maan Beydoun. Even in mentioning those names, you get a sense of the calibre of people who have committed to assist in CAMAC's work. As I indicated in my earlier contribution, from a policy perspective it is simply a tragedy that with the abolition of CAMAC we will lose those skills and that expertise, and the acquisition of the insights of that bodyâand it is assumed that, once CAMAC is demolished in the way that is proposed, the three people currently working for CAMAC will be absorbed by Treasury. It is an absolute tragedy that the government will have to pay more to get that expertise, as opposed to what they had at hand and the great work CAMAC has done, such as this report. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report on crowdsource equity funding was widely welcomed by many for its breadth. It looked at jurisdictionsâparticularly in the US, the UK, New Zealand, Canada and within the EUâthat are working very hard to put, or have put, in place mechanisms to allow crowdsource equity funding. Not everyone would necessarily agree with what CAMAC put forward, but CAMAC was quite good in saying, 'This is where we believe the work has been scoped out of what should be done on crowdsource equity funding.' It said it was up to government then to advance things if it wanted to make alterations and recommendations on where to next. Certainly from the opposition's perspective we have done just that: we released a position paper in December that outlined a number of principles that should be adhered to or taken into account when putting together a framework for crowdsource equity funding These principles include: that we build recognition and support by government, business and the broader community that crowdsource equity funding is a desirable means of raising capital to drive innovation; that we should have investor and consumer safeguards in place and acknowledge that there is a great potential for investment return, balanced with a greater degree of risk; that freeing up the access of start-ups to crowdsource funding by loosening some of the regulatory measures proposed, including the requirement of the exempted public company status. We put that forward for discussion. Another couple of our principles are that legislation be developed to support the introduction of this mechanism is given a high priorityâwe have expressed our concern that it has been delayed; and that a light regulatory touch be put in place. We hope that the government gets on with the crowdsource equity funding legislation. We also believe it is wrong to get rid of CAMAC.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:46</span>):  I welcome this opportunity to speak this afternoon on the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Amendment (Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee Abolition) Bill 2014. As previous speakers have said and as the name suggests, the purpose of the amendment is to discontinue the operations of CAMAC, along with its legal committee, which was initially set up in 1991. The bill proposes that the operations and functions of CAMAC cease within 28 days of royal assent. Through this bill, the government is in a small but important way fulfilling two key commitments that we made prior to the election. The first was getting the budget back in order and paying back Labor's monstrous debt; the second was seeking to provide a more streamlined, lean and efficient government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have some sympathy for aspects of the complaints of members opposite, but from their chorus of complaints one is that this is a saving of only $2.8 million to the budget and is therefore completely unnecessary. It was ultimately that kind of thinking that put us on a trajectory of $667 billion of debtâthat each million dollars did not matter. We have taken the view in reviewing the operations of government that, to be lean and to operate as small a government as we possibly can, we must look everywhere for savings. CAMAC is part of that and so the $2.8 million of savings over the forward estimates with the abolition of CAMAC is important. The two aims of getting the budget back under control and striving for ever leaner government are interconnected aims. We on this side of the House know that in order to repair the budget a lot of work has to be done and no amount of obfuscation by members opposite will make it go awayâand it cannot be wished away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite opportunistic for those opposite to wish it all away and pretend there is no problem. But there is a problem. It is salient to remember the key facts. If we had completely unrestrained ability to generate revenue, then government's decisions might be different, but at the moment we are borrowing over $1 billion each and every month just to pay back the debt left by Labor. That is $1 billion each month rising to $3 billion, if debt is not restrained in the future. The scary thing is that we are paying at $1 billion of interest a month now with record low interest rates and record low debt rates for government accessing debt. If, as I suspect, interest rates rise in the not too distant future, it is scary to think what the debt and interest burdens Australian taxpayers will have to bear. Every dollar of interest that we pay to a foreign lender is a dollar less that goes to a school or a hospital. I would caution members opposite from scoffing at the savings come out of this billâthe $2.8 million of savings over the forward estimates. Sure, it is not sheep stations, but we have to look at every area of government and we have to make tough decisions between competing objectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some economists have forecastâI read in the paper on the weekendâthat within a few decades' time government debt in Australia will be 50 per cent of the economy and could rise to over 100 per cent of our annual GDP. Again, the thinking of members opposite is that we can ignore these problems and not tackle them with quite sensible and small measures like the abolition of CAMAC, but I would caution them against that. The bill before us today fulfils a commitment made as part of the budget process. I have alluded to that $2.8 million of savings over the forward estimates and, while this figure is a small stand-alone figure, ceasing the operations of small bodies and committees such as CAMAC generate savings beyond the annual appropriation. As we all see from our committee work and all of the oversight that goes into bodies such as this, the ongoing operation of small agencies like CAMAC absorbs resources across the wider Commonwealth public service, and the oversight and administrative costs are obviously on top of the direct appropriation of $2.8 million. So the savings are somewhat larger than that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But when these cost savings are multiplied across the federal government in its entirety, we are talking about a big number. One of the scary things that we realised when we came into government was that we asked the bureaucrats, 'Please give us a list of every committee and every body that the federal government funds or administers in some way.' We could not get that list. We could not get a definitive list of every single committee or body that is funded by the Commonwealth government. If that does not tell you that we need to put a ruler over bodies such as CAMAC, then I do not know what does. Again, I think this is a very sensible change. The decision to abolish CAMAC, along with a number of other government bodies in that big list that no-one could actually give us, also fulfils the second commitment that I alluded to earlier: to deliver a leaner, more efficient government sector. The abolition of government bodies like CAMAC will improve coordination and accountability, reduce the costs associated with separate governance arrangements, and increase inefficiency in how public funds are utilised. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is always going to be pretty tough to walk into this chamber and try and convince the Australian Labor Party that we should have a smaller, leaner government. Because ingrained in their DNA is bigger bureaucracies, bigger governments, that government funding of any body is preferable to allowing private enterprise or private experts to provide the type of service that CAMAC has provided. I think that in the comments of members opposite today that ingrained ideology has come through, in saying that government will not be able to source the kind of advice provided by CAMAC in any other way. That also impugns every private sector individual involved with CAMAC. For people involved in business, professional bodiesâlegal, accountingâthey will continue to provide independent advice to government. If we cannot consult with the private sector, presumably those opposite are arguing that we should set up bodies in every conceivable field of public policy and get advice from them, because there is no point in consulting with private enterprise, industry bodies, the Law Council or any of the other professional bodies. That does not meet any test of scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As members of our government are aware, we are proud of the fact that we have removed thousands of pages of regulation and slashed more than $2 billion in business regulatory compliance costs. I know those opposite are sick of hearing that, but that is something that we are very proud of, as being a huge achievement in the first year of government. It ultimately allows business to spend less time and money dealing with regulation and more on creating new jobs. So our smaller and more rational government reforms, of which this bill is a part, form a key component of our important deregulatory agenda. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As former speakers have said, CAMAC was established for reforming and renaming previously existing bodies with the purpose of providing advice to the government on matters relating to the reform of corporations and other financial and securities related legislation. This was part of an effort to bring about a national framework for corporations and securities regulations in the 1980s. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">CAMAC and its predecessors provided the Commonwealth with an independent group of corporate experts who could provide advice on the progress of the implementation of the newly unified laws in this area. The body also sought to provide an avenue for the industry to voice its views and concerns on any proposed changes or reforms seen as desirable in the area of corporations and financial law. So for the reasons I have outlined earlier, we do not believe the case is justifiable to have a taxpayer funded committee of this nature, due to the availability of other more important bodies who already provide a role in performing this function.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we recognise the important contribution that CAMAC has had over the years to law reform in these areas, this bill recognises that the business and economic environment has changed since the agency was first established in 1991. As I have said earlier to members opposite, we are fully confident in the professionalism and capability of business and industry groups to make their case to government without the need for additional bureaucracy. The abolition of CAMAC will not prevent or hinder the ability of business, the business community, experts, those people who are engaged in professional bodies, whether they be lawyers, accountants, bankers or others, to advise government in good faith what they believe is in the best interests of that policy area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the passage of this bill, the government will also continue to seek independent, high-quality advice when necessary, ensuring that advice provided is practical and evidence based through utilising specialist, relevant expertise, such as has already happened, whether that be through panels or other appointees and industry experts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After the abolition of this body, the Treasury's Markets Group, as other members have also highlighted earlier, will continue to advise the government on matters of corporate law, financial markets and financial services. This advice will continue to be informed by regular engagement with the broader industry and relevant experts in the field. Further, ASIC will retain the ability to provide advice to the government of the day, whoever that may be, on matters associated with amendment or law reform in these areas. It already happens. None of ASIC's functions will be altered as a result of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the government will also be able to refer matters to the Productivity Commission as well as the Australian Law Reform Commission to assist in any work that is required. Both of these bodies have previously completed reviews on matters such as the regulatory burden on business, insolvency law and, relatively recently, managed investment schemes. So I and the government believe that, when all of that is taken into account, this is a sensible bill given the changing economic circumstances and that it fulfils, as I said, two of the government's key aimsâand that is leaner, more efficient government with less red tape and also providing reasonable savings to the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of CAMAC, the evidence is apparent to me that there are numerous other government agencies that will be more than capable of performing the tasks that CAMAC now performs and, therefore, I see this as an absolutely sensible bill which fulfils a commitment we made at the time of the budget. I therefore commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  This is a classic example of this government getting rid of what is a very efficient and effective body in a move that will end up costing Australian taxpayers much more money. The Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee advises ASIC and costs $1 million a year. It has three staff and costs $1 million a year. That is it. Yet, the Abbott government is abolishing it and the result will be that the work that was performed by CAMAC for $1 million a year will now be contracted out to private organisations to undertake. There is no doubt at all that those organisations will charge much more than $1 million for the reports that they prepare for the government over many years to come in respect of corporations and market advice. So here we have another example of the great rhetoric of the Abbott government, saying that they are reducing regulation and saving taxpayers' money, when in actual fact this bill will cost Australian taxpayers much more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 1984 the Commonwealth has had an independent research based reform body focused on corporations and financial markets. Since its inception, CAMAC has delivered sound, balanced, well-researched and market oriented law reform proposals. It has been widely acknowledged that CAMAC's role and advice has provided invaluable guidance to multiple governments on subjects from managed investment schemes to shareholder claims against insolvent companies and corporate voluntary administration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For its work CAMAC has received high praise from key interest groups and commentators such as the editor of the Australian Journal of Corporate Law, Professor Neil Andrews, who described CAMAC's expertise as:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ unmatched in the technical details of corporate and securities law and in sustaining the manners gentle style of Australian business regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="page-break-after:avoid;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Governance Institute of Australia, too, had very positive things to say about CAMAC. They said it is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ a lean, efficient and highly-regarded organisation that has improved our corporate institutions over the past two decades and continues to have a vital role to play in the decades ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But recognition of the good work CAMAC has done over the years has not just emanated from key stakeholders and commentators; the Abbott government, too, has expressed its appreciation for the committee. In its industry innovation and competitiveness agenda document of last October, the government praised CAMAC's study of crowd sourced equity funding, describing the committee as 'a government advisory body with strong financial market experience'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, as has become clear on many topics, this government thinks it knows better than the experts and has decided to press on with scrapping this eminent committee which, as Judith Fox from the Governance Institute of Australia says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ punches well above its weight and delivers economic benefits that greatly outweigh its funding costs â¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'Economic benefits that greatly outweigh funding costs' is the best way to describe CAMAC in one sentence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at that for a moment. CAMAC is supported by three staff and costs $1 million a year. That is itâ$1 million. But this government wants to close the book on the committee that has advised on almost every chapter in modern Australian corporate history, a decision that simply beggars belief from a supposedly pro-business government. This disastrous bill is proof the government has firmly planted its fingers in its ears as it pursues its bloody-minded ideological agenda. The shadow Treasurer hit the nail on the head when he said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I can only assume the government, in its ideological drive to abolish organisations, just didn't look at what CAMAC does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would not surprise me if the minister who introduced this bill has no idea about the work of CAMAC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The irony of this bill has not gone unnoticed. Speaking to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> in June 2014, a longstanding member of CAMAC, Professor Ian Ramsay of the University of Melbourne law school, agreed that the government's decision to abolish the committee ran counter to its supposed commitment to business in Australia. He said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It cuts directly against the government's own philosophy and position about facilitating business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great strengths of CAMAC is its independence. Members are appointed on the basis of their knowledge and experience in business, finance and law not on favour with the particular government of the day. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, CAMAC's absorption into Treasury, a government department that is charged with implementing government policy, threatens that independence. This outcome has been of concern to many stakeholders. In June 2014 the chief executive of the Governance Institute of Australia, Tim Sheehy, lamented the loss of this independence, citing research into the struggling annual general meeting which had been removed from CAMAC and handed to Treasuryâresearch that still remains outstanding. This removal of independence, however, is hardly surprising given the government's aversion to independent advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You only need look at what happened in estimates last week and the approach that this government has taken in reaction to the Australian Human Rights Commission's recent report into children in detention to see that this government does not like independent, expert advice. They do not like independent, expert advice that is critical of its policies. What is their approach? In this case, on markets advisory and corporations, it is to shut the body down, even though it only costs $1 million a year. That function will be absorbed into Treasury. What is the approach that Treasury will take when it comes to getting expert, independent advice on matters to deal with law reform in this area? They will contract it out to the private sector at a cost of millions of dollars. We have all seen these reports before. They come up in estimates when governments ask private organisations to undertake research and independent reports on their behalf, and the costs of those are sometimes astronomical. They are well into the multiple millions of dollars. Yet, they are going to get rid of a body that only costs $1 million to administer, with three staff; a body that is generally lauded throughout the community, and provides expert advice on markets and corporations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Duplication is another excuse that the government has given for the abolition of the committee, and again doubt has been cast as to what duplication, if any, this bill will resolve. In fact, a number of submissions to Treasury questioned this justification. In its submission, the Australian Institute of Company Directors expressed its misgivings, stating:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ we are of the view that dismantling CAMAC is contrary to the Government's own objectives as set out in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Smaller and</span><span style="font-style:italic;">More Rational Government</span> reforms â¦ CAMAC epitomizes the high quality, effective and cost conscious approach the Government is trying to achieve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor opposes this bill for the simple fact that there is no efficiency gain. The abolition of a highly regarded committee will have a detrimental impact on the quality of advice being received by this government and, ultimately, the quality of law reform that is undertaken in the corporations and financial services space by this government, and by governments of the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has been made abundantly clear by this government, lurching from policy failure to captain's picks to captain's call, is that it can ill-afford to dispense with high-quality independent advice for a very, very efficient and cost effective means. That is what CAMAC has providedâa million dollars to operate on an annual basis, but the value to government in terms of its independent advice, on law reform concerning corporations and financial markets has been exponentially greater than the million dollar cost for which it is run. Once again, this is an example of this government cutting off its nose to spite its face. This will cost Australian taxpayers more. It will ensure that private organisations get contracts that will cost Australian taxpayers multiple millions of dollars, all because of this government's misguided approach to reducing regulation and, apparently, being pro-business.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="248006" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BUTLER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  I rise to oppose the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Amendment (Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee Abolition) Bill 2014. Labor opposes the abolition of the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee for some very important reasons. Why would a government that purports to be pro-business abolish CAMAC? That is the question that must be on everyone's mind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">CAMAC has long enjoyed bipartisan support, and has provided support and advice to governments of both political persuasions. There has been an independent-based reform body for corporations and financial markets since 1978, starting with the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee, and followed by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, in 1989, which became CAMAC, in 2002. The event that precipitated CAMAC coming into existence you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, was the High Court decision in Re Wakim, which caused a rethink of all of the cooperative corporations law regulation and the way in which the Commonwealth would have the power to ensure that there was cooperative and consistent corporations legislation across the nation. The states, of course, referred their corporations powers to the Commonwealth to allow for that to occur on the heels of that decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Law Council of Australia's Business Law Section points out, part of the national compact, and part of the deal under which the states agree to refer their corporations law regulation powers to the Commonwealth is that the states, among other things, get to have input into the selection of members for CAMAC. The states recognise that, in referring those powersâand it is a significant decision to refer, of courseâthe need for ongoing, constructive, independent, disinterested, expert advice to the Commonwealth on ongoing corporations law reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, corporations form part of the economic fabric of our society. The way that corporations and markets run affects every household in Australia. It is a fact that if corporations and markets are run in a way that is poor or inappropriate, then that has real consequences for the people around the kitchen tables in Australian households. It has real consequences for families and individuals. So, there has long been a strongly held view that we need to have ongoing review and reform of corporations law in this country. We have seen the consequences of that through the work that has been done by CAMAC, amongst other organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">CAMAC has produced dozens of reports. There are some that would be very familiar to members in this place: reports in respect of continuous disclosure obligations, an issue with which I am obviously very interested, because of the consumer and shareholder protection aspects of continuous disclosure; company restructuring to avoid liquidation; executive remuneration and directors' liability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In asking ourselves why a government that likes to hold itself out as being pro business would want to abolish CAMAC, we have to remember that CAMAC is such a highly regarded organisation because it has such integration in the business and professional community. Practitioners are involved in CAMAC. Appointments are made by the minister, following consultation with the states and territories, and made on the basis of people's knowledge of or experience in business, the administration of companies, the financial markets, financial products and financial services, law, economics or accounting. The chairperson of ASIC is also a member of CAMAC. So it is clear that the persons involved in CAMAC are very well placed to provideâfrom a practitioner perspective, from an expert perspective and from a disinterested, independent perspectiveâstrong and rigorous advice to governments about corporations regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So to me it seems odd that, even this government, as unpredictable and irrational as it can sometimes be, would move to abolish CAMAC. But, if you look at the Law Council of Australia's Business Law Section submission, which repeats a number of the arguments made to that organisation by Senator Cormann, two of those arguments are particularly revealingâfirstly, that the government can source independent advice from Treasury and regulators; and, secondly, that business does not need a taxpayer funded body through which to express itself, that business is able to express its own views without that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those two things are revealing for a couple of reasons. Advice from Treasury and regulators is deeply important, but it is different from and complementary to the type of advice that can be provided by practitioners and experts who have been engaged in corporations and markets throughout their professional lives. They are different sources of advice, and one does not replace the other. More concerning is the idea that somehow CAMAC is just there to push a business barrow. CAMAC is a disinterested committee that acts in the national interest. Businessesâand this point is made by the Law Council of Australia in its submissionâare perfectly able to make their own arguments from a lobbying perspective, from an advocacy perspective, to promote their commercial interests. But CAMAC serves a different role; it serves the national interest and the public interest in appropriate and ongoing reform of the law in so far as it relates to corporations and markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are some of the points made by submittersâand it is very difficult to find submitters who are in favour of abolishing CAMAC. The Australian Institute of Company Directors, an organisation of which I am a former member, expressed dismay in their 24 October submission. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Institute of Company Directors â¦is dismayed that the Federal Government has expressed an intention to continue with the abolition of â¦ CAMAC â¦ </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And why wouldn't they be? The submission went on:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Company Directors <span style="font-style:italic;">strongly opposes</span> the abolition of CAMAC and we recommend that the proposed abolition not proceed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They say that, though the government is seeking 'to remove inefï¬cient and complex structures':</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">CAMAC epitomizes the high quality, effective and cost conscious approach the Government is trying to achieve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, in abolishing CAMAC, the government is achieving the very opposite of its stated aims. AICD say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the Government tries to reduce red tape, we are of the view that the Government's decision to dismantle CAMAC is likely to increase red tape in the long term. This is because there will no longer be a cost effective, highly experienced and independent body considering improvements to the corporate law in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Therein lies part of the problem with this bill, because, although it has been couched in terms of red-tape reduction and savings, it will have the opposite effect on both counts. It is a point that ought not be lost on members opposite. As the Australian Restructuring Insolvency &amp; Turnaround Association said in their submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For an operating cost of less than $1 million per annum since 1998, CAMAC has delivered sophisticated and important advice and reports to policy makers and industry. Indeed, CAMAC's work continues to be instructive for much of the work we do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, any organisation and its members that deal with insolvency with a view to keeping businesses in operation and getting businesses out of financial trouble so that they can continue to contribute to the economy and provide employment is going to have something to say about the decision to abolish an expert body of the nature of CAMAC. As ARITA pointed out, there have been a number of valuable reports by CAMAC, such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Managed investment schemes</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Guidance for directors</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Members' schemes of arrangement</span> and others that have gone directly to that issue of companies that are in trouble. They went on to say of CAMAC:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ it was the epitome of efficient government, with deep connections into industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ we think it is counter-intuitive for Government to pursue the abolition of CAMAC in the name of more efficient government. CAMAC has delivered real value to the efficient and robust operation of corporations, financial markets and the economy as a whole and we urge the Government to reconsider its position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the House has heard, the Chief Executive of the Governance Institute of Australia was also very critical of the decision to abolish CAMAC. One of the great strengths that he pointed out in their submission is CAMAC's ability to engage with stakeholders, fulfilling an important role. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">CAMAC is respected by all stakeholders for the quality of its in-depth research and stakeholder consultation. Stakeholders also view the independence of CAMAC as a great strength. Governance Institute is of the view that such independence cannot be transferred to a government agency charged with implementing government policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He lists as three examples of the value of CAMAC the recommendations on related party financial transactions in respect of conflicts of interest; the introduction of a statutory derivative action that removed obstacles to shareholders in bringing litigation, which is important in ensuring that shareholders maintain appropriate levels of power within companies and can hold directors and companies to account; and enhancements to the requirement that directors and senior executives of a listed entity disclose any trading by them in the securities of that listed entity, meaning that trading by directors did not undermine market fairness and efficiency. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All of these reforms have greatly strengthened corporate governance in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just those three examples underscore the value of CAMAC and really serve to reinforce the short-sightedness of the decision to abolish it. The suggestion that saving under $1 million a year is what is of paramount importance here is the government making the usual mistake that it makes of confusing saving in the short term with value in the long term. The question is not just, 'What is the cost?' but, 'What is the benefit?' What is the benefit? What is the return on the investment? That is the real question, not, 'What is the saving in the short term?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many submissions from serious and respected organisations expressing dismay at the government's decision to abolish CAMAC. If those submissions are acceptedâand why shouldn't they be?âthe government is likely to find that this so-called reform will cost more money than it saves and will lead to more problems and more red tape, as the AICD pointed out.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned the submission from the Law Council of Australia, which strongly objected to winding up CAMAC, as the government knows. The submission said that the Law Council of Australia wished to draw the attention of the minister:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ to the importance of maintaining confidence in the national system of corporate and securities market regulation, underpinned by referral of powers by the States to the Commonwealth, in which CAMAC plays a vital role;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That consideration ought to be taken into account as a very serious consideration, because a serious concern along with the integrity of the regulation of corporations in this country is whether people have confidence that corporations are operating appropriately and that the law is keeping up with changes in the market. The Law Council made the point:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ the Government would have no significant grounds for doubting the excellent contribution that CAMAC has made to the cause of sound corporate and market law reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is no doubt a result of the combination of the quality of the full-time lawyers engaged by CAMAC, and the practical and expert business and legal input systematically achieved both through CAMAC's committee structure and the submissions received through the consultation process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the importance of the practical expertise is highlighted. They give the example of the crowdsourcing reference. We heard the member for Chifley speak today about this issue. It is something about which he has intimate acknowledge. He drew on CAMAC's work in preparing his excellent discussion paper in respect of crowdsourcing. The fact is that this is an issue that needs to be continually discussed: how do you leverage the new opportunities for corporations? As the Law Council said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">CAMAC was able to produce an internationally applauded report through a combination of thorough research and practical inputsâ</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">into this new phenomenon. That is one of many examples of the importance and value of CAMAC. The Law Council also talked about the recent report in respect of industry innovation and competitiveness in serving to underscore the value and the importance of CAMAC and noted that the government had in that report acknowledged the importance of CAMAC, notwithstanding that, many months before, the government had announced its decision to abolish it. Doesn't that just demonstrate how odd this decision has been.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the concerns of the Law Council that I would echo is that if you abolish CAMAC you abolish an organisation that operates transparently. Perhaps that is part of the reason why this government dislikes CAMAC, because it is transparent, because it is disinterested, because it does look at the national and public interest. But this sort of ideological urge to get rid of everything that the government does not understand ought to be resisted when it comes to this organisation. It is an organisation that runs at under $1 million per annum yet provides such value to policymakers and industry in the ongoing need to ensure that our corporations laws are appropriate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="LKU" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'DWYER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  I thank those members who have contributed to this debate. This has been a very good discussion about the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee. I would particularly like to place on record my admiration for the work that CAMAC has done in years past, but that is not to say that an organisation that has been set up should be set up in perpetuity. This bill, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Amendment (Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee Abolition) Bill 2014, will cease the operation of the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, or CAMAC as it is known, and its legal committee and bring the legal identity of the agency to a close. Importantly, this bill ensures that, despite the cessation of CAMAC, the rights of third parties who have interacted with the agency prior to its abolition are not negatively impacted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government recognises the contribution that CAMAC has made to the development of corporate and financial services law reform, the business environment has changed greatly since 1989, when the agency was first established. The professionalism and capacity of industry representative groups is now much stronger. Further, business is increasingly active in putting its views on the operation of the corporations laws to government without the need for an additional layer of taxpayer funded bureaucracy. In addition, Treasury and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission will continue to provide advice to the government about matters relating to corporate law, financial markets and financial services. Such advice will continue to be informed by regular engagement with relevant experts and industry. The government also retains the ability to commission specific reports and inquiries utilising market specialists on an ad hoc basis or to refer matters to other bodies, such as the Productivity Commission and the Australian Law Reform Commission for advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill fulfils the government's 2014-15 budget commitment to abolish CAMAC as part of its smaller governments agenda, delivering a smaller and more rational government footprint. This agenda is designed to cut waste and duplication while improving the efficiency and focus of the Commonwealth Public Service. As noted by the National Commission of Audit last year, there are too many government bodies in Australia. This leads to duplication and overlap, unnecessary complexity, a lack of accountability, the potential for uncoordinated advice and avoidable costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having established a central list of all government bodies, it was staggering to see that the government inherited a total of 1,252 separate government bodies from the previous Labor government. That is far too many, and it is appropriate that the government review these bodies and, where necessary, take action. The government has acted to do something about this, reducing the number of government bodies by 251 since the election. Some of these actions have large, monetary values. For example, the government completed the sale of Medibank Private, raising $5.7 billion in proceeds that will be recycled into productivity enhancing and job creating infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also merged AusAID into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, saving close to $400 million over four years. Others, like the abolition of CAMAC, have left significant savings. For example, we have ceased the Abalone Aquaculture Health Accreditation Workshop and the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation, while the role of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Selection Committee will be subsumed into the Department of Agriculture. However, when the savings from all smaller government reforms are combined, so far it is expected to total $539.5 million, making a significant contribution to much-needed budget repair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The smaller government agenda will continue with a fourth tranche of reforms to be announced in the 2015-16 budget, including decisions after the consideration of scoping studies initiated in the 2014-15 budget. With this bill, the government is fulfilling its commitment to abolish CAMAC and its legal committee as part of the second phase of our smaller government reform agenda. It is an agenda that makes a significant contribution to repairing Australia's budget. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

It is the growing impact of methamphetamines, particularly ice, on the community of Gippslandâthe enormous social and economic harm that it is causing our community. It has been the subject of a great deal of public debate and discussion in more recent times, and also the subject of community forums, one of which will be held tonight in Sale, in the heart of my electorate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To begin with I want to refer to some comments from Mr Clive Allsop, the Regional Coordinating Magistrate at Latrobe Valley Magistrates' Court, whom I had the pleasure of meeting recently. Mr Allsop gave evidence last year to a Victorian parliamentary inquiry into the supply and use of amphetamines in Victoria. The evidence he gave is quite staggering. He made an extensive submission to the inquiry, but I will just pick out some of the main points. He said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    color:#000000;&#xD;&#xA;  text-decoration:none underline;" />I have been in the legal system coming up for 50 years in another three years and this is the worst crisis I have seen in all that time. â¦ There are places, particularly in East Gippsland, where ice is being sold at half the cost of cannabis, which of course makes it directly attractive to young children. In one particular area there are kids of 12 who are starting to use ice because it is easier to get than ganja. â¦ I have never seen anything like the impact of this stuff that I am seeing now. â¦ The problem exists through the whole of Gippsland. Drouin, Warragul, Morwell and Sale are referred to as being knee-deep in ice; to a serious but lesser degree, Moe, Bairnsdale, South Gippsland and Orbost. â¦ Family<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    color:#000000;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;    font-size:10.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  "> disintegration and family domestic violence is in epidemic proportions as a consequence of ice</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    color:#000000;&#xD;&#xA;  text-decoration:none underline;">.</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is a direct and palpable link between ice and domestic violence. â¦ The worst part of that story is that there are occasions when victims of domestic violenceâand I have yet to do a case where a bloke has been a victim of domestic violenceâare forced into prostitution to provide the funds for their 'partner's' habit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is damning evidence from Magistrate Allsop to a Victorian parliamentary inquiry. The tragedy of the evidence he provided is that in a region like Gippsland, which already has a significant problem with family and domestic violence, to have a magistrate of Mr Allsop's seniority indicating a further serious spike in domestic violence and suggesting that the partners of ice users are being forced into prostitution to provide funds for their partner's habit is remarkably disturbing and of great concern to me as the local member and more broadly to the whole community and to regional committees throughout Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is happening today not just in Gippsland but, I would suggest, right across regional Australia. I do not have enough experience in suburban areas to have much to offer in terms of that debate. Our families are being torn apart by this drug. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise. When Mr Allsop was asked about the comparison to alcoholâwhich is another serious problem in many regional communities, including Gippsland, and particularly in the Indigenous community in Gippslandâhe told the inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is also a serious problem, but the impact of ice is greater than the impact of anything I have seen in all my years in the legal profession. I have been a magistrate now for nearly 19 years and I have never seen anything like it. I have been through the cannabis days, the heroin days, the upper echelons of the stuff they stick up their noses and all that sort of stuff. Nothing has had the sudden impact on the community at large that ice has had.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have raised my concerns directly with the Prime Minister and Minister Nash, who is directly involved in combating this issue at a federal level, and I know they understand the pain and suffering this drug is causing in our communities. I commend the government, and I recognise that the previous government did take some steps in this direction as well. The new coalition government has decided to make ice the focus of the work being undertaken by our national drugs advisory body. The Australian National Advisory Council on Alcohol and Drugs has been instructed by the government to provide advice on ice and methamphetamines as its first priorityâand I believe that is a good decision by the government. I understand that the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments are working together to revise the National Drug Strategy and make ice the priority target that it needs to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe this issue needs national attention, state attention and local attention. Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish I could tell you I had all the answers. We espouse our great wisdom at the dispatch box but unfortunately on this occasion I cannot think what the actual answer is going to be. As I stand here today, I can tell you in vivid detail about the impact this drug is having on families close to me and close to people in my office. I can tell you stories of three personal friends whose lives have been impacted and torn apart by this drug in just the past 12 months. But I will respect the confidence of those families and not name names in this place. Do not believe anyone who tells you that this drug is only having an impact on people from low-socioeconomic backgrounds, people from the wrong side of the tracks, seasoned criminals or whatever it might be. This drug is tearing apart everyday families today. These are people who have jobs and who volunteer in my community. These are people whose own children have jobs, and they would never have thought that their child would get caught up in this menace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been provided with figures to highlight the increase in methamphetamine use in Victoriaâand I sincerely was not aware that the problem had got so bad so quickly. Between 2011 and 2014 there has been a virtual tripling of offences for trafficking, possessing and using methamphetamines in Victoriaâand that is all ice. Possession cases have more than tripled and trafficking cases have almost tripled. Unfortunately, the 2014-15 figures indicate that the trend is continuing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I do not know what the answers are. I think part of it is undoubtedly about raising awareness, as I am trying to do here this afternoon, and explaining to young people the risks that are associated with a drug such as this and illicit drug use more generally. Of course, we need enforcement. The criminals who mastermind these types of activities and condemn others to a life of misery need to be caught and prosecuted, and we need to support the police in those endeavours. But many of the traffickers in regional communities are victims of the drug themselves. They have been lured into a world of criminality and are forced to participate in order to feed their habit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We undoubtedly need more resources to provide rehabilitation services in regional areas. I understand that the waiting list in Victoria for publicly funded rehabilitation places is now out to more than 12 months. If you have private funds, you can circumvent that and buy your way into the system at a very significant costâand only a certain percentage of the community would be able to afford that cost. We definitely need more resources to provide for rehabilitation. Those services need to be made available to us, in regional areas, more. While I accept that the addicts themselves need to be taken out of the environment where they have incurred the addiction, I still think it is good value for regional families if their loved ones are closer to home while they undertake rehabilitation. Also, we need to support the programs that work. To this end, I have written to the government about a program in Bairnsdale which has been successful at diverting young offenders away from jail and helping them to get back on their feet. I hope the government is in a position to support that program into the future. It is about prevention. Undoubtedly, it is about early intervention. And it is about harm reduction and rehabilitation. But it is going to take time and, as I said, the effort of local, state and federal governments, and our communities more generally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to draw attention to one group in my community that I believe isâpotentially, at leastâheavily exposed to illicit drug use and deserving of additional attention into the future. I hasten to add in raising this point this afternoon that I have no direct evidence to support the comments that I am about to make, other than the anecdotal information I have received from people involved in country football clubs. I am someone who has had a lot of participation in country football and netball clubs over many years. I think they do an enormous amount of good in our community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned that there is a genuine riskâone that requires far more investigation by the relevant agencies and authoritiesâin the way young men, in particular, are exposed to illicit drugs through the country football clubs in Victoria. This is a high-risk group. It is undoubtedly a target market for those who wish to sell these products. You are talking about young, fit and active men. Most of them have jobs and some disposable income. They are perfect for the market that the criminals are seeking to capitalise on. Ice can spread like a cancer among young men who, almost by definition, have little appreciation of their own mortality. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The high-profile media coverage over the last couple of weeks in relation to the alleged drug use by elite footballers in both rugby league and Australian rules is, I think, a warning siren to our country football clubs in Victoria. If it is happening in the AFL and the NRL, why would anyone think it is not happening in bush football? I continue to be told stories of young footballers using drugs, but I simply do not know how widespread the problem is. As I said, it is anecdotal evidence that is put to me. It is whispered in the change rooms; it is talked about on the sidelines. People point out individual players and say, 'He's on the stuff; he's not'. We need to get to the bottom of this for the integrity of sport and also for the health of these young men.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to refer to some comments dating back to October 2013 by a Warrigal police officer, who was actually the Baw Baw police youth resource officer at the time, Kevin McClaren. He claimed then, almost 18 months, that ice use was rife in sporting clubs, particularly football clubs. The article says:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">He says he believes many players use ice as a performance enhancer because of its ability to keep the user awake and alert for days on end.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The article went on:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">He says drug testing n amateur football leagues should become the norm, as it is in the AFL.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I do not wish to be alarmist, but wherever I go in Gippsland I meet people who are concerned about the impact of ice and the extraordinary efforts that will be required to solve the problem. It will involve all of us in our local communitiesâfrom the teachers in our schools and the sporting coachesâright through to the Prime Minister's office itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Minister Nash, whom I have had conversations with on this issue, for the work, sincerity and effort she is putting into this problem. I congratulate the Prime Minister and his office for their work to date, as well. But I simply warn: there is so much more that we will have to do in the future. I commend members opposite who have also shared discussions with me on this issue. I will not go into naming names, but there are many members who have expressed concerns about the impact this drug is having both socially and economically in regional communities. I commend people like Magistrate Clive Alsop for the work he is doing in trying to prevent the use of ice and also to minimise the harm in the community. I commend members opposite to work with our state colleagues and their communitiesâin any way they canâto help young people in our nation escape the scourge of what is a very alarming situation. I thank the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:57</span>):  These three bills propose appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund in addition to those appropriated through the appropriations acts that were part of the 2014-15 budget. These bills reflect decisions that were made as part of the 2014-15 MYEFO and changes to machinery of government as part of the ministry reshuffle that took effect on 23 December 2014. In summary, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) seeks to appropriate just under $1.4 billion for the 2014-15 financial year. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) seeks approval to appropriate just under $241 million for the 2014-15 financial year. The Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) seeks approval for just under $114 million for the 2014-15 financial year. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The additional $1.7 billion in appropriations does not tell the full story. What we do not see are the cuts that were associated with MYEFO. In particular, I want to highlight the cuts that have occurred to Australia's overseas development aid budget. In addition to the $7.6 billion that was cut from foreign aid in the 2014-15 budget, the 2014-15 MYEFO revealed a further $3.7 billion would go on top of the $7.6 billion. This means that the Abbott Liberal government have slashed $11.2 billion from the Australian aid programâa cut at every budget and financial update since they were elected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's level of commitment to overseas development aid is now at 0.2 per cent of gross national income. Our level of development aid is now the lowest that it has ever been in our nation's history. What an embarrassment for a developed and wealthy nation such as Australia. They have now cut more money from aid than was budgeted for by Labor in our entire forward estimates. In the last budget, 20 per cent of all cutsâone dollar in every five that was cutâcame from the one area, and the biggest cut was to overseas development aid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about cuts to aid we are talking about billions of dollars. But the aid agencies like to think about what these cuts will mean not in terms of dollars but in terms of programs that could be run. Australia funds a number of very important programs that fuel development, particularly throughout our region in the Asia-Pacific. In terms of programsâmoney being delivered on the groundâwhat these aid cuts will mean is in these terms: 1.4 million children could be born without a birth attendant; 2.2 million children may not get to enrol in school; 3.7 million children may not be vaccinated; 4.7 million people may not get access to safe drinking water; and 22 million people in emergency situations may go unassisted. That is the dollar value of these cuts to the aid program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Plan International, a very well respected international aid organisation that provides programs on the ground, particularly for the advancement of women in developing nations, have recently calculated what the effect of the cuts to overseas development aid will mean for some of the programs that they run throughout the world. According to Plan International, the cuts to aid could mean 220,000 fewer girls will be enrolled in school, 400,000 fewer girls will be immunised, 3,153 fewer classrooms where girls could learn will be renovated or built, 157,000 fewer girls will get better access to safe drinking water, and 750,000 fewer textbooks will be made available to girls by Australia. That is a snapshot of some of the sorts of programs that Australia funds in regions such as the Pacific. In nations such as Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste, the Solomon Islands and places in Africa, that is what the cuts to overseas development aid mean on the ground.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the Prime Minister promising before the election there would be not cuts to the ABC or SBS, we have seen $250 million cut from these broadcasters in these MYEFO figures associated with these appropriation bills. Their revised higher education package of reforms has parents in my electorate and across Australia deeply worried that their children will not be able to afford a university education, while their GP co-payment is designed to put more pressure on the sick and the struggling. But, notwithstanding the pain being inflicted upon the Australian people through these massive cuts, the MYEFO statement revealed that, due to the government's own economic mismanagement, an additional $44 billion would be added to the projected budget deficit over the four years to 2017-18.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Abbott government, the unemployment rate has increased to 6.4 per cent, higher than any time under the former Labor government and the highest that it has been since 2002, when guess who was the Minister for Employment at the time? None other than our nation's Prime Minister, Tony Abbott. ABS figures reveal 100,000 more people have joined the unemployment queues since the last election. The number of unemployed people in Australia is now 795,200âthe highest in more than 20 years. Earlier, the Reserve Bank warned that stagnation in business confidence would continue to weigh on the economy and send unemployment to 6.5 percent and potentially even higher. Not only did the government slash and burn important and hugely beneficial programs, they also put the boot into a number of important revenue-raising programs, and this is why the government budget position has deteriorated. It has deteriorated between the May budget and MYEFO. If you look at the difference between the May budget and the MYEFO, the fall in revenue is almost exactly equal to the revenue that was raised by the price on carbon and the mining taxes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is close to $10 billion wiped out of government revenue and there is additional cost associated with the programs that were put in place to replace them. I speak, of course, of this government's approach to climate change and their so-called Direct Action policy. What the government has done is remove a market based mechanism. Remember, here we are talking about a Liberal government that believed in the sanctity of markets as the best way to produce the most efficient economic outcomes. They have got rid of that revenue that was being raised by the market based mechanismâthe $6.3 billionâand they are putting in its place a policy that is going to cost an additional $4 billion over the coming years. Get rid of revenue and put in place an additional program that is going to cost more moneyâso-called Direct Action. Where do Australians think that that extra $4 billion is going to come from? Is it going to fall out of the sky? Of course not. The Australian taxpayer is going to pay for that. The Australian taxpayer will pay, and this fallacy that the government propagates that they are reducing the burden on households, that they are easing cost-of-living pressure is just thatâa fallacyâbecause Australian taxpayers will pay for the additional cost of Direct Action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the government's approach: we will give a tax break to the biggest polluting companies in Australiaâmost notably the coal fired power generation companiesâand we will lose all of that revenue that we get from them to reduce emissions in our economy, but we will hit the Australian people up for it. We will hit the Australia taxpayer up for it. We will let off the big multinational corporations but hit up the Australian taxpayer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what has been the result of that? The result has been that emissions in our economy have gone up. Carbon emissions in Australia have increased since the Abbott government removed the price on carbon. And that is no surprise, because the economy-wide economic incentive to reduce emissions has now been removed, and the biggest polluters in our economy now have no economic incentive at all to reduce their emissions. So, guess what? They are not. Emissions in our economy are going up. Australian taxpayers are paying more for it. But the greatest shame about this policy approach it that really we are handing on the cost to our kids. We are saying to a future generation of Australians that we do not believe that we need to take the necessary action on climate change and we will ask you to do it in the future; we will pass the cost on to you. And every economist worth their salt, every climate change advisor worth their salt, says that the longer it takes you to take action on climate change the greater the cost will be.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just met with a delegation of parliamentary leaders from Fiji, and I asked them: what are the issues that are topical for Fijians? And the number one issue is climate change. Communities in Fiji, on the smaller islands, are now being displaced by climate change. Fijians do not contribute to climate change; they contribute very little, as do most Pacific Islanders. And they cannot believe that a wealthy nation like Australia, with 22-odd million people, a much bigger country with a much bigger industrial base, is ignoring their pleas, that it is stepping backwards on climate change. It is one of the only developed nations in the world that is moving backwards on climate change. And the people who are feeling the effects are people like the Fijians I just met with. Australians talk about climate change as something that may occur in the future, in 20 or 30 years. But for people like Fijians and Pacific Islanders, climate change is not a looming threat; it is a present danger. It is happening now. Their plea to us today was that Australia needs to do more on climate change, and I could not agree with them more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And here we have the government wiping out that revenue, $6.3 billion from the budget, and asking Australian taxpayers to fund their new policy. They have done it also in the area of mining tax, where they have given nine of the biggest multinational mining corporations in the country a tax break and are asking Australian taxpayers to pay moreâfor university degrees, for visits to the GP, through a petrol tax increase and through a high-income-earner increase.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills completely highlight the manner in which this government is managing our economy. They are asking the most vulnerable in our society to pay the costs. It is unfair. That is why the Shorten-led opposition has been so emphatic in its opposition to many of these budget measures, because they target the most vulnerable in our community. They target the poor . They target middle-income families and ask them to make a contribution to make up for structural issues within the budget. But at the same time they let off some of the most wealthy and profitable sectors and businesses in our economyâmost notably, mining companies and large producers of fossil fuels. Their priorities when it comes to tackling the issue of the budget deficit, their priorities when it comes to ensuring that the budget is on a more sustainable footing into the future, are all wrong. It is not that the opposition is opposed to making changes to the budget, to making changes to many of the programs that are being delivered by government. It is about the approach the government is taking in doing that, by targeting the most vulnerable and poor within our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the opposition has said no to changes to Medicare, to changes to higher education fees and to changes to petrol taxes and the like. And that is why we will continue to campaign for fairness and good policy. We saw it today in Labor's release of a policy on tackling multinational tax avoidance. This is an issue the Treasurer put on the agenda at the G20 this year as something world economies need to focus on. But then when the heat came from big business in Australia he walked straight away from it, because he did not want to upset those who had been particularly big donors to the Liberal Party. And that is wrong. You cannot run an economy that way, and that is why Labor has been opposed to many of the changes that have been introduced by the government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="241589" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McNAMARA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  I rise to support appropriation bills No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4 and in doing so highlight the many ways in which this government is delivering for Dobell. In September 2013 the people of the Central Coast voted for a better future, strong representation and a government that would deliver real solutions to address our region's issues. Since my election I have worked hard to deliver directly to Dobell over $72 million worth of infrastructure and community programs. After many years of neglect by the previous government, the families, businesses and residents of Dobell are now receiving proper representation and delivery of much-needed infrastructure and community grants. And I am pleased to say that the government has deliveredâor  is in some case in the process of deliveringâall our election commitments, and we are already starting to see the results.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In total, over $16 million has been invested in local roads. Prior to the election, the government pledged to upgrade The Ridgeway at Tumbi Umbi and Jensen Road at Wadalba. These are two local roads that, as a result of population growth, have seen increased utilisation. Our investment means that local residents can now travel more safely around our community; $1.9 million has been allocated to address notorious road black spots at Berkeley Vale, Holgate, Charmhaven, Toukley and Wadalba. And Gosford and Wyong shire councils have received an allocation of $12 million in Roads to Recovery funding to allow for the maintenance and upgrade of our local roads network. This is in addition to the Financial Assistance Grants which will see the two councils receive $23 million over five years to invest in local infrastructure projects in Dobell.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday I joined with the Hon. Jamie Briggs MP, Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, to announce that work on NorthConnex had commenced. NorthConnex is something that members opposite know quite well. For six years they talked about delivering the M1 to M2 'missing link' but never delivered. In just 17 months this government has delivered $405 million to the project, finalised plans, secured contracts and ensured that construction is underway. NorthConnex will generate approximately 8,700 jobs for New South Wales, providing a boost to local businesses. The twin nine-kilometre tunnels, running under Pennant Hills Road, will bypass 21 sets of traffic lights, provide an alternative route to the Pacific Highway and save motorists at least 15 minutes of travel time. But, most importantly, NorthConnex will mean a reduction in commuting times for the approximately 15,000 Central Coast motorists who commute south from the region on a daily basis. And, for the people of Dobell who commute south every working day, NorthConnex will mean shorter and safer travelling options, less time in traffic and more time with their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to NorthConnex, the federal government is also spending $195.8 million on the M1 Productivity Package, which will see much-needed upgrades to stretches along the M1 Pacific Motorway and, notably for the commuters of Dobell, an upgrade of the M1 between Tuggerah and Warnervale from four to six lanes. This government is focused on delivering productivity-boosting infrastructure, which will create and support jobs on the Central Coast, and throughout New South Wales and Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Creating jobs is one of my highest priorities to address, in particular, the youth unemployment issues on the Central Coast. In working closely with schools and education providers it is paramount that we support school leavers with their transition to work and further education. That is why I lobbied for and secured $2.7 million to support new skills and training centres in Dobell. Working with Central Coast Group Training, the Central Coast largest employer of apprentices, the government has already delivered a new jobs and employment centre at Tuggerah. In addition, planning is now underway for a second skills centre, to be located at North Wyong. These two centres are integral in addressing our region's above average youth unemployment rate by providing achievable outcomes and, importantly, skills and job opportunities to our young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Government programs have, for too long, lacked coordination and failed to significantly reduce youth unemployment. This is an issue I am working to resolve. Dobell is one of 18 priority employment areas across Australia to have implemented the Work for the Dole program. This means that 18- to 30-year-olds who have been unemployed for 12 months or more and who are receiving Newstart and/or youth allowance are now required to participate in Work for the Dole. I strongly believe that all Australians capable of working should be earning, learning or participating in Work for the Dole. Work for the Dole is an important part of this government's plan to assist young people gain the skills and experience they need to move from welfare to work. In addition to Work for the Dole, many young job seekers are receiving hands-on experience through the government's Green Army Program. Dobell has already benefited from six round 1 projects, which have seen environmental work undertaken at the Central Coast Wetlands, Kanwal, Noraville and The Entrance North.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been privileged to spend time in the field with Green Army participants and to hear firsthand the importance of the experience they are receiving through the program. I have also had the opportunity to welcome the Hon. Greg Hunt MP, Minister for the Environment, to visit our local projects and observe firsthand the value of the program for local participants. Some of those who are participating are studying environmental sciences and are using this program to gain practical experience.  Meanwhile, others have joined the program to improve their skills and increase their chances of finding permanent employment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I was able to announce an additional four projects for the Dobell electorate under round 2 of the Green Army Program. I will continue to work with local environment groups to deliver Green Army projects and provide this important experience for young job seekers interested in a career in land conservation, horticulture and the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about the natural environment in Dobell, we are always drawn to Tuggerah Lakes, the jewel in our crown. I am happy to inform the House that the $3.3 million, delivered by this government, to improve Tuggerah Lakes through the Coastal River Recovery program is already delivering results.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the years, rapid urban development on the lake's foreshore has contributed to the degradation of Canton Beach, with an infestation of sea wrack. Prior to the 2013 federal election, I took Minister Hunt to Canton Beach to witness this damage. Last year I was able to welcome Minister Hunt back to the same spot at Canton Beach to inspect the results of the reprofiling and regeneration of Canton Beach. The results are truly amazing. For the first time in many years people are now using this beach, enjoying swimming and kayaking on Tuggerah Lakes. We said that we would restore the lakes to their former glory and we are on track to achieving this. Our funding will enable similar reprofiling and regeneration to be undertaken at other lake beaches, including Long Jetty and The Entrance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The revitalisation of Tuggerah Lakes is vital to the Central Coast economy.  Our economy is highly dependent on tourism. By improving the condition of Tuggerah Lakes we aim to attract visitors to the area to experience the beauty of the lakes and, in turn, support our local small businesses and tourist operators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also delivered $700,000 to complete the upgrade of the Norah Head Boat Ramp. The boat ramp is the only sea-access point in the Dobell electorate and is an essential piece of economic infrastructure. The new boat ramp ensures all-weather access to the ocean off Norah Head and encourages people to take advantage of one of our best assets, which is our natural environment. Sports tourism and the ability to host regional and national sporting championships is my vision for the Central Coast.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through my personal lobbying, the government has provided $1 million to commence planning studies for the Tuggerah Sports Precinct. This is a project that will deliver economic benefits to the Central Coast through increased sports tourism and, importantly, more jobs. The Tuggerah Sports Precinct will not only enable the hosting of regional and national sports events; it will also provide local sporting clubs access to high-quality sports fields and facilities for local competitions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This investment will help realise my determination, as the member for Dobell, for the Central Coast to become the sports tourism capital of New South Wales. However, there is more to deliver. For the 9,000 businesses in Dobell, which is the engine room of the Dobell economy, this government is implementing measures to provide support, and practical measures to assist them to thrive and prosper. Over $285,000 has been delivered through export market development grants and a further $150,000 through T-QUAL tourism grants to support local businesses in Dobell.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month I welcomed the Hon. Bruce Billson MP, Minister for Small Business, to Dobell, to meet with local business owners and representatives. It is extremely important that we maintain open, consultative dialogue with small businesses. We are improving the environment in which small business operates, and a key component of these changes is our deregulation agenda. Since the election the government have announced over 400 red tape reduction measures, which has resulted in a net reduction of over $2.1 billion in compliance costs. Last October, the government removed approximately 1,000 pieces and over 7,200 pages of legislation and regulation. This was in addition to our first repeal day last March, when over 10,000 pieces and 50,000 pages of legislation and regulation were scrapped, resulting in over $700 million of compliance savings. Unnecessary regulation stifles productivity, deters investment and innovation, and presents barriers to job creation. I understand that you cannot have a strong and healthy society without a strong economy to sustain it, and you do not have a strong economy without profitable business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, I am working to ensure stronger and safer communities. Through the government's Safer Streets Program, local communities and business centres throughout Dobell will share in $370,000 of new CCTV equipment. This will improve safety at Berkeley Vale, Wadalba and Blue Haven, and will boost business confidence in the Wyong CBD, the Toukley business precinct and the Kanwal shopping centre. Wyong Shire Council will receive funding for mobile CCTV equipment and a new graffiti trailer to combat localised crime, illegal dumping and graffiti. This is just a small snapshot of the $72 million investment over the last 17 months in Dobell and of practical support being provided to local businesses. However, I am also committed to strengthening my local community and empowering people with opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As federal members of parliament we spend much of our time here in Canberra. This makes the time we spend in our electorate and amongst our community extremely special and most rewarding. One of the highlights of my role is visiting local schools. Since my election, I have worked closely with principals, teachers, students and parents to ensure our children have access to quality education. Our local schools are outstanding. We have dedicated and professional staff who are committed to seeing our school students succeed and our school community grow and prosper. I am proud of the many achievements of young people in my electorate: people like Nathan Conner and Maddison O'Gradey-Lee, who I have spoken about previously in parliament. These young people are outstanding role models for others of their age. I am committed to working with the youth in my electorate and, through the establishment of the Dobell Youth Advisory Committee, I am receiving quality feedback from tomorrow's leaders on the issues that matter to them. It is important to understand and appreciate that the decisions we make today will impact upon our children and future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is imperative that we engage with them and include them in our decision making, and also that we all understand the importance of getting national debt under control so that our legacy to younger Australian is prosperity, not poverty. On many occasions, it has been my pleasure to share with the House the inspirational stories of local groups and volunteers who dedicate their time to strengthening our community. As a community, we are determined to combat unemployment, mental health issues, family violence and child abuse. These are important issues which I have raised previously in this parliament. Unfortunately, there are no easy fixes, but it is imperative that we maintain constant vigilance and keep these issues at the forefront of the public's mind. Inspirational organisations in my electorate such as Share the Love, LEAP, the Iris Foundation, the Glen Centre, the Wyong Neighbourhood Centre, Next Step, Coast Shelter and Lifeline, just to name a few, have dedicated staff and volunteers who spend their time helping others. These people are the glue that hold our community together and make Dobell the great electorate that it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is exciting that this year marks the Centenary of Anzac, a time where we will all come together and commemorate the legend of Anzac. This will be a once-in-a-lifetime event that will unite us in a common cause. I have had the fortune of working with the dedicated members of our local returned service organisationsâin particular, the Entrance-Long Jetty, Toukley, Wyong, Wamberal-Terrigal RSL sub-branches and the Tuggerah Lakes Nashos. The Centenary of Anzac allows us to join with Australians young and old to commemorate our coming of age. The Anzac Centenary grants program will mean all in our community can join in this commemoration. The residents of Dobell should be extremely proud of the time and effort being put into this commemoration by our returned service organisations and the opportunity they will have to mark this special occasion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just a small sample of the tremendous things happening in Dobell. I will continue to work closely with people in my electorate and to be a strong voice here in Canberra. I look forward to the many opportunities I will have to highlight the achievements of the people of Dobell. I am proud to call the Central Coast home, and I will continue to fight for and deliver for Dobell so we can all share in a more prosperous future. I commend these bills the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  It is now March and we are still talking about last May's rotten, failed and unfair budgetâas we should be, because it is what the people we represent are talking about and what they are rightly worried about and troubled by. At kitchen tables and lunch rooms it is the unfairness of this government's policies as expressed in this budget that dominates concerns. Let me be clear: Labor rejects the uncaring austerity of the Prime Minister and his Treasurer. Labor rejects the dishonesty that underpins all thisâthe saying of one thing before the election and doing another after it. And we stand here, firstly, to hold the government to account for its broken promises made before the election but unpicked through this budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government stood, the day before the election, when through the now Prime Ministerâthen the Leader of the Oppositionâsaid there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no change to pensions and no cuts to the ABC or SBS, then did the opposite through this budget. Labor is committed to calling out those broken promises. Labor is committed to reversing this deficit of trust and to standing up for fairness and trust in governmentâan approach that puts people first. Labor is standing up for universal health care, for accessible higher education, for needs-based school funding, support for pensions and the vulnerable and, critically, for fighting for jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is in this context that I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3), the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and the Appropriation of Parliamentary Departments Bill (No. 2). These bills propose appropriations from consolidated revenue in addition to those appropriated through the appropriations act that were part of the 2014-15 budget. These bills reflect decisions made as part of the MYEFO which was released on 15 December last year. They also reflect, in part, changes to the machinery of government as part of the ministry reshuffle that was announced on 21 December and that took effect two days later.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, bill No. 3 seeks approval to appropriate just under $1.4 billion for the 2014-15 financial year and bill No. 4 seeks to appropriate just under $241 million for the 2014-15 financial year. The parliamentary departments bill is for appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the four parliamentary departments: the Department of the Senate, the Department of the House of Representatives, the Department of Parliamentary Services and the Parliamentary Budget Office. The shadow minister, in his contribution to this debate, has touched on those matters that are the subject of these appropriations in more detail. These bills assist with the business and the operations of government, and none of this is particularly controversial in and of itself. We do not, of course, oppose these appropriations. However, it does provide an important opportunity to all of us elected to this place to reflect on the business of government generally and, in particular, the business of this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was fortunate to be in the chamber for the contribution of the member for Kingsford Smith, who drew out two critical elements of this government's decision making as evidenced in the budget. He spoke passionately and powerfully about the impact of cuts to foreign aidâof course the largest cut in this budgetâand the impact of these cuts on lives in developing countries, in particular, our neighbours in the South Pacific. These are people who are voiceless in this parliament. He highlighted, which I think was especially important, the impact that these foreign aid cuts will have on women in developing countries. He also spoke about climate change. It was interesting that a few weeks ago, some members of the governmentâI think including the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurerâstarted talking about fairness, trying to recast the fairness debate. For them it seemed that this was all about debt and intergenerational fairness. Indeed, the member for Dobell, in her contribution, seemed to touch on these issues. This interest in fairness was newfound a couple of weeks ago and seems to have been short-lived, because we have heard very little of it in this debate. But the real issue of intergenerational fairness goes to the question of how we combat climate change. The member for Kingsford Smith very persuasively set out why it is so critical to act early and in accordance with both economic and scientific adviceâtwo things which are beyond this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a government which is obsessed with emphasising that Australia is living beyond its means. It says that Australia has a spending problem, yet it refuses to seriously countenance issues of revenue. The Treasurer, as we saw today, likes to beat his chest on multinational tax avoidance. But where is the action to tackle this problem? Last Tuesday the Treasurer was asked by a government member about exactly this, and once again he gave us the benefit of his stale and increasingly unconvincing tough cop routine. There was as usual much heat but very little light. Of course, we saw more of the same in question time today. There is a pattern of behaviour here. In February last year, 13 months ago now, the Treasurer stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Some global companies aren't paying their fair share of tax anywhere â¦ I am pleased to say this work is on track for delivery at the Brisbane summit at the end of this year â¦ The globe needs to know who is paying tax where.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure that multinational tax minimisers were quaking in their boots when the Treasurer stated later last year:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Itâs hugely important for the globe that companies pay tax on their profits. It is theft when someone does not pay the tax due to the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely we could expect this government to act on this theft. Instead we saw early in its life the exact opposite, as the Abbott government reopened tax loopholes closed by Labor in government, allowing $1.1 billion in potential revenue to drain offshore. The Treasurer spoke of balance in this debate today. Perhaps this is the balance he was seeking to achieve. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other hand, today we have heard that Labor is taking this seriously through the work of the shadow Treasurer, the shadow Assistant Treasurer and of course the Leader of the Opposition, with their announcement of an approach that has been developed in consultation with multinational tax practitioners, academics and industry, and costed of course by the independent Parliamentary Budget Office. It is an approach which draws on the OECD's global plans for countering base erosion and profit shifting. It is a sensible approach to a real problem and is in stark contrast to this government's bluster on the one hand and inaction on the other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are numerous examples overseas of foreign tax evasion issues being uncovered. Just recently we have seen the leaked HSBC documents expose tax evasion occurring in the UK and around the world. I note that British MPs under a Conservative government will be holding an inquiry into this. This has been a big deal overseas and it should be a much bigger deal here tooâhopefully it will be following Labor's leadership todayâparticularly for a government that must be seeking to address a serious revenue shortfall. But as yet there has been no effective response from the government, other thanâand I will touch on this laterâto starve the Australian Taxation Office of resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely underpinning all of this are questions of priorities. We have a so-called budget emergency, yet the Abbott government does not actually want to go after potential sources of revenue. Instead, this government goes after what it sees as soft targetsâpensioners, students, the employed, particularly young unemployed people, who would be offered the prospect of six months without any form of supportâand, of course, as I touched on earlier and as the member for Kingsford Smith touched on at some greater length, the world's most poor, the largest and perhaps the cruellest cut in this budget. This list goes on. But because the Abbott government has incorrectly, as I believe it will be seen to be, made the very cynical calculation that it can get away with these cuts, it goes right ahead. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people have taken stark exception to this toxic government and its toxic budget. I remind the House that this is a budget that all members of the government have supported and have publicly advocated for. There is a great irony here: the Prime Minister and the Treasurer claiming that there is an emergency when it is they who have gone some large distance towards creating one. In government Labor recognised that our economy faced very serious headwinds and made some difficult decisions, but Labor did not attack low- and middle-income earners, because it is unfair to ask them to bear this burden. It is for this government to start to explain why it chose, as just one example, to cut pensions but not look at tax loopholes for the wealthy, particularly in superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most Australians, of course, are low- and middle-income earners. They are the backbone of our society and they are under siege by this government. We now hear talk of a families package from those opposite but, frankly, nothing they do now will alter the state of play in Australia. This is from a government, I remind members, that wants to make families, on average, $6,000 a year worse off. After 18 months, Australian families have a good idea about this government's priorities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consumer confidence is lower now than it was at the time of the last election, and this is hurting the economy. So much for the much-promised adrenalin charge that this government was going to bring. Who could blame consumers, and who could blame people, for lacking confidence with a government like this one? It was revealed last week that wage growth, unbeknownst to the Treasurer, is the lowest it has been on record, despite their rhetoric around industrial relations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unemployment is the highest it has been for 13 yearsâback to the time when the member for Warringah was the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations; it seems that he has an unfortunate knack for high unemploymentâand youth unemployment is higher still. Despite this, we see cuts to vital programs like Youth Connections and we see victim blaming in terms of the treatment of young unemployed people. While the member for Dobell might laud programs like the Green Army and Work for the Dole, this ignores the evidence that these programs have done very little for unemployment, particularly for youth unemployment and other cohorts, like Indigenous people. They prefer ideology to rhetoric in this as in other aspects of decision making. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot ignore the impact that this budget has made on the economy. It has torpedoed consumer confidence, which has had flow-on effects throughout the economy. This government has made the same mistake that its counterparts made in Europe: it cut during a downturn. They cut in Europe, and it drove many of European economies back into recession. It did not work there, and it is not working here; it is leaving an enormous human cost. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recklessness of this government is particularly acute because these lessons from Europe had already been learnt by those in Europe. Former advocates who prescribed the so-called tough medicine have conceded as much, yet this government refused to listen or learn from their mistakes or, indeed, from the Australian people. It is very telling that on the occasion of one of the Prime Minister's many failed resets or reboots, when he gave his address to the National Press Club, he spoke of having spent his summer talking to hundreds of Australiansâtalking to, not talking with and certainly not listening to or hearing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke briefly earlier on the impact of cuts to the ATO on raising revenue. It is worth noting in the context of this debate that the government is slashing the number of people working in the Australian Taxation Officeâby 4,700 by 2017, in fact. Of these, one quarter will come from the audit team, which has already lost 500 staff members to meet an arbitrary target imposed by the government. Alarmingly, that is expected to rise to 1,000 in the audit team alone. The audit team, of course, is responsible for investigating and enforcing tax compliance by individuals and multinational companies and, unbelievably, the Treasurer has told the tax commissioner to double his efforts through more stringent audits of multinational companies suspected of avoiding Australian tax collections. So this government complains about tax-dodging multinationals one minute and the next it cuts the ability of the ATO to do anything about it. Not for the first time, it is what this government does, rather than what it says, which is instructive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the targets of this government's budget that has particular relevance to the Scullin electorate is pensioners, but it is also future generations trying to save for their retirement. This government is implementing a trifecta of cruelty: cutting the pension, which will hurt current and future pensioners; and cutting the low income superannuation contribution and freezing the rate of compulsory superannuation contributions, both of which will hurt people trying to save for their retirement. Whatever people do, there is pain for them from this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was Labor who introduced compulsory superannuation in this country amidst much opposition from the Liberal Party and big business lobby groups. I note that it is the same Liberal Party and big business lobby groups that we see today claiming that the pension system is unsustainable. In the lead-up to the 1996 election, John Howard promised that he would match Labor's pledge to increase the compulsory superannuation contribution to 12 per cent. It was a promise that he broke immediately upon coming to government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Member for Warringah has in this place described compulsory superannuation as:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ one of the biggest con jobs ever foisted by government on the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals have always had a hatred of superannuation but also a hatred for the pension system. It is unclear what exactly they expect people to do, apart from live in a state of destitution and penuryâsomething that they have been explicit about for young jobless people. People should be encouraged, where they can afford it, to put money towards their retirement. A policy which did this effectively was the low income superannuation contribution. It was especially aimed at those on low incomes as they are most likely to have insufficient superannuation funds with which to retire on. Labor recognised that we were facing a demographic challenge of people retiring without funds to support their retirement, so we acted to address it. This is one example that demonstrates the difference between Labor and Liberal. In opposing the policies of this dysfunctional government, we do not seek to block supply but we use this opportunity to highlight the impact of this budget on ordinary Australians and on the Australian economy.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2014-2015 and the cognate bills currently before the House for debate. As we enter our third week of parliament for 2015, I think it is timely to discuss what I hope to achieve for the people of Hinkler during the rest of my first term. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I entered politics because I wanted to give back to the community that has given me and my family so much. I started my career as an electrical apprentice at Fairymead Sugar Mill, before studying engineering at Queensland University of Technology. In 2002, I established the Australian Safety &amp; Training Alliance, a company that went on to train over 10,000 people in industrial and VET training. Committed to community service, I was a surf lifesaver for over 10 years. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe it is this life experience that makes me a common-sense voice here in the Australian parliament. I am a practical person and I have little patience for lengthy bureaucratic processes that cost the taxpayers bucketfuls of money. I just want to get on with it, and get the job done. I strongly align with the Liberal National Party's conservative philosophy that hard work should be rewarded. I believe in a hand up and not a handout. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have delivered on all of the election commitments I made to the people of Hinkler. I am committed to fight every day to ensure regional Australia gets its fair share so it can continue to be the engine room of the nation's economy. But my main priority has been attracting investment to the Hinkler region and making it easier for people to do business and to create jobs and opportunities for current and future generations. The issues that I will continue to focus on are unemployment, the exploitation of workers in the horticulture sector, country-of-origin food labelling, petrol prices, electricity costs and the need, of course, for more aged-care beds in my electorate of Hinkler. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the unemployment space, the coalition has made many worthwhile changes, including Work for the Dole. In the first round, of only 18 locations Australia wide we secured two for the Hinkler electorate. I disagree with the member for Scullinâthese are programs that have absolute value for people who need to learn the life skills needed to go to work. I quote the former mayor and current state member for Hervey Bay, Ted Sorensen, who has said that Work for the Dole programs give people confidence; they give them a social mechanism, a way to work with other workers, to enjoy a beer after work even, and to gain employment. Every single person that he had placed when he was at council ended up with a full-time position. That is a ringing endorsement of the Work for the Dole scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Green Army is another great program, and I was very happy to be at Baldwin Swamp park in recent weeks, where I met with a number of people who are working on the program who are incredibly happy to be involved, as are their parents. There are, of course, job commitment bonuses for the long-term unemployed and loans of up to $20,000 to help apprentices complete their trade, with significant discounts when they complete their training. As a former apprentice, I can tell you that my first vehicle was a 1970 HT Holden with a 186 and three on the tree. It was not a 186S, it was just a plain old 186 in cream and white. As a first year apprentice earning some $63 a week on a short week and $74 in a long week, it was very difficult to meet your commitments and bills. Trade loans would have been a fantastic opportunity at the time for me to purchase a vehicle which I would have known was reliable and did not need work. I clearly remember my HT needing a couple of things done, and that took me eight months. I spent the rest of the time riding a motorbike to work in the cold and wet, which was all very disappointing. So there are costs in being an apprentice, but it is great to end up with a trade, and the $20,000 trade loans will be invaluable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A scholarship scheme for university students from low socioeconomic backgrounds and regional communities is another commitment of this government. Once again, I attended university as a self-funded student. I saved that money during the last two years of my apprenticeship and paid my way through. To have an opportunity to receive a scholarship would have been very helpful to me and my family. We are providing funding to cover the costs associated with relocating to take up a job; we have introduced financial incentives for business too, so if they hire a job seeker over the age of 50 who has been unemployed for at least six months there is some incentive to get that person employed. In an electorate like Hinkler, where the median age is four to five years above that of the state, this is an important measure. There is a $476 million Industry Skills Fund, and I congratulate the minister for industry. As someone who has owned and operated a registered training organisation working in heavy industry, I know this is a real program that provides real skillsâ$476 million towards skills needed to get forklift operator licences and driver's licencesâthings that will get you employment. We are overhauling the VET system and Labor's Jobs Services Australia, which in my mind has wasted billions and billions of dollars of taxpayers' money. We do not need 3,000 baristas to be trained in the electorate of Hinklerâwe need them to be trained in things which gain them employment; real skills for real jobs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobs are desperately needed in my region, which is why we must continue to support business. Prior to the Queensland election, the former LNP state government committed $11 million for a gas pipeline to the Port of Bundaberg. Many multinational businesses had previously expressed an interest in establishing at the port, but they said the lack of infrastructure was a major impediment. We have very good news on that frontâa major multinational, Knauf Australia, announced during the campaign that they would be building a manufacturing plant at the Bundaberg Port as a result of the announcement on gas infrastructure. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Kelly, it is exceptionally difficult to get a large project over the line. This is a project that is worth between $70 million and $100 million. It will employ 200 people for construction, there will be 65 permanent jobs and it will add somewhere around two per cent to the GDP of our local electorate. This program is over the lineâthe DA is done, the environmental approval is done, wharf access is done, the design is done and the pier tests are done. It is fully funded from their point of view. The sod-turning announcement is over. But now there is significant concern that the newly elected state Labor government will not continue with the gas project, which could be a real blow to the local economy and local jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The gas pipeline, which is absolutely essential, was announced as a direct result of strong representation by me and my colleagues former state member for Bundaberg Jack Dempsey and re-elected state member for Burnett Stephen Bennett. The pipeline was to be funded through the Royalties for Regions program, which Labor has said it will abolish. I call on newly-elected Labor member for Bundaberg, Leanne Donaldson, to ensure the pipeline is funded. It was not an election commitmentâit was fully funded and had been announced months before the election campaign commenced. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other state projects at risk locally include: the extension of the Kay McDuff Drive, connecting it to the ring road; and flood mitigation projects like cleaning out an old agricultural drain at Moore Park Beach, clearing the Millaquinn Bend, and the floodgates around East Bundaberg. In the southern end of the electorate, around Torbanlea, there was an announcement to improve the causeway near the Torbanlea school. That now looks like it is in jeopardy. Also at risk are negotiations about a land swap to turn sensitive land behind the Mon Repo turtle rookery into a conservation zone, as well as the planned upgrade to the Mon Repo turtle rookery visitor centre; a hydrotherapy pool in Childers; and $26 million to upgrade three Hervey Bay intersections, one of which is an incredibly dangerous intersection, where Urraween Road intersects with the Maryborough-Hervey Bay Road. This is a very important intersection and I would ask the new Queensland state government to ensure that it is funded.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The local state Labor candidates did not make any funding commitments during the election campaign, other than to employ more public servants. Annastacia Palaszczuk said they would not sell assets or increase taxes, but at the same time they would pay down debt and deliver a surplus. I guess that means they will cut government spending, because there are no other options. They are the only three that are available. However, I note that Ms Donaldson let the cat out of the bag when she told a community forum that they would borrow to build infrastructure. It is the same old Laborâthey will try to put it on the credit card.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issues around the exploitation of workers, food labelling and petrol prices all tie back to one thing: the absolute market domination by the supermarket duopoly. Their influence is far too great. They are squeezing our farmers and manufacturers for every last cent, forcing them to the brink. They are increasingly sourcing their products from overseas at a significantly lower cost, where labour is cheap and biosecurity and health regulations are almost non-existent. Our local businesses cannot compete. I only have to look at Kevin Cast, who was the owner of the IGA at Bargara. Kevin was a well-known local businessman who ran a professional turnout and employed lots of local people. Unfortunately a Woolworths store was built right next door to his store in Bargara, and consequently after a couple of years he is out of business. I believe he has declared bankruptcy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The independent grocery sector employs more people per dollar of turnover than any of the major chains </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Independent grocers usually live in their local communities, and their profits stay in those communities. The major chains' profits are sent back to head office; smaller communities are disadvantaged by major chain development, because those profits leave town. Independent grocers stock locally produced fresh meat and vegetables when they are available, whereas the major chains have centrally supplied fresh produce, which bypasses local and even state producers for large-scale producers. This is an issue which directly affects fatigue in the transport sector. The reason we need to continue to put bandaids on the transport sector is the fact that the delivery windows are so small, most times they cannot be met. If you are a long-haul truck driver, it is incredibly difficult to meet the requirements of Coles and Woolworths.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I see today that we have announced that there is a new Food and Grocery Code of Conduct. I am very pleased to see that that is out and about. The Food and Grocery Code of Conduct will come into force from tomorrow, to ensure fair and transparent commercial dealings between retailers, wholesalers and suppliers in the Australian grocery sector. The features of the code include an obligation to enter into grocery supply agreements in writing. The code also provides minimum standards of behaviour in dealings with suppliers, including an obligation to act in good faith and a prohibition against threatening suppliers with business disruption or termination without reasonable groundsâsomething I have seen a lot of. The code also features dispute-resolution mechanisms to assist suppliers in resolving disputes. Unfortunately, the reality is that to prosecute something under the ACCCâin its current formâcosts between $5 and $10 million. Quite simply, if you are up for costs, you cannot afford it. The code is comprehensive and covers contractual dealings such as supplier-funded promotions; labelling; shelf space and positioning; intellectual property; and payments for wastage. The ACCC will be able to take enforcement action for breaches of the code by the retailers and wholesalers who have signed it. It will help to prevent instances of unconscionable conduct, and enhance the ACCC's capacity to take action against misleading or deceptive conduct, and misuse of market power. The code will be reviewed three years after commencement.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The exploitation of workers in the horticultural sector by labour hire contractors is something which I have spoken about in this place many times. Growers are being forced to cut their costs wherever possible, and they rely on contract labour firms to get that done. Quite simply, it is unacceptable. There is slavery in this country, and it is through labour hire contractors, particularly in the hort. sector. It cannot continue and we must act.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, petrol pricing in the local district is a big issue for us. In December, local media reported that a Woolworths spokesperson told them that Woolworths would only reduce prices to reflect the crude oil price when other local retailers did the same. Can you believe thatâthey will only reduce their prices if someone else reduces theirs! The local price actually increased during the floods, and the ACCC's first <span style="font-style:italic;">Quarterly report on the Australian petroleum industry </span>clearly shows that regional Australians are being robbed at the bowser. They are being robbed. In July 2014 in Brisbane, the price was 153.3 cents per litre. In January 2015, it was 112.4âa drop of 40.9 cents per litre. In Bundaberg, that difference was just 34.7 cents per litre; in Childers it was 34.9; and in Hervey Bay it was an astounding 27.1 cents per litre. Given that the price changes are solely to do with the wholesale price, that is completely unacceptable. Regional Australia has been robbed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The quarterly examination of fuel pricing by the ACCC was the direct result of intense lobbying. My coalition backbench colleagues and I asked Minister Bruce Billson to issue a directive to the consumer watchdog. In addition to the quarterly report, Minister Billson has also asked the ACCC to conduct at least three specific regional market studies each year into the significant price differences between regional areas and our capital cities. Those reports will examine price anomalies, price gouging, anticompetitive behaviour and other market irregularities, as well as the slowness of major retailers in reducing regional fuel prices as the international price has fallen. I have asked Minister Billson and the ACCC to select Hinkler as a location for further examination. The first regional location will be announced soon, after the ACCC has completed its enquiries. Of course, it is not our local retailers who are doing the wrong thing; it is the major wholesalers and the duopoly. They control far too much market power, not just in groceries but also in fuel and in a number of other areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to talk about the issue of electricity, something which is near and dear to my heart, and to my constituents. The cost of living is an issue which affects everybody, but in an electorate where the median income is under $500 a week, the price you pay for electricity is very important. The price has been affected by the Renewable Energy Target; there is no doubt about that. Simply to run the department that looks after the RET and the RECs costs $513 million, according to the last budget paper. In the last minute remaining to me, the question I have is this: where is the Electrical Trades Union on this? Where is the ETU? They are the ones who are supposed to be out supporting their membersâsupporting the people who work in the power industryâand they are letting this slip by. They are far more interested in trying to win elections than they are in being out and representing their membersâand they are the ones that are at risk. I expect the ETU to get up and do what they are supposed to and represent their membership, because the renewable energy system that we have at the moment is broken. That is the bottom line. It will not work, seen from any practical backgroundâand it is something I have a lot of knowledge about. It is very simple: if you intend to produce electricity only between ten o'clock and two o'clock, without a storage system, what do you intend to do with it? The peak use is early in the morning and after six o'clock at night. That is when you require electricity and, quite simply, it will not be produced at that time. The system is broken. We need to get on with fixing it. I would ask those on the other side to line up with Minister Macfarlane and try and sort this out. It is costing billions of dollars to consumers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="ECV" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>):  We are on the cusp of the 2015 budget being brought downâand yet this government has yet to sell last year's budget to the community. This government fails to understand that budgets are about people and they are about community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, you will appreciate the fact that I regularly speak in this place about the spirit of multiculturalism in my electorate. I have the honour of representing the most multicultural electorate in the country. My community is shaped by the diversity of our people, their cultures and their traditions. However, behind the colour and vibrancy of our community there are significant pockets of disadvantageâareas of high unemployment, families from low socio-economic backgrounds, and a high proportion of people living with disabilities. While there is much to be proud about, there is certainly no denying the fact that my community is one of genuine need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to office 18 months ago, the Abbott government has done very little other than introduce policies that will detrimentally impact on the wellbeing of communities such as mineâproposals like cutting education funding, deregulating university fees, cutting healthcare funding, developing a GP tax, targeting family benefits, and abolishing the Schoolkids Bonus. These have all impacted sharply on my electorate. Added to that are the various cuts to family payments. By the way, as a further indication of that, a single-income family earning $65,000 per year with two children are $6,000 worse off as a consequence of the cuts that have been applied by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to a budget that cares for, or caters to, people and communities, this government is certainly not taking care of communities such as mineâcommunities with significant pockets of disadvantage. Using the example of that family with an income of $65,000, you should not forget that that family is almost 10 per cent worse off. If you take the Schoolkids Bonus into accountâ$410 per primary schoolkid or $820 for a high school studentâthen that family is even further disadvantaged. That is why I say this government is doing everything to make life harder for struggling familiesâwith cuts to education and health, cuts to community organisations that do provide vital services to our communities. I am saying that there is more than a pattern emerging here: this is systematic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have thought that investing in education is traditionally one of the most important things for the nation's futureâone of the most important things we can do for our future. That is why we on this side strongly oppose this government's decision to strip $5.8 billion out of the education sector. While there is a significant amount of disadvantage in my community, I must say we are producing a number of very intelligent young people who are making the most of the education system and who no doubt will go on to do great things in our community. Last year Tram Anh Ly from Canley Vale High School ranked 3rd in the state for her studies in English as a second language together with Quang Huy Do at Cabramatta High School who scored 9th place. Alexander Thai from Canley Vale High School was also placed in the top 10 in the state in extension maths, while Justin Samreth from Bonnyrigg High School was in the top 14 for standard English. Along with these four, there are going to be many other bright local kids who are going to go on to do great things. They will aspire to undertake higher education to fulfil their potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's decision to deregulate university fees is creating the real prospect now of $100,000 degrees, and this will shatter the dreams of many local families. The Abbott government is undermining our higher education system and it will put universities beyond the reach of many Australian familiesâespecially students from disadvantaged backgrounds. With the rising costs of living, these families are already working hard enough to make ends meet. I know there is an election coming just around the corner in New South Wales, but look at what has happened to the TAFE system thereâvocational education. We are seeing a state Liberal government rationalise TAFE campuses; it is cutting or relocating courses, retrenching skilled trade training staff, increasing student fees by an average of 9.5 per cent across the board. Thousands of people are being denied the opportunities for vocational education and for entry positions for apprenticeships. With unemployment the highest it has been for 12 years and youth unemployment running at somewhere between 15 and 16 per cent, it simply does not make sense to attack TAFE or to cut our investment in vocational education or to deny access to training. Privatising our education sector, stripping funds out of tertiary education and shifting costs onto students will not grow our economy. This is inconsistent with what it is to be a smart nation and a nation prepared to invest in its future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many families in my community are also being confronted with increasing family day care expenses, following this government's announcement that it will strip $157 million from family day care services. I have already said that mums and dads in my electorate have to work pretty hard. I recently visited the family day care network in Liverpool and they are staring down the barrel of having either to cut their services due to insufficient funds or to increase their fees. According to the analysis by Family Day Care Australia, the Abbott government will force fees to rise by at least $35 a week. As a consequence there are 133 services in Western Sydney that are now facing closure. This is a real slug to many families in my electorate who are set to lose as much as $741 a year in childcare expenses. These priorities are certainly not consistent with a government that wants to invest in the nation's future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The priorities of this government are most concerning, especially when they are determined to slash funding to essential community services. Again I describe my electorate as being very multicultural and as an area of great need. Since the beginning of this year a number of organisations in the community sector have lost their federal funding following the government's decision to take $170 million out of the Discretionary Grants program. This is impacting on service quality, efficiency and the sustainability of many longstanding organisations in my community. I am referring to organisations like the New South Wales Spanish and Latin American Association for Social Assistance or SALSA which is based in Bonnyrigg. They have lost funding for their aged-care service improvement grant. These grants have been there for many years supporting activities for healthy and active ageing, including dementia care for people from Spanish-speaking backgroundsâand there are many of them in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fairfield and Liverpool migrant resource centres are also receiving less funding for their settlement program and are struggling to keep the quality of their services in the face of the fact that my area is one of the most prominent areas where migrants and refugees are resettledâthat is, in south-west Sydney. The Fairfield Migrant Resource Centre is also facing a second blow with cuts to the emergency relief program. This program exists to provide special food vouchers for families that have hit absolute desperation. That has now been cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another organisation which does an extremely good job in my community and which I would like to refer to is the Vietnamese Community in AustraliaâI know that you know it well, Mr Deputy Speaker Kellyâled by the President, Dr Thang Ha. Not only have they had their settlement grants targeted but they are also facing the government's axe on their money management project, which provides the local community with financial counselling and advice to reduce the impacts of problem gambling in our community. By the way, Vietnamese make up 22 per cent of my electorate, and problem gambling is a major concern. This is an organisation doing something about it. Their program is now completely under threat. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing the VCA does, and does very, very well, is their Links to Learning project. This service is aimed at students at risk of being early school leavers to assist them to stay at school, assist them with their homework and give extracurricular activities. This is all designed to keep kids at school. This service has a profound impact on the lives of many young people and its cessation will come as an extreme disappointment to many, many families in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another organisation which does extremely well is South West Connect, which provides services in the Fairfield and Liverpool areas. It has lost its partnership broker funding. Since the implementation, this has been a very successful program, bringing business together with students to increase student engagement and enhance retention rates at school. Work experience has meant that more than 5,500 local students have become more job ready through the support of 35 corporate partnerships. Without these partnerships, local students miss out on practical engagement with the real world of work. This program directly targets high youth unemployment, linking young people with job prospects and vocational training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are cruel cuts and they are having a devastating impact on our community. It is no wonder the Australian people have lost confidence in this government. The Abbott government has targeted disadvantaged communities, the very people who can least afford to bear the brunt of these attacks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For instance, there is the GP tax, a ludicrous attack on Australia's world-class healthcare system. Who knows what the fate of the GP tax will be, given the Prime Minister's poor polling at the moment? We all know that Tony Abbott will do almost anything for a vote. He has a reputation for saying one thing before an election and doing the exact opposite after. Whatever eventuates in respect of the GP tax, we know that it is the intention of this government when it comes to health care. We know that their intention is to progressively have a user-pays system. We know that this is about putting the cost on the patientsâlike what they intend to do in education, putting the cost on the students. This is all about cost shifting, where you can strip the amount of investment in health and education and put it on the students and patients. Patients on low incomes or with chronic conditions will have to dig pretty deep for high up-front payments just to see GPs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has every right to expect that governments will keep the economy strong, will make smart investments for the future but, above all, will ensure that everybody gets a fair go. On that criterion this government has failed. It has put the job security of Tony Abbott above all else. This is not a government that has lost its way; this is a government that never knew where it was going.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:12</span>):  I am pleased to contribute to debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2014-2015 and cognate bills, but I am going to take a different path to those opposite, who often use this precious speaking time to recite talking points criticising the government and so on. I am going to use the vast majority of my time to convey some good news about Tasmania. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A year ago I stood in this place with this wonderful opportunity, with the appropriation bill, to talk about good things in my community. A year on, I can say to you that there has been excellent progress in Tasmania. It is welcome progress, because whether it is jobs, health, education or levels of disadvantage, Tasmania has lagged behind the mainland states for far too long. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The longstanding nature of these problems is clearly apparent when you consider the 1997 Nixon report, which was undertaken by Fraser government cabinet minister Peter Nixon. Mr Nixon laid out five key reasons for Tasmania's problems. They related to governance, debt, suboptimal education outcomes, a business environment that was unattractive to investors and planning processes that were far too complex. Mr Nixon also highlighted the critical importance of ensuring that Tasmania's debt burden remained manageable, that costs on business were kept as low as possible, that Tasmania's industry development policy was focused on our state's strategic advantages and that local jobs were created to address outbound migration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After 16 years of state Labor government in Tasmania, I am pleased that, with the election of the Hodgman Liberal government and the Abbott-led coalition in Canberra, we are finally making inroads into some of those problems that Mr Nixon highlighted, which have held Tasmania back for far too long. We are finally seeing some of those green shoots of recovery. I am pleased to say that Tasmania is finally off the bottom of the national unemployment tables, with unemployment now at a 28-month low. There is still a lot of work to be done, but the trend is moving in the right direction. Construction work is expanding at the fastest annual rate in eight years, with the state recording an improvement of 15.4 per cent on a year ago. Major projects, both public and private, are underway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want those green shoots of recovery to continue. I want Tasmania to be known for the strength of our economy and our ability to provide for our needs into the future rather than being considered Australia's environmental conscience with more than half of the state permanently locked up in parks and reserves. We have to be an economy and not just a national park.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give you an example of just how we are delivering on that aspiration. Recently my two amigos from Tasmaniaâthe members for Lyons and Braddonâand I welcomed the Prime Minister to northern Tasmania where he announced a major government investment in five irrigation projects. It involved $60 million in federal funding, $30 million from the state Liberal government and about $30 million from people investing in these schemes from the private sector. It was wonderful news for our community because these irrigation schemes will be an enabler of Tasmania's future prosperity. It is vital because when it comes to farming or converting marginal land into something more productive there has to be a reliable magic ingredientâand that ingredient, of course, is water. These schemes will provide 95 per cent water certainty. They will provide the impetus for expansion and diversification of Tasmania's agricultural production. This investment reinforces the government's commitment to infrastructure as a foundation for future growth. These projects will help our community thrive and generate jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How will they do that, you ask? They will allow us to grow more. They will allow us to leverage our advantage, which is clean, green, fresh produce. They will allow us to sell into those growing middle-class markets from India to Asia. Here is Australia perfectly positioned, in what people often refer to as the Asian century, astride the Pacific and Indian oceans. That middle class is currently around 500 million and is projected to grow to 1.7 billion in the next 15 years or so. These projects will enable us to leverage into that trifecta of free trade agreements that Minister Robb negotiated in 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other important thing that this irrigation scheme investment does is demonstrate that we are ending the dam phobia perpetuated by the Greens party and their fellow travellers which has so badly affected our water policy for too many decades. These new irrigation schemes early in their implementation will generate over 150 direct full-time jobs on top of the 7,000 new jobs that have been created since the election of the Hodgman Liberal government in Hobart. So when I say to you that we are making progress with the economic revival of Tasmania it is with some confidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the next couple of minutes I will highlight some of the things that the coalition is doing in this area. I mentioned in some of my recent speeches that Prime Minister Abbott came to Tasmania on 15 of August 2013 and launched the economic recovery plan for my state of Tasmania. It was with some sadness that I heard the then Governor-General when she opened this 44th Parliament singling out one state that needed that help more than most, and that was my state of Tasmania. Since those speeches and since the Prime Minister launched that economic recovery plan, the Major Projects Approval Agency has been established in my home city of Launceston. Since its launch, the agency has been actively supporting projects, with a total investment value of over $700 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tasmania today, we are encouraging people off welfare and into work, including through the Tasmanian Jobs Program, which commenced on 1 January 2014. It offers an incentive payment of $3,250, GST inclusive, to employers who provide full-time, ongoing work to job seekers who have been unemployed for long periods. I can also report that the Joint Commonwealth and Tasmanian Economic Council has been established, with the Prime Minister and Treasurer as members. The council has met on three occasions since the 2013 election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can also tell you that the 2014-15 budget provided $24 million over three years to establish a world-class centre for Antarctic and Southern Ocean research. The funding is being delivered by the University of Tasmania. The government is also progressing the acquisition of a new icebreaker and provided $9.4 million in the 2014-15 budget to maintain Australia's presence in Antarctica.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been $38 million allocated to extend Hobart airport. Development approvals are expected to be sought this year, and the airport's master plan is due to be submitted to the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development in the last quarter of this year. $400m in funding is being provided over the next decade to upgrade the Midland Highway. Goodness me, isn't that long overdue? Projects are being developed with the Tasmanian government, with seven works projects approved by the Commonwealth so far and six projects under construction and expected to be completed by mid-2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have completed the promised Productivity Commission review into Tasmania's shipping and freight. The government is consulting with the Joint Commonwealth and Tasmanian Economic Council and other stakeholders on this report. In that area, I hope that we do something in the near term about fixing the coastal shipping regulations which Labor brought in in 2012. They were a sop to the Maritime Union of Australia. As we have seen, they have driven up the cost of shipping for Bell Bay Aluminium in my electorate of Bass by 63 per cent. So in terms of making shipping more attractive, to get those international ships coming to Tasmania, I hope that that is one of the things that we deal with in the near future. I have certainly been making representations to ministers in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have committed to completing five-yearly reviews and extending the regional forestry agreements to provide resource security and a stable investment environment for the sector, starting with the Tasmanian regional forestry agreement. We have established a fruit and vegetable industry task force, and the Minister for Agriculture released the task force's industry growth plan on 1 October last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over $100 million has been delivered to the University of Tasmania for research funding, including $13 million for the Sense-T project. <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">This</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  "> project centres on better information to consumers about food products, and has the potential to boost information, technology and communications in Tasmania</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">. Mr Deputy Speaker, you </span>can probably sense my excitement about some of the projects that we are rolling out in Tassie because they will make a real difference, particularly in areas that need it most. The north-east of Tasmania is at the top of the list.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the five irrigation schemes that I mentioned before, one of which will be in the Scottsdale region, we announced $34 million for north-east freight roads last December. With an additional $8.5 million on top of that from the Hodgman government, we will be widening Bridport Main Road right across to the East Tamar Highway. Between now and mid-2016 work will be undertaken on Emily Street, Edward Street and Waterhouse Road to facilitate the increasing number of heavy vehicles accessing Bridport Main Road in this area. It is only one component of our important $1 billion record investment in world-class infrastructure across Tasmania to help create new jobs and grow the state's economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last August, I joined my friend and state health minister, Michael Ferguson, in announcing $23 million to improve access to elective surgery in Tasmania for patients who have been waiting longer than clinically recommended waiting times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Work is also about to commence on the $6 million, federally-funded North Bank redevelopment to transform what is currently an unsightly industrial mess into something that is more beautiful and family friendly on the wonderful Tamar River.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I hosted our outstanding environment minister, Greg Hunt, in Launceston, to inspect progress after one year of our $3 million, three-year program for a healthier Tamar River. We are doing that by tackling sediment problems, reducing nutrient run-off, undertaking riverbank stabilisation and improving wastewater management. One of my constituents accompanies me every time I go to look at the Tamar River. She is sitting in the gallery todayâChristine Nikolic, the love of my life, Tasmanian princess, from the kingdom of Riverside. It is wonderful to see her in the gallery. She is someone who grew up in Launceston and has seen the difference that we have made to the Tamar River.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just the other day we were down at Seaport. Last year on 21 June there was the lowest tide of the year. Normally you would find mud at Seaport, an unsightly, stinking mess that puts off tourists. Today, as a result of the investment of this government, there is 3Â½ metres of water above the mud at Seaport. That is something the Tamar River has not seen for a very long time. I am proud that we have partnered with the Launceston Flood Authority. I am proud that Karl Krause, who has come up with a magic way of moving that silt, costing about $1.18 per cubic metre, means we are making a difference to this wonderful river in the centre of our city.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago I opened the $2Â½ million Blue Derby mountain bike trails in Derby in my electorate. The next two Australian championships are going to be held at those trails. This is Olympic standard mountain biking terrain. We anticipate 10,000 to 15,000 by 2017 will be using these mountain bike trails. If you want to see what a difference world-class mountain biking trails can make, look up Fruita in Colorado in the United States, which has transformed that region into the mountain biking capital of the world. I want Derby to have that sort of reputation as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want Northern Tasmania to be much more of an entry point for our state. People, when they think of Tasmania, often think about Hobart, Salamanca and MONA, and Port Arthur. I want them to start thinking about landing in Launceston and thinking of Launceston as a hub, be it for mountain biking adventures, enjoying the best food and drink that you can in Tasmania, or going to play a game of golf at Barnbougle, which is the 11th best golf course in the world. We are looking to give people more reasons to use Northern Tasmania as an entry point for our state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With Mayor Albert van Zetten, a couple of weeks ago I inspected Invermay Park where Ricky Ponting first made his mark as a young cricketer. We are redeveloping Invermay Park to make sure that it is useable for more weeks of the year. We are fixing the drainage problems and putting up some lighting. I think that is going to be magnificent for the multiple users of that facility. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is $900,000 to upgrade Flinders Island Airport. I could go on and on. I have literally another hour's worth of things I could talk to you about, Mr Deputy Speaker. The point I want to make to you is that the investments of the Liberal government are making a real difference in my community, which needs this investment more than any other state. I am pleased to be a member of the Abbott coalition government that is delivering for my state of Tasmania.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  I must pay tribute to the previous speaker. It was one of the better addresses I have heard in this place. He is a man who is conscious of the needs of his electorate and can articulate not only the aspirations for his electorate but also the achievements. The outgoing Liberal government in Queensland told us what they were going to do if they were re-elected. We are not interested in that. We are interested in what you have done. I was in a government and a leader in that government for some 10 years. We were never interested in telling you what we were going to do, because if we were going to do it, we would have already done it. So we told you what we had done. I very much admire the member's contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable member for Leichhardt is in the chamber. He would agree with me that the situation in the outlying first Australian settlements is fairly unfortunate. There is diabetes now in epidemic proportions. Diabetes is another name for malnutrition. You cannot afford to buy fresh fruit and vegetables. You have no work available to you so you do not move around very much. In one council in my electorateâbut I am quite sure it would be the same in the Cape York areaâI asked the entire council whether they had relatives dying of diabetes, and every single member of the council had some close relative dying of diabetes. The situation is far worse in the Torres Strait than there. I think you measure a people based on its poorest people; and, if that is the measure of us as Australians, then we will be judged fairly harshly by history, in spite of the very excellent work done by the member for Leichhardt. There are a lot of people in this place who are very conscious of the environmentâin my opinion, far too conscious. They are preoccupied with trees and animals but they are not particularly interested in the fate of human beings. It amazes me that our First Australians could be left in the situation they are in, and we never hear a word from those sorts of people about that situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I myself find nature and our natural environment very fascinating, and I pay tribute to some of the great naturalists in the Kennedy electorate or, if you like, in North Queensland. Peter Radke and his wife, Ann, are at Yuruga Nursery. He one of the best naturalists in the country and a trained scientistâbut, infinitely more importantly, a self-trained scientist. Steve Malone in Julia Creek is truly one of the people in Australia who best understands our environment and how we interface with it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Steve Malone, Robert Hacon and a number of others have done their best to bring to the attention of this nation an environmental holocaust called the prickly acacia tree, which has wiped out seven million hectares of what were described on the sun map of Queensland some 20 years ago as the best natural grasslands in Australia, as they most certainly were: the Mitchell and Flinders Downs country of Australia. They spawned Qantas and the Labor movement, although some people may not regard that as a necessarily good thing these days. <span style="font-style:italic;">Waltzing Matilda</span> was written there. The Royal Flying Doctor Service was established there. Seven million hectares of that beautiful, natural pasture has been wiped out. The Julia Creek dunnart, the most threatened species in Australia outside of Australian farmers, is under very real threat from the approaching prickly acacia. So, what you do about it? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The way it happens is really pretty simple. Weeds get washed away in flood times. When the floodwaters break the banks of the river, they stretch out and provide a wonderfully moist environment upon which, in our dry land, at the end of the dry season, there is no ground cover. So there is no competition really for these plants, and they run away on the riverbanks. But that would not happen if the riverbanks were lined with irrigated pasture, and in North Queensland there is no excuse for us not doing that except for the restraints, constraints and impositions of government. If every single landholder were allowed to irrigate up to a maximum of 300 hectares, then we would not have drought in North Queensland, because almost every single station property has access to a critical river that runs every year. I have mentioned many times in this place that my own family has lived on or near the banks of the Cloncurry River for 120 years and it has run every single year in those 120 years, and yet it is 500 kilometres from the sea. We do not have a shortage of water. We have a shortage of water for 90 per cent of the year and a very destructive abundance, a superabundance, of water for the other two or three months of the year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you built a little weir or a small dam, or if you just permitted the people to have up to 300 hectares of irrigation landâa landholder might own five acres; well, give him five acres of irrigation land, just let him do thatâit would go a long way toward solving the problem. Far be it from me to propose the building of dams; but, in our country of Australia, to my knowledge, in the last 30 years there has not been a single irrigation dam built. Here is the driest continent on earth going through one of the worst drought periods in its history, and there has not been a single damn built, not a single weir built, anywhere in the country. But we have people parading around North Queensland talking about the Northern Australia task force. I am not denigrating the honourable member for Leichhardt; I think he does everything that he can do. But please do not come around telling us what you are going to do; either do it or shut up. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want a lesson from Queensland, people in other states, look at the government in Queensland that had 72 seats and had left their opponents with seven seats in the parliamentâ72 to sevenâand how they lost the next election. Just wander around telling us what you are going to do and then go and sack public servants, hell west and crooked, and tell us you are broke; and then decide to build a $5,000 million tunnel in the middle of Brisbane and then tell us you are broke. As Robbie Katter, the state member for Mount Isa, said: 'You say you have no money but you've decided to allocate $5,000 million, one-tenth of the budget of Queensland, to building yet another tunnel, which makes Brisbane the most tunnelled city in the world per head of population.' It is almost double its nearest rival, which I think is Tokyo. But, as he said, what do you get for your $5,000 million? A few thousand people get home a bit earlier to watch television. That is a wonderful achievement for $5,000 million! Now, if that $5,000 million had been used in the north to build a dam west of Townsville, it would have irrigated 120,000 hectares of land foreverâforever. There is no lack of water in the river; the Burdekin River is the third biggest river in Australia. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We could produce ethanol instead of putting CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> up in the atmosphere. Yes, ethanol will put it up but it will pull it back down again so there is no growth. Of course, I am no fan of <span style="font-style:italic;">An Inconvenient Truth</span>, the film by former US Vice-President Al Gore. All the same, his first solution to CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;"></span>problems is ethanol. Every country on earth has moved to ethanolâevery single country on earth. China, India, Japan, half of Indonesia, all of North America, all of South America and every single European country have signed up to 15 per cent ethanol.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This country has no petrol. It is one of the few countries on earth that has absolutely no solutions to its petrol problem. It was self-sufficient. In 2002 we sent $1 billion overseas. Now we are sending $25 billion a year to the Middle East to buy petrol, because we have no petrol. If you want to have a look at the cause of the Second World War, it was pretty simple: America cut off petrol to Japan. What was the war in Europe about? It was a drive to the oilfields. The great battle of the Second World War was Stalingrad, and that was all about oil. In my first year out of school I was handed a rifle. I had to give two telephone numbers and I was on my way to fight Indonesiaâwe were at war with Indonesia. What was the war about? It was about petrol. The Indonesians had seized the oilfields. That is what it was about.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cut off the Indonesian's food supply. If you fight a war about cutting off somebody's petrol supply, how angry are you going to get when people cut off your food supply? The Indonesians have a very limited access to protein. The national dish is rendang.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I live in a country that within two years will have no manufacturing base. When the motor vehicle industry closes down it will take down 72 per cent of Australia's manufacturing. What is left? The last whitegoods factory closed in Orange last year or it closes early this year. There are 20,000 jobs that will vanish in the coal seam gas industry in Queensland when it finishes its development phase this year. There are 15,000 jobs to go in the coal industry. There are 3,000 in the sugar industry. The steel industry has said that there has to be a reserve resource policy, which this government has no intention of doing. Nor does the ALP have any intention of introducing a reserve resource policy, which every other country on earth has got. I am very familiar with it, because we had one in Queensland. That is how we were able to get the aluminium industry. We had the cheapest electricity in the world. Now that we have the second most expensive electricity in the world what do you think is going to happen to the aluminium industry. I think that we can say goodbye to the aluminium industry and most mineral processing, because we now have the second-highest electricity charges in the world. That is another marvellous success story of marketism, of the free market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland and in the rest of Australia we had an average household paying $640 a year for electricity for 10 years. At the start of the 10 years, in 1990, it was $640. At the end of that 10 years it was still $640. There was no movement in price. Then the incoming ALP government, along with their federal colleagues with their great leader Mr Keating, decided to deregulate the industry and semi-privatise it. It was a marvellous success story! We went from $640 a year, which it had been for 10 years, straight up to $2,400, and it is not stopping there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The steel industry has said that if there is no reserve resource policy on gas it cannot survive, so that is 50,000 jobs there. The aluminium industry has no hope of survival rate where it is at present. It is just congealed electricity, and electricity charges are the second-highest in the world, so add 25,000 jobs to that. The fertiliser industry has gone. The food-processing industry has gone. But this we know: 55,000 jobs in the motor vehicle industry have vanished; 15,000, arguably 20,000, in the coal seam gas industry; 15,000 in the coal industry; and 3,000 in the sugar industry. That, we absolutely know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the federal government thinks that it is going to survive the loss of some 200,000 to 300,000 direct jobs in this country over the next two years it believes in the tooth fairy. If it thinks it is safe then it should look at Queensland. Extrapolate the figures from the Queensland election to the federal figures and then tell me whether it is going to be governing this country at the end of next year. I very much doubt that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All we are asking is that they build the Galilee rail line. Do not wait for some foreign corporation to build it. Build the Galilee rail line. Every single millimetre of the 3Â½ thousand kilometres of rail line in Queensland into their coalfields was built by the government. I might add, it was built by my government. I was a party to it. I say that very proudly. Introduce ethanol, for heaven's sake instead of sending $25,000 billion overseas every year. Pull the brakes of the from farming industry and we will have $10 billion a year in prawn farming, the same as Thailand has with much less suitable coastline than we have. It was the Liberal government that destroyed the prawn-farming industry in Australia. It went from $600 million down to about $35 million. If you unleash the irrigation potential of the north, even in a very minor way, say, 100 million a year, you will take the cattle industry to 10,000 million a year in North Queensland alone. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="241586" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs SUDMALIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2014-2015 and cognate bills. I am taking this opportunity to talk about issues that range from bridges to berries. Some would say that is a strange theme, but I assure members that it does make sense. The last 16 months have been extraordinary for a first time member of parliament. Initially, the thought of working with all sides of parliament for the overall better positioning of Australia was inspiring. It was not long before I realised that there is a great deal of point-scoring and a lot of rhetoric from those who wish to be in government and are in a constant state of debt denial. It is unbelievable to see them in action, posturing and complaining about so-called cuts in expenditure. We have made changes to stop spending imaginary dollars from the previous government's imaginary surplus which they were never going to achieve</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Gilmore get it. They know there is a problem with national debt. They know we have to work hard to get rid of the billion dollar a month interest payments. And, finally, they know that I am working hard to get as much as possible allocated to Gilmore to improve job prospects and community amenity and keep the national debt contained. The people of Gilmore know the process is slow and steady, with gradual improvements over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us start with the idea of bridges. There is really only one bridge that is of great importance to the residents of Gilmore, the third river crossing at Nowra. The NSW government dedicated $1.6 million towards the project. This money was to determine the best location for the new bridge after tests and extensive community consultation. The next $10 million was my election commitment, and I can say that this money has been delivered to Roads and Maritime Services for the design, engineering, structural planning and roads integration, with possible land acquisition and environmental studies. This is a necessary stage of the process and only after this is complete will we have an accurate estimate of construction costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been meeting with advisers and the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development on a regular basis to continue lobbying for this project. The bridge is so important and I will continually be reminding the minister of the need for this infrastructure. The residents of Gilmore, the businesses of the South Coast and the thousands of visitors to the area know how important this bridge is for economic growth, urban growth, tourism and local convenience. I will proudly continue to lobby to fulfil this project. I will work with my state colleagues to garner as much funding as possible for the Princes Highway, through joint projects. That includes the recently announced $2.95 million from the federal government, in conjunction with $3.1 million from the New South Wales state Liberal government and $300,000 from the Shoalhaven City Council for the Flinders Road and Princes Highway interchange and an upgrade for the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Programme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We committed to an additional $5 million dollars for roadworks in Gilmore to improve safety and fix roads that assist our residents. Part of this allocation was for a section of Turpentine Road to be completed. Since then, an additional $824,000 has been allocated from the federal Black Spot Programme funding. The council has now added funds so the whole of Turpentine Road will be sealed. This is a tremendous outcome for our region; not to mention, there is also the almost $2.5 million for further road black spots in Gilmore. Add this to the Roads to Recovery funding and there is almost another $6.5 million for roads in the three council areas: Shoalhaven, Kiama and Shellharbour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might wonder why I am so passionate about roads in Gilmore. It is an electorate of almost 5,000 square kilometres. I travel from north to south visiting the different villages. You guessed it: I drive almost 50,000 kilometres each year. Of course, apart from my own use of the roads, our whole community depends on road transport for its very survival. Residents of Gilmore have to drive for appointments, for shopping, to get the children to school and to get to the beach. The distances are not just a couple of blocks; sometimes, it is around 10 kilometres to the nearest shopping centre and it is just not the general store.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More importantly, the hidden small manufacturers and small businesses depend on the roads to get their materials to their place of production and get their finished product to the transit hubs. You have often heard me speak of the time in my life when I was a fudge manufacturer. Once a month for almost 17 years, I would drive from Kiama to Moruya and sometimes to Bega to deliver hundreds of kilos of fudge. Even for a business as unlikely as a fudge manufacturer on the South Coast, the importance of our local roads is hugely significant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Road infrastructure is critical to our regional businesses, for every delay is a lost opportunity. I well remember the time in the early 90s when the Princes Highway was cut by floodwaters. The large freight trucks could not pass through, so my family would load up our delivery van and use an alternate route to get our one tonne weekly delivery of fudge to Queensland. In our later years of operation, we were sending pallet loads and sending 20 to 30 tonnes a day. However, I digress. This is purely to show why I am passionate about improving roads in Gilmore; the roads are our economic and tourist arteries. They cannot, under any circumstances, be traffic blocks for economic growth and opportunity for industry and tourism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to the new proposed alignment of the bridge. The decision has been made for it to be on the western side of the existing bridges. I admit, I was a bit surprised by this decision; but when I looked at the aerial photos, the alignment was completely logical. Talking about aerial shots, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span> is the base of helicopter excellence. In October last year, the $700 million dollar helicopter aircrew training systemâHATSâwas confirmed and it is to be invested in our base. I cannot describe how proud I was to be present for the signing of that agreement. In fact, every time I visit HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span> and HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Creswell</span> I feel a great sense of community pride. Perhaps it could be because I recently found out that my great-great-grandfather joined the Navy in 1916.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I do not believe that is just why. The local TS Shoalhaven cadets, the helicopter pilots, the entire workforce on the bases, captains and Commodore Vince Di Pietro are such great examples of our uniformed and non-uniformed community leaders working in the Defence industry. I am just completely proud of them all, as well as being convinced that the investment by my government is well-placed and well-deserved. This is not the only investment that has been made on our base. We have the Romeo helicopter program and it is absolutely brilliant. This is a further investment of just over $3 billion dollars. The funding will allow the Navy to acquire a total of 24 Romeo helicopters. Each and every one of them is to be based at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span>. The first one arrived just a few months ago. We are so thrilled. Defence is already one of the Shoalhaven's largest employers, with over 2,000 local residents employed by Defence or a Defence-associated industry. With all of this local investment, it is clear that Defence is very pleased to call our region home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to speak for a moment about the significance grants for the Anzac Centenary. Gilmore has 12 really special projects that were funded. I would like to thank committee members Bob O'Grady, Barry Young, Kim Kearney, Allan Hurrell, Fred Dawson, Stanley Berriman, Don Handley, Barry Edwards and especially Rick Meehan and Clyde Poulton for their extensive work behind the scenes, with timely advice and the preparation of the submissions. It is outstanding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The grants have been allocated to villages that reflect the diversity of Gilmore. Warilla RSL Sub-Branch have an adopt-a-digger program for local schools, as well as funds for a great service recognising World War I at the Shellharbour Village War Memorial. Shell Cove Public School will be installing a commemorative plaque on a large rock structure in their school grounds. Kiama Municipal Council has some extra funds to go towards the restoration and stabilisation of their leaning memorial arch. Gerringong RSL Sub-Branch will be installing a new flagpole and plaque in Gerringong's park at the site of the lone pine tree, which was planted some years ago in addition to starting a new dawn service. I commend the tireless efforts of Bill Popple and Garry Hingle on this project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Shoalhaven Anzac Centenary Committee will also be holding a very special commemorative dinner. Clyde Poulton of the Vietnam Veterans, Peacekeepers and Peacemakers Association will also be coordinating a re-enactment of the Waratah marchâincluding a steam trainâfrom Nowra to Sydney, working with local schools, veterans and businesses. Nowra RSL Sub-Branch will also be publishing a centenary edition of that same march. Shoalhaven City Council should also be congratulated, along with the work of Margaret Simoes and Tania Morandini. They have developed an exhibition entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memory</span>, honouring the Aboriginal servicemen and servicewomen of the South Coast. Huskisson RSL sub-Branch will be constructing a remembrance court in Voyager Memorial Park to honour the service men and women lost in World War I. Sussex Inlet RSL sub-Branch will be rejuvenating their World War I memorial to place a lasting legacy for the tight knit community. Milton-Ulladulla RSL sub-Branch are also building an ANZAC memorial to commemorate the centenary of Gallipoli, and, last but not leastâbecause this one was a good oneâat Ulladulla High School the history teacher is harmonising the energy of students, the local show society, the men's shed, and the Lake Tabourie Museum to set up a new display space that will change each year to commemorate the four years of World War I. We are also hoping to have a poppy colouring-in competition for our primary schools, a short story or poem contribution, and a red poppy drive so the whole region is covered in poppies. It is an impressive range of local endeavour, with talents and ideas being unlocked by the local distribution of almost $125,000 in centenary commemorative grants from our government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have taken this opportunity to cover a vast range of achievements and projects that have been delivered by the coalition government. This is only the beginning, and we have many challenges to meet. There are still problems that need community feedback and prioritisation. There are national issues that need resolutions and pathways to move this country forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have employment issues. As I spoke of earlier last week, I am greatly saddened by the closure of our iconic paper mill in the Shoalhaven. Gilmore really does not need another increase in local unemployment, and the affected families will have a huge task adjusting to such a change. It will be very difficult. I have organised a number of avenues to help, but the preferred action, of course, would have been to keep the mill in production. The owners have had to make a very difficult decision. Over the past few days, I have also met with the Minister for Industry, the Hon. Ian Macfarlane, the Minister for Social Services, Senator the Hon. Marise Payne, as well as our Prime Minister, the Hon. Tony Abbott, to discuss further opportunities for the government in any avenue that we can help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I began this presentation with the concept of bridges and berries, and I chose this theme because the issues I have put forward have direct relevance to everyone living in Gilmore. We actually do have some small-scale berry producers in the region, but they only sell fresh berries, not frozen ones. And that is one of the issues that is being discussed by many families in Gilmore, and, in fact, in many regions across Australia. The concern about hygienic food, labelling and Australian production will be a pond-rippling issue for quite some time. Local Gilmore families want to support Australian growers and suppliers, but the current labelling requirements actually make it fairly difficult.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I attended a briefing on this. Labelling has been an issue of national significanceâwould you believeâsince 2002. There have been inquiries and recommendations through all different levels and colours of government, yet there has not been a universally accepted or applied change for our labelling requirements. It crosses several portfolios, so that is part of the complications. Once again, my experiences in fudge manufacturing give me some insight into packaging and labelling. It can be done, and it does not have to be expensive. Australians want Australian made products, but there is so much confusion over the terminology that buyers have really no idea what they are buying. Often a business will use a twist of phrase to encourage the buyer to think that something is Australian, and yet, some industries believe that 90 per cent content requirement is too high a bar to set as the benchmark, and that a 50 per cent  transformationâsomething like a product being crumbed and packed in Australiaâallows it to have the label 'Made in Australia'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is even support for the view that if 50 percent of the cost of the product is packed here, then it can have 'Made in Australia'. I mean, seriously, this really is an inappropriate application. There really does need to be an overhaul. We need to be consistent. It needs to be readable and understandable to help our mums and dads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current concern about frozen berries is actually not a new industry issue. There have been similar issues arising from imported products in the past. The berry issue actually brings to light the need for a packaging review to ultimately help our mums and dads buy products for their families. There are multilayer portfolio responsibilities for labelling, and the Minister for Industry, Ian Macfarlane, is determined to draw together this expertise as well as garner information from the community to help resolve this very important issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is actually time we built the bridges between manufacturers, growers and consumers, whether it be for berries or any other Australian product. So, the theme of bridges to berries is not really that bizarre. It is the task of a community leader to draw together opinions and views and to advocate for community expectation and community need. That is our job. That is why we are here, and that is what we are supposed to be doing: getting on with the job of doing the things we need to do for our community. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  I know the member for Gilmore is a very community minded member of parliament, but unfortunately I do not see a major achievement of government as conducting a cooking competition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather, I must say, members of the electorate that I represent are coming to me in a very distressed situation. They are distressed because they are worried about health care. They are worried about the education of their children and grandchildren, and they are worried about the impact that this harsh governmentâthis Abbott coalition governmentâis having on them, on their lives and on all people in their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding the point that the member for Gilmore made about packaging, I think knowing what you are eating and having it clearly marked on the package is important, but the other thing that is really important is that the quality and the purity of the food is known and that a consumer can really be confident the food they are about to eat is not contaminated. That is an issue that has been raised with me in my electorate, and I encourage the government to look past the labelling to actually looking at ensuring that the food that is packaged is safe and that consumers can eat it with confidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These budget papers demonstrate that the Abbott government is unable to govern for all Australians. We see time and time again in this House that the government is pushing small sectional interests. We all know that those on the other side of the House made a move towards good government a couple of weeks ago, but we are still trying to find evidence of that good government. When people phone my office and when I meet people in the community, their comments about this age of new government are anything but flattering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills do absolutely nothing to address the unfairness of the May budget, an issue that has been raised with me time and time again. Constituents ask me to stop measures that this government has tried to introduce. But the bottom line is that the government has the numbers in this House. Unfortunately, those opposite are arrogantly ignoring the people in their electorates. If they were listening to what their constituents were saying, I am sure they would be hearing exactly what I am hearing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is really not in tune with what Australian people want. And these papers contain no new ideas whatsoever. It is more of the same old diatribe, more of the same tired ideas that we have seen from this government since it was elected. It is pushing an ideological agenda. With respect to workplace relations, it already has credentials on the books, with its commitment to Work Choices in a previous parliament. Then there is its attack on Medicare. We on this side of the House appreciate that the Prime Minister has very little respect for Medicare. As health minister, he used to stand up in this parliament with a smirk on his faceâI emphasise 'a smirk'âsaying that he was the best friend that Medicare ever had. We have seen him demonstrate just what sort of a friend he is. I would certainly hate to be his enemy. We have probably seen a bit of an example of what it means to be his enemy in the way that he has treated people in this parliament and in his attacks on Gillian Triggs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government talks about Medicare. There have been many, many attempts to ram through this House its unfair GP tax. It has not introduced the legislation into this parliament, because it knows it will not get through. It tried to do it by the back door, through regulation that was supposed take effect on 19 January. But the government pulled the plug at the last minute, because not only the people that I represent and the people that each and every member of the other side of the parliament represents but the doctors themselves were up in arms about this government's assault on Medicare, this government's assault on the good health of all Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The plan that this government has for Medicare is diabolical. It means that if you have a chronic illness you will have to pay a lot of money to go and see a doctor. On an ongoing basis you are going to be hit with surcharges. If you are a pensioner or a senior and you are lucky enough to find a doctor who will bulk-bill you, you should be okay. But it is a two-tier system that is designed to end Medicare as we know it. It is a system that is about watering down Medicare. It shows the ideological hatred that those on the other side of this House have towards universal health care, because that is what it isâan attack on universal health care. And it is the Australian people who will pay for this attack.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we come to the $100,000 university degrees. I was fortunate enough to go to the University of Newcastle during orientation week. I had a petition with me that students could sign, stating their objection to the changes that this government had in the pipeline for universities. </span>

                    </a>  The member for Lindsay may support these changes, but I can assure her that the university students at the University of Newcastle were lining up to sign the petition. We had three people working on that stall, and university students were constantly signing the petition, because they did not want legislation introduced into this House that led to a 20 per cent cut in funding to universities, they did not want legislation that deregulated fees to allow universities to charge basically whatever they want to, and they particularly did not want savage cuts to regional universities like the University of Newcastle. These changes will have an impact on mature age students and a great impact on people from lower paid background. </span>

                    </a>  The member for Lindsay continually rabbits on while I am speaking, but no matter what she says it will not change the fact that this is unfair, that this is going to undermine our university system. There is a real prospect of $100,000 degrees. But those on the other side of this House really are not too concerned about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have talked a lot about the unfairness of the May budget. I think this is borne out by the fact that the gap between the rich and poor in Australia is growing bigger and bigger, with 12.8 per cent of all Australians living below the poverty line. That is after taking into account their housing costs. As well, 17.3 per cent of children are living below the poverty line. Many, many families are living lives of stress and deprivation due to poverty. Those on the other side of the House are keen to implement more policies and changes that will make this situation even worse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time that we have growing poverty, we see that the richest 10 per cent of Australians had almost 50 per cent of the growth in income over the past three decades. Income inequality has continued to grow and it is getting worse. At this rate, we will soon have an American-style split between the working poor and the super rich. This growing inequality of income is made much worse by the increasing cost of housing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How do this government address this inequality? They address it by cutting funds to services that provide support for those people who are really struggling to make ends meet. They have cut community grants, they have cut funding for homelessness service providers and they have cut money to groups that provide emergency services. This is the Liberal way. This is the way that those on the other side of this parliament believe things should be. They are quite happy with the burgeoning inequality in society, and they are quite happy for the wealthiest Australians to become even wealthier. At the same time, they are happy to cut funding to community organisations and a large number of charities who provide welfare services across Australia. We on this side of the House believe that that is totally unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area is unemployment. Unemployment has increased, and what is the government's response to that? Its response is to make young people under 30 wait six months before they can get any sort of income support. Once again, it is throwing people into poverty and not understanding the real issue. The real issue is not that people are unemployed, because they choose to be. The real issue is not that if you are under 30 then you must go for six months without receiving any income support or that it is your problem and not the government's. The real issue is that jobs are disappearing under this government. The real issue is that this government has a one-sided approach to addressing unemployment, and that is to punish those people who lose their jobs and those people who are unemployed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is once again driven by the government's ideology of attacking those people in the community who are least able to look after themselves. It is driven by their ideology of attacking the sick, the poor and working families; cutting pensions and attacking seniors; and ripping funds, as I have mentioned, from groups that support those people who look to government to support them. This government has no new ideas, just this harsh ideological approach to governing Australia. This harsh approach has no idea whatsoever; it is directed towards inflicting the greatest amount of hurt upon people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might ask: what is the Labor Party's approach to this? It is very, very different indeed. We do not think that you attack those people that can least afford it. We believe that some of those multinational companies out there should contribute a lot more towards the welfare and the budget in Australia. We have a plan that will bring in $1.9 billion in revenue, as opposed to the Abbott government's attack on families, the sick, the poor and the seniors in our country. At the same time, our plan will provide $45 million more than the combination of this government's attacks on Australians. It is not broken promises and it is not the lack of vision; it is the hurt that this government is causing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why should a company such as James Hardie have a tax advantage over other Australians? We believe that loopholes should be closed so that large multinational companies stop sending profits overseas and avoid paying their taxes. That is fair. That is ensuring that the big companies and multinational companies contribute to our country. That is what Australians want. They want to see that it is not just ordinary, average Australians that become the lifters. We want to see some of those supporters of the government do a little bit of heavy lifting. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find these budget papers extremely disappointing and I urge members to go back to their electorates and talk to theirâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In doing so, I would like to share with the House some of the very positive economic activity taking place in the outer suburbs of Western Sydney. So much work has been done with regard to the innovation corridorâa corridor of smart jobs that will not only create new and emerging industries but will also create the jobs, and the smart jobs, of tomorrow.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As it stands today, Western Sydney suffers with job deficits of anywhere between 180,000 and 220,000 jobs. The Penrith Business Alliance further estimates that two-thirds of the region are forced to commute every single day to workâthat is about 65,000 people. Most of these people make the trip by car along the M4 to their place of employment. This daily commute, this exodus from the region, can take anywhere between two to four hours a day. Let us think of the damage to our local economy done by this leakage of people leaving our town every single day and the disruption to all of those families, not to mention the immense effect that it has on our nation's productivity. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be part of a government that has a vision for Western Sydney, that has a vision for our nation and one that is getting on with the job of delivering that vision. In January, I was very honoured to host the Treasurer. First, I took him to a suburb called Jordan Springsâone of seven new housing developments going up within my electorate at this point in time </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This development was awarded the prestigious 2014 best master-planned development in NSW by the Urban Development Institute of Australia. It is developments like Jordan Springs that have driven economic growth in New South Wales from last in our country to the state performing best in our country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Later I took the Treasurer to meet local business innovators and they discussed with him the amazing opportunities they saw for Western Sydney. One particular opportunity is that of the Sydney Science Parkâa 287 hectare mixed use development in Luddenham. As its vision statement clearly says, Sydney Science Park will be a new centre of excellence in the key growth areas of food security, energy and health. This internationally recognised epicentre for research and development will employ 12,200 professionals, educate 10,000 students and provide quality residences and infrastructure to cater for them. Spread across 287 hectares in the growing Western Sydney region, Sydney Science Park will be home to the Baiada laboratories, the research and development arm of one of Australia's largest privately owned food groups. By bringing together the industry's best and brightest, this multibillion dollar precinct will help drive growth, productivity and competitiveness across the food and agribusiness sector.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This development will bring together thousands of jobs and scientific minds to study some of our agricultural industries. Over and above the value of the land, the Baiada group are pledging to invest in the vicinity of $2.5 billion into our region. This private investment further complements the $3.6 billion investment the federal government, together with the New South Wales Baird government, is investing in the roads of the 21st century. These roads will improve the vital arteries that connect our regions. In my electorate of Lindsay, this will include the widening of Northern Road and Elizabeth Drive, and there will be improvements to Bringelly Road in the electorate of Macarthur.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is very exciting news for the people of Western Sydney. I am proud to be part of a government that is delivering for the people I represent. In February I was honoured to host the foreign minister. We oversaw the beginning of the development of the Sydney IQ medical research park in Werrington, a location where already $28million has been made available by the federal government and the University of Western Sydney. This soon to be Sydney IQ business park will be home to 450 new jobs. Thanks to the work of the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, the member for Mayo, the coalition government has further provided a consignment loan of $70 million to the New South Wales state government to immediately commence works on the Werrington Arterialâa vital piece of infrastructure that will provide a link to Sydney IQ, ultimately delivering 6,000 jobs to this region in medical research and technology. How can you not be excited by this? I have already mentioned 12,000 jobs, and now there are another 6,000 jobsâdirectly out of the policies of this government. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Foreign Affairs in opposition worked hard on the free trade agreements that were ultimately delivered by the current Minister for Trade and Investment. These free trade agreements have had a massive impact; we are seeing the first fruits of these labours growing and coming to life in the electorate. Later in the month I will be honoured to have the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is in the chamber tonight, come and visit the electorate of Lindsay. He will meet a delegation of Chinese businessmen who are coming to Lindsay to see how they can further be part of this emerging services industry so these services can then be provided back to China. This is exciting news for Western Sydney, this is exciting news for Australians, and it is exciting to see so many members of our executive getting on board and working hard to deliver smart jobs for tomorrow. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the free trade agreement the University of Western Sydney have signed a memorandum of understanding with the Beijing University of Medical Research whereby the University of Western Sydney will be working to accredit and do all of the research trials on Chinese medicines. Globally, this is a $170 billion industry. This is where Western Sydney can really carve a niche for itself. An initial injection of $20 million from the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine will establish a world-leading centre in traditional medicines and will provide the catalyst to get the accreditation facility up and running. Penrith council reports a staggering average of $100 million in development proposals coming across its desk every month as people see the potential in investing in this thriving region. At the other end of it, we also have to look at the commitments from this government to ensure that we make this all possible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only a few weeks ago I was honoured to host the Prime Minister in the electorate of Lindsay. We went out to Castlereagh, where we met with hundreds of local people who were wanting to meet and shake the hand of the Australian Prime Minister. We looked from Castlereagh across the Penrith Lakes scheme, a 200 hectare site that was once the Castlereagh quarries that provided in the vicinity of 70 to 80 per cent of all the sand for Sydney developments over the last 50 years. This land reeks of opportunity. Within the next six to 18 months this land will be handed back to the New South Wales state government and together with the state department of planning and the state department of sport and the Penrith council we are now developing a plan that will develop this crucial region.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think I have clearly demonstrated how this government is focused on the people of Western Sydney and is clearly focused on delivering growth, jobs and opportunity for all Australians. But the work does not stop there. Let us discuss WestConnex, Australia's largest urban road projectâone that will ease congestion by allowing those travelling east from Penrith into the city to bypass 52 sets of traffic lights. It will provide 10,000 jobs to the people of inner Western Sydney. But it does not stop with WestConnex. What about NorthConnex? How many people in the region dread Pennant Hills Roadâthe pain of Pennant Hills Roadâparticularly as people travel up into the Central Coast for their summer holidays? NorthConnex will allow a bypass of Pennant Hills Road. I am sure that the member for Parramatta, who is also here tonight, would also like to see a bypass of Pennant Hills Road; it would also very much benefit the community in Parramatta. These are projects of visionâprojects that will get the outer Western Sydney suburbs moving. The coalition government is working together at both state and federal levels. No longer will the people of Western Sydney be taken for granted, and no longer will they be left behind. I believe we have the opportunity to lead the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With all this development, I am also acutely aware of the spectacular and beautiful bushland that we in Western Sydney are custodians of; in particular, the Cumberland Plain Woodland, a critically endangered habitat. With so much development, we must carefully manage the competing priorities in order to care for this bushland. I would also like to applaud the efforts and the work of the Minister for Environment, not only for his long and consistent support but also, more to the point, his belief in protecting our native bushland. I would also like to record the work of so many local conservationists, including Wayne Olling, Lisa Harrold, and Geoff Brown; and Indigenous groups like Muru Mittigar, Kevin Kavanagh, and the Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Councilâall working together to protect our bushland and to preserve our Indigenous heritage. Working with all of these local environmental stakeholders, the Minister for Environment is delivering 10 Green Army projects over the next four years. Together with land acquisitions, these projects are designed to build the connectivity of the Cumberland Conservation Corridor, a strategic arc of a natural corridor that will link flora and fauna, so that we can preserve what is so special and unique about our region. This is a vitally important project. Some of the areas earmarked still have platypus populations, while a number of creek lines are recognised as extremely rare examples of pristine environments which link back to pre-colonisation and into our Indigenous heritage. There is still so much work to be done in this space. I call on the state government to ensure that all biodiversity credits createdâfrom all of the development right across Western Sydneyâstay in Western Sydney. My own opinion is that I would love to see those credits invested into the Cumberland Conservation Corridor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased to confirm that there will be 10 Green Army projects in Lindsayâanother excellent government initiative for which the minister for environment and heritage must be congratulated. There are only 350 projects awarded around the country, so receiving 10 within Lindsay is an amazing achievement. Almost all of them will be focused on restoring, where possible, the integrity of the remnant of the Cumberland Plain bushland. Some of the work will be carried out in conjunction with other groups in the area, like the Indigenous enterprise group Muru Mittigar, a well-respected cultural Indigenous centre for the local region. They will run nurseries, including the propagation of plants as well as seedlings, and they will roll out the projects. But here is the best news: Muru Mittigar say that at the end of the project they are aiming for a 90-per-cent employment rate for all the participants of their Green Army projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Sydney has one of the largest Aboriginal populations in the country andâas we have spoken about with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Close</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he </span><span style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ap</span> report just a few weeks agoâproviding Aboriginal employment is absolutely crucial. Working with the Green Army on this sort of projectâa project that will deliver a 90-per-cent employment rate at the end of the projectâis a noble cause for Muru Mittigar, and I applaud Peter Chia and the team at Muru for what they are doing. We are not only investing in keeping the green lungs of Western Sydney healthy; this is also a program of investing in jobs. And Muru Mittigar has the runs on the board to secure such a remarkable outcome. Since they began, Muru Mittigar has placed over 1,000 local Indigenous Australians into ongoing work and full-time work. That is an impressive record by anyone's standards. My interest in doing my bit for the economy isâalong with the plan outlined by the Penrith Business Allianceâto create a further 40,000 jobs in Lindsay over the coming two decades.</span>

It is a detailed vision for what our forefathers thought was possible for our region. For 30 or 40 years, the vision pretty much stayed idle. But today, with this coalition government, we are seeing a vision and a life come to fruition. I would like to congratulate and thank my community and this government for delivering for the people of Western Sydney. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:27</span>):  These bills, the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2014-2015 and related bills, expose the Abbott government's mismanagement of the Australian economy, its poor financial management, and the disastrous effects that its misguided policies are having on the budget's bottom line. The Abbott government's financial strategy is indeed in tatters, its budget is a mess, and its attempts to blame Labor for that mess are wearing thin. The Abbott government has now been in office for nearly 18 months It is halfway through its first term, and it is ready to bring down its second budgetâit still has not got its last budget through the parliament, and it still does not wish to claim any responsibility whatsoever for the nation's deteriorating financial position. How long can a government continue to remain in office and claim no responsibility for the state of its budget? Can I suggest to members opposite that, whilst they are continuing with that spin, it is not being accepted by people out there in the community who, after this government handed down its budget nearly a year ago, said: 'It is now up to the government of the day to take responsibility for the nation' economy.' And yet the government will not do that. It is clear that this government has lost control of its budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to a media report released in the last couple of hours by Peter Martin and Gareth Hutchens, the government has spent $380,000 on focus groups to test reactions to this week's Intergenerational Report. The government has money to spend on focus groups but then cuts every last penny from community groups around this country and justifies that by saying that we have budget crisis, a budget disaster, intergenerational theft and other constant spin lines that I hear each and every day in this chamber from the Treasurer and members of the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Abbott government was elected the independent, Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook projected a $24 billion deficit in 2014-15. I understand that deficit has now blown out by $16.4 billion, again according to the Abbott government's Mid-year Economic and Fiscal Outlookâthat is after taking into account all the cuts this government has implemented in the meantime. I further understand that, according to the government's own forward estimates, the deficit will blow out by $44 billion. It is the government's own policies that have brought the budget to this very positionâpolicies that have caused a loss of confidence throughout the country and in turn a fall in government tax revenue and an increase in government expenditure. Tax revenue falls when businesses do not invest, when businesses close, when more people are unemployed or working fewer hours or are only working part-time. Conversely, welfare costs increase when more people are unemployed. Business confidence also falls when businesses see savage cuts to government departments and a government in disarray, as we see each and every day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that simply denies the obvious and continues to perpetuate the spin that it was elected withâthat is, the scare campaign that it ran about debt and deficit at the last election. That scare campaign has now caused the government to box itself into a corner through its own dishonesty. It is a government that thinks that every difficult situation can be fixed by cutting government funding or washing its hands of government responsibility. This is the flawed ideology of the extreme right-wing ideologues who have taken control of the Abbott government. This is a government that foolishly believes that austerity measures work, and it is too blind to see the damage already being done by the Abbott government's cuts after 18 months in office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills appropriate an additional $1.7 billion to pay for the policies, election promises and blunders of the Abbott government. It is $1.7 billion of additional debt that arises solely from Abbott government decisions and expenditure incurred on the Abbott government's watch. It is $1.7 billion of expenditure after taking into account savage cuts to the ABC, to family payments, $11.3 billion of cuts to foreign aidâto mention just a few areas. Whilst the Abbott government adds $1.7 billion to government expenditure, it simultaneously squeezes more money out of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society under the guise that it has inherited a budget crisis. I spoke only today of $270 million that has been cut from some of the most valuable community organisations that provide essential front line services across this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the government tells one story to votersâpainting a picture of a country burdened with debt and need for austerity measuresâit tells a different story to the rest of the world in its Australian Trade Commission report, where the real state of the Australian economy is revealed. Amongst the findings, the Trade Commission report states that over the past 23 years, Australia's economy has achieved real GDP average growth of 3.3 per cent per annum and Australia is the only developed country to have recorded no annual recession over this 23-year period. Australia's forecast economic growth rate between 2015 and 2019 is the highest amongst the major advanced economies. At $1.5 trillion Australia's economy is forecast to be the 13th largest in the world in 2015. Even during the global financial crisis years, the Australian economy continued to grow at a rate of 2.7 per centâhigher than many other developed countriesâthough members opposite continually forget that the last Labor government presided over the global financial crisis and managed it well. That is exactly why it grew by 2.7 per cent throughout those years. Were it not for the policies of the previous Labor government we would not have the statistics that I have just mentionedâstatistics which the government likes to use when they are talking to people in other countries about the strength of the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at key economic indices, notably productivity levels of 16 out of 20 Australian industries rated above the average productivity of global competitors in the same sector. In particular, there was strong productivity growth of 1.9 per cent in 2012-13 and 2.6 per cent in 2013-14. Over the last 23 years of consecutive growth, labour productivity has recorded a compound growth rate of 1.8 per cent, while real unit labour costs have fallen by 0.5 per cent each year. In other words, in all of those years, productivity in this country continued to grow. Those statistics completely contradict the Abbott government's spin about the need to improve productivity by cutting back on workers' wages, conditions and entitlements. We see that time and time again in this chamber: members opposite come in and talk about the need for industrial reform. What they are really saying is that there is a need to cut the wages, conditions and entitlements of our workers in order to boost productivity. The truth of the matter is that Australia rates very highly in comparisons of productivity with the rest of the world. I am pleased to see that, at least in their published documents that they give to other countries, the Abbott government acknowledge the true state of affairs with respect to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most notable statistic in the report is that in 2015 Australian government debt is forecast to be 16.6 per cent of GDP. That figure compares with 74 per cent for the Euro area advanced economies, 80.9 per cent for the USA, 39.1 per cent for Canada and 27.2 per cent for New Zealand. Even New Zealand, which has the closest rate, is at almost twice the rate of Australia in terms of its debt ratio. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government's dishonest spin about government debt, blown out by its own inflated figures, simply does not stand up to scrutiny. We hear the Treasurer every day come into this chamber and talk about the huge debt that this country hasâI have no idea nor have I been able to ascertain where these figures have come from.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The debt crisis is being used to mask the coalition government's own incompetence and to justify its savage cuts on Australia's lowest income earners; to cut higher education funding; to dismantle Medicare; to cut $878 million of funding to research and science; to cut $80 billion to schools and hospitals; to change the indexation of pensions; and to cut Newstart payments to 26 weeks for under-30-year-olds. I could go on and on about the cuts made by this government since coming to office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its spin on debt and deficit, the coalition government constantly refers to intergenerational theft and the debt that is being left to future generations. I suggest that it will be a much greater debt left to those generations if you cut funding to our health and education systems and if you cut funding to those areas which create jobs and employment for the people of this country, which is exactly what this government is doing. This is a budget driven by the same misguided right-wing ideology that you will find in other capitalist countries around the world, and which is proven to have failedâan ideology of cutting taxes of higher income earners, cutting essential government expenditure, cutting wages and labour costs and cutting social payments. This results in your own citizens having less money to spend and being less able to maintain a stable economy. Then the government desperately attempts to find new markets by entering into poorly negotiated free trade agreements in order to boost income in the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Driving down wages through so-called deregulation and cutting government expenditure does not work, as several countries have already found out from experience. Nor can policies of one country be simply applied in another, as each country has distinctive characteristics and distinctive strengths and weaknesses which dictate how particular policy settings will play out. The effects of these policies are already becoming clear, despite the spin and fudging of the figures by Treasurer Hockey. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unemployment is the highest it has been since mid-2002âthat is, for over a decade. Even worse, the underutilisation rate is now nearly 15 per cent and, as Tim Colebatch points out in an excellent analysis of unemployment trends in 2014, for every new 100 adults added to the Australian population workforce, only 46 new jobs were created and, of those, only 28 were full time. Underemployment and unemployment reduce people's spending ability and, not surprisingly, retailers are experiencing some of their worst results, with retail sales growing by a weak 0.2 per cent in the month of December. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reducing Newstart payments when there simply are no jobs is the heartless policy of highly paid ministers and multimillion dollar earning private sector executives who would have no idea what it is like to try and live on $38 a day. Just as foolishly, it causes the economy and government finances to go in the wrong direction, to which the government's response is then more austerity. For example, under this government unemployment has risen by over 75,000 people across the country. If all of those people were on Newstart, the cost to taxpayers would be about a billion dollars a year. That is without factoring into account the lost tax revenue and other social costs that they might otherwise be entitled to. It would have cost the government far less to have supported the car makers of this country than to chase them out of Australia and now pay the unemployment benefits that arise and the other ongoing social costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a budget that, as I said from the outset, is in tatters. The government has indeed lost control of its budget, and its spin is also wearing thin for the Australian people. This legislation is testimony to the fact that the Treasurer has lost control of his budget. It ought to be condemned for what it is. I support the amendment moved by the shadow minister on our side, and say to members opposite, 'Stop trying to spin lines to the Australian peopleâthey are simply not accepting it.'</span>

I think there were large numbers of people around the world who were a little incredulous at that outcome. This was not because we do not have great affection for the Greeks. We doâwe recognise Greece as the birthplace of civilisation and democratic government in many respects. But the thing that struck as passing strange was that for a country that was so fiscally challenged, for a country so beset with debt and deficit, the majority of Greek people actually elected a government that said, 'We can ignore the financial challenges we have. The pathway forward is more spending. Sureâas a country, Greece is absolutely up to its eyeballs in debt, but don't worryâwe'll spend our way out of it, we'll borrow more money and we'll go forward more strongly than ever before.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who has dealt with debtâbe it a personal loan, be it credit card debt, be it a mortgage, or perhaps on a larger scale, be it in an enterprise or be it in governmentârecognises the folly of that approach. But that is not to say that there is not a certain siren song to that message. That is not to say that there is not a false attractiveness about being told when times are tough, 'Look, things don't need to be this tough. You're the victim here. You need to recognise that you don't actually have to undertake any of the financial hard work that goes with the circumstances you are facing but rather you can just wait and ask for more money, ask for more time or ask for others to do the heavy lifting when you yourself don't want to do it.' Instinctively, it is attractive. It is an attractive thing to say to someone who is burdened by a problem, be it financial or be it being overweight. I am overweight. If somebody said to me, 'Steve, you don't need to worry about the hard work that goes with making the right meal choices or exercising. She'll be right. We'll do it another way,' instinctively, it would be attractive. That is precisely what happened in Greece.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the same siren song that we hear from the Australian Labor Party today. I have seen Labor members stand up in this chamber in this debate around the appropriation bills and the budget and say how the Australian people have been unfairly punished, and I have heard Australian Labor Party members explain to people that it is quite okay because Australia's debt-to-GDP ratio is not that bad in the grand scheme of thingsâ'Hell, compared to Greece we look fantastic! Compared to Japan, you would say Australia never looked better.' You hear Labor members make this claim but if you know something about the history of this nation you know that our low debt-to-GDP ratio has nothing to do with the Australian Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former Labor government in six short years took us from $50 billion in savings to a pathway where we were approaching $667 billion of anticipated peak debt. Why? It was not because of any financial management on the part of the Australian Labor Party, no. The Labor Party just ran around and said that, pretty much, people could have whatever they wanted. That was their political formula for success. It was to not say no at any stage but just to say yesâ'If economic times are tough, rundown the assets, go into debt, borrow more money and say to the Australian people, "But we are doing it for a good reason. It's to save Australia from the GFC."'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They made promises about $80 billion of spending on health and education. They pushed it out beyond the forward years, beyond the budget estimates, into the out years so that they could say of their great vision, 'Look at us: we're the wonderful Australian Labor Party. We are going to put all this extra money into health spending. Don't worry, Aussie kids. We'll look after you. We're the Australian Labor Party and these are Labor values.' That is the kind of rhetoric that we hear from the Australian Labor Party. Day in and day out, it is the same old broken refrain. They say to Australian children, 'We've got your back, kids. It's all right. We're going to invest in your future.' But the money is never on the table. The money is always beyond the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I went to see school projects in my electorate when Labor were in government and I would see some Labor senator standing there, chest puffed out, crowing about Labor's great vision under the Building the Education Revolution, I would turn around to the students, parents or teachers who were there and say, 'I hope you enjoy this facility. I genuinely do.' I do hope they enjoy the facility that they paid for because they are going to paying off that facility for the next 20 or 30 years. Children in grade 6 will be paying off Labor's debt to build that school hall for 20 or 30 years. So I hope they enjoy those facilities because they are going to be paying for them for a very long time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor says, 'Don't worry about the debt-to-GDP ratios. Australia's is low.' That is just because of the fortitude of the previous coalition government which for 12 years worked and scrimped and saved to make sure that we paid down Labor's debt from last time to zero. Labor members say, 'Oh, no. It was the rivers of gold.' There is always a convenient excuse when you are in the Australian Labor Party. You must get it when you sign up. You must get your membership form and then get a book of excuses. Labor say, 'But it was the rivers of gold.' They conveniently ignore the fact that the terms of trade were better under the Australian Labor Party than they ever were under the coalition. If you want to talk about rivers of gold, the rivers of gold never ran so wide or so deep as they did when Labor was in power, and yet Labor still managed to spend tens of billions of dollars more money than they were able to recoup in revenue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can very comfortably say not only to my children but to other Australian children, 'I will never succumb to the temptation to tell you just what you want to hear.' Rather, I was elected into this chamber to stand up for what I know to be right, to reject a failed so-called pragmatic approach that says to future generations, 'We will steal off you to pay for today's spending.' That is Labor's approach. That is the Greens approach. That is the Palmer United approach. But it will not be the coalition's approach. I will never be part of a government that says to future generations, 'It is our right to put you in a worse position than we want to live in today.' Thank heavens our forefathers never did that. Thank heavens past generations of Australians never succumbed to the lazy, sloppy approach of the Australian Labor Party that says, 'Ah, she'll be right. You can pay it back in the future.' We have had bouts of that approach. Thankfully, they have been shallow bouts. But it was the coalition that did the heavy lifting to make sure that we paid down that debt back to zero.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to see what happens when you adopt Labor's approach, look at the United States's debt-to-GDP ratio. Look at Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio. Look at Europe's debt-to-GDP ratio. Look at what happens when countries box themselves into a fiscal corner, where debt and deficit is so bad that unemployment spikes to 25 per cent, 27 per cent or 28 per cent in southern European countries. Look at what happens when countries get themselves into a situation like the situation Greece got itself into, because that is precisely where this nation will end up if we adopt Labor's policy pragmatism. That is precisely where this country will end up if we follow, to the logical conclusion, Labor's approach that says that we do not need to worry about fiscal discipline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I readily concede that Labor's approach makes them more electorally popular. Sure, it is easy to be Santa Claus. It is easy to say to people, 'You can have whatever you want.' It is easy to run around the country saying, 'We're opposed to reductions in education and health'âeven though, incidentally, that is not real, because they were always in the so-called out-years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party runs around saying, 'We're appalled by reductions in foreign aid spending.' They run around saying, 'We don't like what is happening in terms of defence. We don't like the reductions in the motorcar industry. We don't like that there have been changes made to industry policy. We don't like that there have been changes proposed to Medicare. We don't like that there are proposed changes in relation to Welfare to Work.' All these things Labor is opposed to but, unfortunately, there is a price tag attached to every single one of them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The hypocrisy is laid bare when you consider that the Australian Labor Party today is still opposing billions of dollars worth of savings that Labor themselves announced. They announced them, they booked them as savings, and now they stand opposed to them in the Senate. Australians know that that is rank hypocrisy of the type that they have come to expect over the years from the Australian Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be part of a government that is involved in prudent decision-making and prudent investment. I am proud to be part of a government that does not tell people what they want to hear, but rather gives them the state of play as it actually is. We still have very significant challenges. We know that the budget deficit is still in the order of $30 billion or $40 billion. These are not insubstantial amounts of money; these are significant amounts of money, and they represent very real challenges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are still an array of important projects that this government has been able to fund out of the existing budget. And I am certainly pleased that the Gold Coast, Australia's sixth largest city, has been a beneficiary of a number of measures in the budgetâreasonable measures; measures that are sustainable; measures that are funded appropriately; measures that are important because they meet priorities of the people that I represent. The city has been the beneficiary, for example, of road funding, CCTV, Green Army projects, and even Commonwealth Games funding. These are important projects that matter to my electorate. They are projects that, sure, would be considered by some to be modest. But they are important projects because they make a difference to people's standard of living and they make a difference to the productivity of our city.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not going to stand up and make lofty claims about what a coalition government will be able to fund and be able to do. We have to live within our means. That is priority No. 1 for any government. The appropriation debate that we are having tonight really encapsulates the difference between this side of the parliament and Labor's side of the parliament. We will take the necessary action to make sure, as a country, that we live within our means and that we put downward pressure, over the medium to long term, on Australia's debt-to-GDP ratio and the level of debt and deficit. I cannot, in good faith, allow policy settings that see us borrowing $100 million a day, allow a situation where we spend $1 billion a month of borrowed money to pay interest on the debt that Labor left behindâforecast to reach $2.8 billion a month. That is $2.8 billion a month of interest repaymentsâborrowed money, every last dollar of itâto pay for the failed policies of the former Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, I am pleased that the coalition is prepared to take hard decisionsâsometimes unpopular decisionsâthat are in our national interest because they put as on a pathway to sustainability. We will make changes that are appropriate to reflect what we need to do in order to get reforms through the Senate, but the fundamental problem remains that the Labor Party, the Greens and members of the crossbench remain obstinate in their opposition to the tough but fair decisions that we have to make. There is no greater equityânot one!âin the life of any country than for one generation to leave the nation in a stronger position to the generation that follows it. That is something that Labor rejects but it is something I and the coalition will always embrace, and that underpins our policy approach, always.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:58</span>):  I think we have just seen one of the big problems in the debate on the economy at the moment, in that we have a government, which, on the one hand, is supposedly proud of its budget and proud of its appropriation bills, but which still thinks that the thing to do is to spend 15 minutesâin a rather biased way, I would have to sayâattacking the opposition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time I gave a speech in a debates on appropriation bills when we were in government, I always enjoyed speaking about the achievements of the government, and what was in those bills because I was very proud of them. As a nation, we want to address what are quite serious budget challenges. I do agree with the previous speaker in relation to that because there are changes in the worldâincluding changes in the countries with which we trade and changes in the way that Australia earns its revenueâthat have to be addressed. But we will not be able to address those serious challenges if the economic debate gets down to the level that we just heard from the government speakerâand not just because of the inaccuracies, which were all over it, but simply because they are very hard issues and there needs to be a level of truth and civility when we deal with them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak today about the latest quarterly Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry small business survey, which came out earlier this week. It is a survey established over 18 years ago which examines the business conditions of firms employing fewer than 20 people. People on both sides of this House recognise how important businesses of that size are. That is where our innovation comes from. That is where the pure research, the early stages of R&amp;D, come from. That is where the break-out ideas come from. Small businesses are also the driver of so many of our communitiesâthe local fruit shop and the local drycleaner, as well as our most innovative companies. They are incredibly important, and we all agree on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This survey is particularly robust. It is quite extensive in its scope, and the report is quite detailed. But a number of the results in the survey are really quite worrying, and both sides of this House should worry about them. The media statement for the survey says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ small business experienced painful trading conditions in the December quarter, with all indicators except for wages and other labour costs in contractionary territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"Some small comfort can be taken from the fact that the selling prices, profits, employment and investment indexes all rose, but they all remain mired in negative territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The index of Expected Economic Performance fell markedly for the fourth consecutive quarterâ</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and that is perhaps the most significant part because that is the indication of how businesses feel about the future, about the next year and the year after thatâ</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">and has now been below a 50 reading for three quartersâ</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">that is, in a row. It also reveals that small businesses are expecting future decreases in profits, employment, overtime, investment and selling prices. There are bits of good news in this survey as well. Once you go into it, you find little bits of hope here and there. But that is the story, overwhelmingly, in the media statement and, as you read the report, that is the thing that comes across, overwhelminglyâthat small businesses, businesses with fewer than 20 people, believe these are very tough times and things will not improve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I talk to business a lot. I come from a business background and I spend a lot of time talking to my local businesses, and they have known that something was wrong for quite some time. There has been a sense of unease for probably a year and, in the entrepreneurial sectors, almost despair that things are not moving. They keep looking to the government, they are expecting something from the government that is actually about growth and they are seeing very, very little of it. They see no sense of direction and no commitment to the future. There is also incredible uncertainty in a range of sectors, which is largely inflicted by the government and the piecemeal, almost knee-jerk, way it approaches the development of policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in a world of incredible opportunity. Our neighbours to the north are growing rapidly. The world both shrinks and expands at the same time. As we get closer together in terms of the capacity of technology, as businesses start to move across borders, as services move freely across borders, the world shrinks; and, when it shrinks, the opportunities expand like an explosion. The opportunities just expand every time the world gets smaller because of its connectedness. And the entrepreneurs of the world know it. The entrepreneurs in our suburbs and in our communities know it, and they are looking for leadership from the government to see what we are capable of, where our prosperity will come from. The only time we hear the government talk about 2050 is when they talk about how much the pension will cost. That is the only time you hear them talk about it. You do not hear them talk about where our prosperity will come from. You do not hear them talking about what the opportunities are, what the new markets are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can bet that even the competition review, which we expect to come down shortly, will deal with the competition between existing businesses and existing markets. You can bet it will not talk about this incredible expanding world, this explosion of opportunity, and how Australia competes in that. Similarly, when the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational report</span> comes down, you can bet that it will extend who we are now, our current expertise, our current sources of revenue and our current areas of enterprise into the future. You can bet that it will not say where our prosperity is going to come from as businesses, where our country is going to generate its revenue and how we get from here to there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that particularly concern me about this government is in the area of education, especially when we are talking about 2050. We know, for example, that our skills and capacity as a nation are actually in decline relative to the rest of the world. We know that from the reports on science, technology, engineering and maths, from the incredibly detailed studies of how Australia compares to the rest of the world in those areas, and we know that we are slippingâand we have been slipping for some time, under various previous governments. The blame can be sheeted home to both sides of this House over many, many years for the fact that we are falling behind in those areas and, in particular, falling behind in those areas relative to the rest of the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The natural advantage that we had because we inherited an extraordinary education system from our, essentially, British forebears and then, more recently, from many of our skilled migrants. We inherited a very, very well educated population and a way of educating others. But, over time, our competing neighbours, particularly to the north, who are now growing so fast, have been catching up and in some areas they are actually ahead of us. In the major cities of China, like Shanghai, a 16-year-old is already a few years ahead of our 16-year-olds in maths. We are already falling behind. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet we are not having a discussion in this House about how you invest in the future capacity of Australians. We are not having that debate, and we should be. We should be realising that a 35-year-old in 2050âa person who, arguably, might then be coming to the end of their highly creative input because the world will be moving so fastâis someone born this year; and the first two years of life, where a child learns so fast, is a bigger indicator of the success of that child at school and at university than any other period of their life. Yet we are not discussing that at all here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not talking about how you prepare a population for the world that we are moving into now, a world of incredibly rapid change and a world where we no longer have the advantage that we inherited. We have done very well with it; we have an education system which teaches people to think. It is an education system that our neighbours to the north are now trying to copy because their education systems have not taught people to think. We are incredibly creative and we teach people to think for themselves and think independently in our education system, and that is a great advantage. It is a great advantage, but it is an advantage which will fade as we are copied, as other nations come in and take our expertise and recreate it in their own schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be having very, very real conversations about the budget issues. We should not be talking just about government revenue, which the government seems to focus on a great deal. It seems to think that the only way to deal with the revenue-expenditure issue for a government is to cut spending, particularly to lower income and less advantaged people. But we are not having a discussion about how you actually raise the nation's revenue. Where does the revenue come from? We seem still to be a nation that is talking about mining, about what we dig out of the ground and what we grow in the ground. We sell it overseas, raise taxes from that and reduce taxes for our population, and they spend the money and buy bigger housesâand so it goes around. But we are not standing in this House talking about how we can encourage our small businesses and our big businessesâparticularly our small businesses, because they are better at itâto innovate in this rapidly changing world and to link our innovation to the innovation that is happening around the world. As the rest of the world shrinks and you find innovators getting together and working together across borders, we are not even having that debate in this House. We are not having a debate about the fact that Australia is one of the worst performing countries in the OECD in spending on innovation and R&amp;D. We did not get to that point in a short period of time. We actually got that way, with bits of ups and downs, through various governments. I could argue that we are better than you, but it is beyond that. We are now one of the worst performing countries in the world in innovation and R&amp;D. Innovation and R&amp;D is what will drive national revenue, and we are not doing it. We are incredibly poor. When you talk to successful businesses, relative to struggling businesses, one of the key things that a successful business will tell you is restraining their growth is access to capital, particularly access to venture capital. The struggling businesses tend to tell you it is red tape and government, but for the businesses that are doing very well that is low down on their list, and they will tell you that venture capital is a major issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we are talking about budgets, appropriations and budget issues we cannot simply have a discussion about where you cut. We cannot have just that conversation, although we do have to have that conversation. We lived in the Howard years during one of the biggest booms the world had seen in probably 100 years. Countries all over the world boomed, as did we. By the time the Howard government lost office we had the eighth-lowest debt in the world. We did reasonably well at paying off debt and had the eighth-lowest debt in the developed world. But during that time a lot of the boom money was spent on middle-class welfare and in tax cuts. There were decisions made then and in the government that followed that put us in a position where we cannot have a budget discussion that talks just about cuts. We cannot. We have to have a discussion that talks about where a country's prosperity comes from. It comes from its people and from its innovators and it needs a government that recognises its role in leading that debate, in finding the areas we have not even been yet. It needs a government that does not consider that when you look at the strengths of the Australian economy you look only at the things that we were good at last week. You cannot do that; the world is changing too fast. When you look at the areas that the government chose to prioritise you see it was mining and mining technology and it was agriculture. It was things that we already know we are good at.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my community three of the most successful businesses around manufacture, in large manufacturing plants in suburbs like Rydalmere, dietary supplements which they sell to China. They sell them to China because Australia is known as a country that knows how to be safe. It knows how to produce a safe product of high quality. That alone is valuable. There are countries around the world that are adopting our standards holus-bolus but not importing our skills. They are not importing our skills, because we have a government that does not recognise that quality and standards are actually a valuable commodity in their own right and not only make our goods exportable but make our people and services exportable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an enormous amount to talk about when we are talking about prosperity in this nation. We have an enormous amount to talk about when we are talking about bringing a budget back into balance over its cycle. Over a cycle you need to do that. We have an enormous amount to talk about, but as long as we have a government that is willing only to cut and to cut the most vulnerable, and as long as we have government members who simply want to stand up here, in their opportunity to talk about the future, about budgets, about growth and about prosperity, and spend their entire time taking shots at the previous government in slightly, in some cases extremely, exaggerated ways we are going to get nowhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I strongly urge the government to lift its gaze, to consider the full range of options and to stop this nonsense of saying that this cut is the only way it can be done, that the only way we can bring the budget back to surplus is to cut this particular group of people and that if you do not do it your evil and do not understand and are turning us into Greece. Not only is it nonsense but it really does not help. Lift your gaze, be a government and support the very people in our community who will make this country prosper.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HYM" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IRONS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:13</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2014-2015 and cognate bills and to take note of some of the comments that the member for Parramatta made. I was able also to catch the end of the speech made by the member for Moncrieff. I heartily endorse and echo the statements he made during the final five minutes of his speech. The member for Parramatta spoke about enabling small business and helping with funding for small businesses. I remember that during the 2007 election campaign, when I was first elected, I was taken to a technology park in my electorate. There were some fledgling businesses there who were funded by a program called Commercial Ready. Do you know what happened to that program, Member for Parramatta? It was scrapped by the new Labor government. The Rudd Labor government scrapped the Commercial Ready program, and two of those businesses that were in my electorate of Swan went to Singapore and got funded in Singapore. Why doesn't the member for Parramatta remember what her government did when it was in power, instead of trying to tell us that we are not doing the job of looking after small business?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to join with my colleagues in endorsing the important funding measures before the House, which will help ensure the government continues to meet important obligations to all Australian people, no matter their race, religion or socioeconomic status. One of these prime obligations is the protection of their safety at our borders and in our communities. I say that this is one of the government's primary obligations and coalition governments throughout Australia's history have been recognised by the Australian people for taking this very seriously and for being proactive in developing policies that appropriately meet this obligation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Swan, protecting our borders, law and order have consistently been two of the top issues raised with me since I was elected to this place in 2007. They are the top issues not because my constituents walk through Swan and constantly feel unsafe but because they understand that without law and order on our streets then this is exactly how they would and unashamedly should feel. It is also because they know that if our border protection officers were not preventing drugs and weapons from hitting our streets by diligently screening every person and every piece of mail that arrives in our country, then again their safety would be compromised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is for these reasons that I unreservedly endorse the approval of additional appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund that are being sought in the cognate appropriation bills before the House, as they seek to further bolster the protection of Australians through a range of measures. This includes $558 million being directed to the Department of Defence for overseas operations, becauseâunlike those oppositeâthe coalition government is one which understands how integral a country's defence force is. Rather than stripping $16 billion from the Defence portfolio as those opposite did, this coalition government has been working with the Department of Defence to carefully and methodically implement a fully funded white paper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I am sure those opposite will be shocked by this concept, but the reason this government has been systematically working through the Defence budget mess that was left to usâjust as we have been forced to do with every other government portfolioâis because those are normal processes for implementing good policy and running a good government. The examples I could give of the Labor Party's inability to govern this great nation would take me well through the night and probably into tomorrow. I just heard member for Moncrieff give some great examples as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The real kicker has always been the former Treasurer's promised surplus. All members on this side of the House are still trying to figure out where good old Swanny put it, but it has never appeared. This is despite the member for Lilley promising this imaginative surplus on more than 500 occasions in the 2012-13 financial year. There were no surpluses. They were nowhere to be found. The only thing the former Treasurer and the Labor Party delivered for this country is $200 billion in deficits, including $123 billion of future deficits. That is their only legacy. It is a legacy they should be ashamed of and one they should be working with the government, instead of against it, to fix.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike those opposite, this government recognises the value of our Defence Force and every member of its personnel not just for their ability to respond to threats against our country but also for their ability to assist in cases of great tragedy. Most recently, we witnessed this when Australia's Defence Force played a key role in the search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight, MH370. It is a search which I am saddened to say remains ongoing nearly one year on. I also welcomed the Assistant Minister for Defence's statement in this place earlier today, announcing this government's objective to recruit and develop a larger, more representative, culturally and linguistically diverse Defence Force to strengthen Australia's operational capability and to better reflect this country's multicultural society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this coalition government recognises the importance of adequately funding and appreciating our Defence Force personnel, I highlight that we also recognise the importance of developing and protecting our nation in other ways to ensure its long-term sustainability. It is because of this recognition that a key election policy of this government was to deliver the infrastructure of the 21st century to make our industries more productive, to create jobs and to alleviate congestion for road users. In my electorate of Swan, Western Australia's largest ever infrastructure projectâthe $1 billion Gateway WAâis now well on its way to competition, surpassing its 60 per cent completion mark just last month. I am very pleased to inform the House it is also six months ahead of schedule. Works on the $1.6 billion Perth Freight Link projectâwhich runs from the Kewdale industrial hub in my electorate of Swan to Perth's other major industrial hub, the Fremantle portâare also progressing, with the key focus of this project being to boost productivity for Perth's freight network. These are works that will benefit my home state in the long term thanks to funding efforts by this government and the WA state Liberal Barnett government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the enormity of these projects, my cabinet colleagues also heeded my calls for vital environmental funding to ensure the future sustainability of two of Perth's most iconic rivers, the Swan River and the Canning River, which run through my electorate of Swan. I was very pleased to welcome the Minister for Environment, the Hon. Greg Hunt, to Swan recently to formally launch the Swan-Canning Rivers Recovery Programme and highlight how this funding commitment will be utilised to safeguard the river systems' future biodiversity through weed eradication, practical community action and local government initiatives. I know that there are many volunteer groups within the Swan-Canning river catchment area. I know that they are very happy about the fact that this government made the commitment of a million dollars for that area to improve the biodiversity and to get rid of noxious weeds, particularly the hydrocotyle weed. Those community groups are led by many good people, like Russell Gorton, who is with the Wilson Wetlands Action Group. He has welcomed the opportunity to be engaged with other local groups to make an impact on the Swan and Canning rivers' biodiversity area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members opposite may ask how we managed to achieve all this on time and on budget. The answer is actually very simple, even though it was something those opposite have never managed to achieve. I also note that during those two terms when we went to elections promising a million dollars for that area, neither the Labor Party nor the Greens matched that offer. We developed a good policy, we costed it appropriately and then we managed it like a good government does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, as I previously mentioned, key aspects of the cognate appropriation bills that are before the House today relate to defence, foreign affairs and counter-terrorism measures. As members know, Australia's Customs and Border Protection Service plays a vital role in protecting the safety of all Australians. It is with this in mind that I am therefore also pleased to join with my colleagues in endorsing funding measures outlined in Appropriation Bill (No. 4), which includes just under $35 million for officers to perform additional counter-terrorism activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Monday, I welcomed the Prime Minister's national security statement, which outlined the government's latest move to combat home-grown terrorism, including the appointment of a national counter-terrorism coordinator and revoking the citizenship of any Australian proven to be involved in terrorism. This is necessary because the fight against terrorism simply cannot be won unless we are proactive about protecting our country and our people. It is funding such as this $35 million, which is outlined in the Appropriation Bill (No.4), that will help ensure Australia is best placed to respond to potential acts of terrorism on our home soil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have witnessed firsthand on more than one occasion the integral role Australia's Customs and Border Protection officers play in meeting Australia's national security objectives and combatting terrorism. In fact, it was only recently that I welcomed the opportunity to join with the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the Hon. Michaelia Cash, at Perth Airport's Customs House, which is within my electorate, to see how our Customs and Border Protection officers are working to keep every Australian safe, and to understand the scope of prohibited items that organised crime syndicates, in particular, try to smuggle through our borders every day. As was highlighted to me that day, from January to October last year over 12 kilograms of methamphetamine, or ice, 1.5 tonnes of molasses tobacco and over 2,000 prohibited weapons, including firearms knuckledusters, automatic knives, and laser pointers, were seized from air cargo by Perth's customs officers. While this is a significant achievement, Australia also has, for many years, recognised the abilities of detector dogs, which are often able to find even the most sophisticated concealed illicit imports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because the coalition government recognises the importance of bolstering security, whether it be on a local, state or national front, that in February 2014 we committed $88 million in funding to boost Australia's customs and border protection measures. This significant funding commitment was specifically focused on increasing screening of international mail and air and sea cargo, while an additional $8.5 million was also committed to expand our Detector Dog Program. In the 2014-15 budget we also committed a further $480.5 million toward a four-year package to bolster the enforcement capabilities of Australia's Strategic Border Command and our intelligence, trade and travel systems, and for workforce measures and training. In the case of national security, members would be aware that the government has also committed an additional $630 million over four years to counter-terrorism measures and has strengthened our intelligence agencies' ability to prevent and disrupt domestic terrorist threats. That is more than $1.2 billion in funding toward these crime preventative measures, before we even look at the number of local initiatives that are being rolled out in communities across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have stated, the prevention of crime in any form is a primary priority of this government, and it is consistently raised as a concern in my electorate of Swan. I am pleased to update the House on my work responding to these concerns since being elected to this place to fight for funding for a number of crime preventative measures in Swan. This has included a local action campaign to have additional security guards hired, increased CCTV and street lighting to reduce the rate of crime at Lynwood Village Shopping Centre, in my electorate of Swan, particularly in the shopping centre's carpark at night. Similar crime issues are also prevalent in another local government area of my electorate, the City of Belmont, and in particular at the region's main shopping centre, Belmont Forum. Many constituents from this area have contacted me over the years to raise their concerns about the rate of crime at the shopping centre and its surrounds. To respond to these concerns, I again initiated a local campaign to secure funding for the crime preventative measures, which, I am pleased to inform the House, were delivered by this government in our 2014-15 budget. At that time, I welcomed to Swan the Minister for Justice, the Hon. Michael Keenan, to join with me in announcing the government's $100,000 commitment to install additional CCTV around the perimeter of Belmont Forum and Belmont Village to help bolster Belmont Police's ability to find and prosecute criminals in the area. These are funding commitments that I am very proud to have secured for Swan, because I believe that there is nothing more important than protecting our communities and ensuring that every man, woman and child can feel safe at their local shopping centre or playground, and, most importantly, in their own home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, as my latest crime prevention campaign has revealed, this is not always the case, with many people in my electorate becoming the victims of crime purely because of where they live. I have been told repeatedly by constituents throughout my electorate that they believe living near a train station increases the level of crime in their suburb or in surrounding areas. This is also the key reason why residents in South Perth, which is another locality in my electorate of Swan, have repeatedly opposed plans by the West Australian state government to build a train station in the area. In fact, 71.9 per cent of respondents to my Tackling Train Crime community survey, which I distributed last October to residents and local business owners along the Armadale-Thornlie train line throughout Swan, specifically stated this belief. By way of background, the aim of the survey was to gain direct feedback about the perception of passenger safety on Perth's train network and the safety of those who live or work along the train line, as I do not believe the state government's current transit security model is adequately protecting passengers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Swan and across Australia, it is clear that the coalition government is doing everything it can to deliver the infrastructure, services and protection our communities need. But, like everything in this world, our policies need to be sustainable. Gone are the days of cash splashing by those opposite, and in its place is a government focused on delivering policies on budget and ahead of time, as is the case with the Gateway WA project in my electorate of Swan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality, though, is that there cannot be a sustainable Australia when we are still strangled by nearly $250 billion in debt. That is something this government has always known, so it is time those opposite got on board and recognised the good policies we are rolling out across Australia and the budget savings we are still generating, despite their inherent opposition to fixing the budget mess they left us with. I commend my cabinet colleagues and I commend the cognate bills to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:28</span>):  We have heard from many of the speakers before me on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2014-2015 and cognate bills that the bills are basically about supplyâthey are about appropriations. In the beginning of my contribution to this debate, however, I did just want to point out the contradiction within the government's argument. They say that this bill is about saving money. They say that they have had to cut savagely to get the budget back into surplus, or close to surplus. But yet, as we have heard from people on my side of the House, what we have seen in these bills and in the MYEFO is a $44 billion blow-out in the budget deficit over the forward estimates, compared to their original budget in 2014-15. Yet, at the same time that they have this blow-out, which would suggest to a common person that they are spending big, they are also making some pretty savage cuts in areas that affect so many in my community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Still, the government have on the table their cuts to pensions and the pension indexation. And the pension is not for millionaires; it is a very modest retirement income. People on the pension will be losing money as a result of decisions this government has made. The government's 2014 MYEFO also contains massive cuts to foreign aid.  Yet the government are saying that now, more than ever, at this very complex time, we need to engage in foreign policy and do what we can to help. Every day in question time we hear question after question on foreign policy. If the government were serious about stemming the violence occurring overseas, they would not have cut funding to education and other aid programs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has also been $250 million cut from the ABC and SBS, despite the Prime Minister saying before the election that there would be no cuts to the ABC and no cuts to SBS. In my electorate of Bendigo, we know too acutely how this cut will affect us. Not only have we lost <span style="font-style:italic;">Bush Telegraph</span>, a popular radio program for a number of ABC listeners in the bush; we have also lost the broadcasting of the WNBL, the Women's National Basketball League, for 2015-16. This Saturday will be the last broadcast match of the WNBL by the ABC, ending a 35-year relationship between this elite women's sports league and the ABC. The ABC says it is a direct result of the $250 million cut by this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a broader problem with this cut as well. It is not just the WNBL; it is also women's softball and a number of other women's sports. If we are ever going to get any form of equity in elite sports, there needs to be broadcasting. The ABC is a path to building a commercially viable operation. To lose funding, with broadcasting being so critical to the development of the WNBL, is disappointing. In my home own, the local coach of the Bendigo Spirit, Bernie Harrower, has said that this could mean that the Bendigo Spirit loses lots of sponsors. In fact, two sponsors have already indicated that they will not be supporting the club next year without those broadcasting opportunities. This means that the basketball club will have less in their kitty to pay their players. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Basketball Australia and the coach of the Australian Opals have told me that our current WNBL is the third best in the world and that opportunities for women to play in their home country at an elite level help to build the Opals. The loss of the WNBL would not only be a problem for fielding a strong Opals team; it would be a loss of really positive role models for young women. At a recent Bendigo Spirit match, I spoke to a father who said that, just as he likes to sit and watch football with his young son, he likes to sit and watch basketball with his young daughter. To me, that speaks to the problem of these funding cuts and how, again, for such a small amount of money, the government is missing the broader responsibility of equity and ensuring that women can continue to have the same opportunities as men when it comes to elite sport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also a revised higher education package of reforms and the GP tax, both of which seem to be unravelling; we are not sure what is going on. Today we heard that the government might drop its GP taxâbut we do not know. Today we heard that the government is still going to push ahead with its higher education reformsâ but we do not know. All of these assumptions in the budget bottom line of 2014-15 still incorporate the GP tax and the harsh and unfair measures that I have outlined. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of other cuts that will hurt the Bendigo electorate, including cuts to health and hospitals, with a cut of $25 million to the Bendigo hospital over the next two years. The GP tax has been rejected over and over again by rural doctors. They simply argue that it will put pressure on emergency and urgency waiting rooms. There is no clear indication from the government about what they will do for urgency care. Currently, local GPs on rotation staff urgency care units in regional towns with fewer than 8,000 people. These GPs essentially work overtime on weekends, on rotation. If a patient presents, they bulk-bill them automatically. That is how they are paid for doing that work. If we enforce a compulsory GP tax or co-paymentâwhatever language you want to useâthey first have to say to the person who presents at urgency care, 'Where is your $5?'âor $7 or $20, whatever the government wants to put forwardâbefore they treat the patient. The doctors in my electorate have said that their chances of recovering that money are limited. It also creates an unfair burden on doctors and medical staff who just want to treat a patient in an urgency care situation. As one doctor in Woodend said to me, when he does his rounds of the urgency care or aged-care facilities in Kyneton, is he expected to have his accountant next to him collecting the $5 or $7 or $20 before he treats the patient? He even suggested that perhaps the government could look at having a system that operates like a coffee card, where you pay for nine trips and get the 10th trip for free, and maybe people could start paying up-front. Those are the kinds of debates and conversations that are happening as a result of this government's plan to introduce the GP co-payment. Again, I come back to the point that they are proposing all these drastic cuts and imposing extra costs on some of our most vulnerable households, yet they still have this massive blow-out in their budget. It suggests that their funding priorities are not the priorities of the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another big cut in my area is to the Australian Emergency Management Institute. The story is a classic one of: 'Really? Seriously, did the government make this mistake?' The Australian Emergency Management Institute's home is at Mount Macedon and currently employs 50 people directly and 20 contractors. It is the place where we bring our emergency management professionalsâwhether state or federalâtogether to brainstorm, learn, teach and pass on best practice when it comes to emergency management. That description does not do justice to the quality of the courses and the work that they do there. Post every bushfire season, post every flood and post every cyclone, they get together. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The loss associated with the closing of this facility by this government is not only limited to the redundancies they need to pay out to the people there who chose not to relocate to Canberra and to the cost to the local community of losing public sector jobs; the government has now discovered that to re-establish that institute in Canberra is more expensive than keeping it currently running at Mount Macedon. To hire people in Canberra with skills equal to those who worked at the Mount Macedon facility will actually cost the government more in salary dollars. Because this is the public sector capital and wages are higher here than they are at Mount Macedon, it is going to cost the government more money to shut down this facility and move it back to Canberra. Perhaps that is a small part of the reason why this government's budget is blowing out. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another cut which the government says is necessary and which is impacting on my local community is the cut to local government assistance grants. A local government in the city in Melbourne might not be that fussed about this cut: they can whack up parking meters or introduce parking meters. That is simply not possible in regional local government areas. In areas like the Loddon Shire, for example, where they have a very large geographical area but are reducing the rate-paying base, these cuts will just put more pressure on fewer and fewer ratepayers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The City of Greater Bendigo, which is the largest local government area in my electorate, believes that this freezing of the indexation of local government grants will cost the city about $2.7 million. Again, that is not a lot in the broader context of the federal budget but it means a lot to the local government area who, as we speak, are debating whether they pull out of delivering HACC services and community based health services for their community, and are talking about closing childcare centres. This is what happens when this government chooses to target small organisations and regional organisations. They think that, if they trim a bit here and a bit there, it will all work out in the end. Where they are targeting their trimming is having a massive impact. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also heard this week in parliament about the cost of cutting Community Assistance Grants. These grants go to organisations who help those in financial stress get out of trouble. In my electorate, the Bendigo Family and Financial Services found out on Christmas Eve that they would no longer receive funding. This is an organisation that runs on the smell of an oily rag. They have 10 part-time employees and 70 volunteers, and these people get together to offer small loans to people seeking help, emergency food relief as well as financial counselling services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As one client said to me: 'I sat down. They looked through my debts and they helped me work out what my priorities were. They said to me that, 'If you come in here every week for the three months, collect a food hamper and spend the money that you were receiving on paying down these debts, then you will get yourself out of trouble'.' This man said, 'It was a big deal for me to admit that I needed to live off food relief and handouts for three months to get myself out of debt, but I would not and have been able to get myself out of debt if it was not for the financial counselling and support from this organisation.' Today, as I speak, the organisation is counting down to when their funding will run out. I am concerned about the number of families who will not be helped in the future, because this government has cut their grant going forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fuel tax increase, job cuts at the ATO, country students finding it harder to go to university, Gonski funding that has gone missing and our schools saying that they are worse off, the GP tax and attacks on pensionersâthe list goes on and on about what this government is doing to regional communities. Again, it comes back to the initial point that I made: in these three bills the government is spending an extra $1.7 billionâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:43</span>):  The Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2014-2015 and cognate bills collectively seek to authorise approximately $1.74 billion in additional expenditure since the 2014-15 budget to provide for the ordinary annual services of the government; capital works and services; payments in respect of the states, territories, and local government authorities; and to fund the services of parliamentary departments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A particular government program that I would like take this opportunity to highlight is the Emissions Reduction Fund, which will support Australian businesses and households to take practical and direct action to reduce emissions and improve the environment. The objective of the Emissions Reduction Fund is to help achieve Australia's emissions reduction target of five per cent below the year 2000 levels by 2020. The government has provided $2.55 billion to establish the Emissions Reduction Fund, with further funding to be considered in future budgets. The Emissions Reduction Fund implements a long-term framework for stable and sustainable climate change policy. It provides incentives to seek out innovations that reduce both costs and emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cite a practical example of industrial innovation within my electorate. Engas Australasia Pty Ltd is a company based in the Neerabup Industrial Area which specialises in the distribution of blended hydrocarbon refrigerants used in air-conditioning and commercial chiller applications. These environmentally-friendly refrigerant gases have both zero ozone depletion impact and negligible global warming potential when compared with conventional hydrofluorocarbon chemical-based refrigerants, which are widely used in industry. Furthermore the hydrocarbon refrigerants are more energy efficient with tests indicating that air conditioning and refrigeration compressor units using the new gases can save up to 50 per cent in power consumption costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the environmental performance of Australian buildings is measured by the National Australian Built Environment Rating System, which is a national, industry-recognised rating system that measures the energy efficiency, water usage, waste management and indoor environment quality of a building and its impact on the environment. It does this by using measured and verified operational performance information, such as utility bills, that is adjusted for the size and use of the building and converted into a star rating scale ranging from one star to six stars, representing market leading performance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration industry in Australia is a $6 billion a year industry which employs 170,000 individuals. There are approximately 45 million installations of vapour compression-type refrigeration and air conditioning units in Australia. These units consume 22 per cent of the total amount of electrical energy generated in this country and are responsible for 12 per cent of national carbon dioxide emissions, amounting to 64.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum. The safe use of refrigerants is specified by regulations and industry standards. Australian Standard AS1677-1998 includes comprehensive procedures for the safe use of all refrigerants including hydrocarbons. The Hon. Bob Baldwin, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, has visited the Engas Australasia factory and showroom in Neerabup to view the operations and testing facilities first hand. The directors of the company, Messrs Brian Foster and Selwyn Wallace, have invested a considerable amount of resources to raise awareness and promote the use of hydrocarbon refrigerants as an alternative to the conventional hydrofluorocarbon chemical-based refrigerants which are widely in use. They have been met with considerable opposition from larger competitors, and have experienced bureaucratic obstacles in having their product accredited in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of more energy efficient and environmentally friendly refrigerants represents an innovative direct action that will achieve measurable benefits in emissions reduction based on the evidence provided. It is likely to have a major impact, with approximately 45 million vapour compression-type refrigeration and air-conditioning units in Australia. Internationally, most major economies are committed to meeting emissions reduction targets. On 12 March 2014 the European Union Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of legislation to phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbon chemical refrigerants. Presidents Obama of the United States and Xi of China reached agreement in principle at their San Francisco summit in early June 2014 to use the institution of the Montreal protocol and its proven methods to phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbon chemical refrigerants by 2030. Similarly, the G20 nations, representing 85 per cent of global economic output, signed an agreement in September 2014 to phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants by two-thirds below present levels by 2030.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the government introduced the Carbon Farming Initiative Amendment Bill 2014, which established the Emissions Reduction Fund. The Emissions Reduction Fund expands on the Carbon Farming Initiative by extending the scope of eligible emissions reduction activities and by streamlining existing processes. The ERF has three elements: crediting emissions reductions, purchasing emissions reductions, and safeguarding emissions reductions. Engas Australasia is in the  early stages of participating in the Emissions Reduction Fund compliance process. Subsection 106(1) of the act empowers the minister to make, by legislative instrument, a methodology determination. The purpose of a methodology determination is to establish procedures for estimating emissions abatement from eligible projectsâsetting rules for monitoring, record keeping and reporting. These methodologies will ensure that the emissions reductions are genuine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee is an independent expert panel that will advise the minister on proposals for methodology determinations. The minister will also consider any adverse environmental, economic or social impacts likely to arise as a result of projects to which the determination applies. The ERAC must include in its advice to the minister the committee's opinion on whether the proposed determination complies with the proposed offsets integrity standards to be set out in section 133 of the act. The offsets integrity standards require that an eligible project should result in carbon abatement and that the amounts are measurable and capable of being verified; the methods used are supported by clear and convincing evidence; material emissions which are a direct consequence of the project are deducted; and estimates, assumptions or projections used in the determination should be conservative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Offsets projects that are undertaken in accordance with the methodology determination and approved by the Clean Energy Regulator can generate Australian carbon credit units, representing emissions reductions from the project. Project proponents such as Engas Australasia can receive funding from the ERF by submitting their projects to a competitive auction run by the Clean Energy Regulator. The government will enter into contracts with the successful proponents which will guarantee the price and payment for future delivery of emissions reductions. The Emissions Reduction Fund will support a wide range of energy efficiency projects in industrial facilities, such as upgrading boilers, improving control systems and processes, installing co-generation facilities, and increasing the efficiency of compressed air systems. These projects will improve business productivity while also cleaning up the environment. Project proponents wishing to implement projects such as the introduction of blended hydrocarbon refrigerants are required make an application to the regulator under section 22 of the act. They must also meet the general eligibility requirements for an offsets project, set out in subsection 27(4), which include compliance with the requirements set out in the draft determination, and the additional requirements in subsection 27(4A) of the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Emissions Reduction Fund will support Australian businesses to take practical, direct action to improve their energy efficiency. The benefits of lower energy consumption include lower operating costs and improved competitiveness for businesses. Similarly, commercial building owners will be able to generate emissions reductions from energy efficiency projects for large offices, large shopping centres, hotels, and data centres. These projects will allow businesses to reduce their operating costs. To date, Engas Australasia has undertaken a number of hydrocarbon refrigeration demonstration projects, including the re-gassing of commercial coolrooms and freezer units in suburban supermarkets, and air-conditioning in office buildings and in motor vehicles. Considerable interest in the technology has been generated from potential overseas export markets. The proprietors of Engas are entrepreneurs who have invested significant resources in developing and marketing this innovative new product. During this time, they have encountered opposition from large industry competitors and have battled red tape from bureaucracy. The economic development and export market potential arising from the successful testing and accreditation of the technology is significant. All that is required is an accessible and equitable assessment process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the passage of this bill, the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2014-2015, and related appropriations bills will ensure the continuity of the government's programs and the Commonwealth's ability to meet its estimated expenditure obligations for the current financial year, including for existing and new programs in 2014-15. In particular, the Emissions Reduction Fund is an example of a program which will support Australian businessesâsuch as Engas Australasiaâto take practical, direct action to reduce emissions and to improve our environment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:56</span>):  This debate in the chamber tonight on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2014-2015 and related bills is a very important one. It is a debate that needs to take the time of this parliament because of its significance, not only for the people of Australia today but also for the generations that will follow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is critically important to understand that the appropriations bill will, in the way that has been set forward, do much to help start the budget repair process that is so necessary for our country to be put on a sustainable financial path. Why is it necessary to be put on a sustainable financial path? One only needs to look to examples overseas to realise how critical this is. If one were to take, for instance, the example of Ireland where they had a net debt to GDP ratio of something like 11 per cent just before the global financial crisis; after the global financial crisis hit, in six short years that figure went up to beyond 30 to 40 per cent of net debt to GDP. It goes to show how quickly a budget situation can deteriorate. Currently, Australia's net debt to GDP is around about 15 per cent. But we cannot take for granted the position that we find ourselves in. It requires action, and it requires action today. This is why we have a focus on this Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2014-2015 and related bills, to ensure that we can put the Australian budget on a financial footing that is strongâand one that will reward future generations, not take from future generations. Would you like me to continue, Madam Speaker?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PLIBERSEK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:00</span>):  The Sydney Mardi Gras is now a festival that lasts for just over two weeks with film, theatre, visual arts and community events. It brings about $30 million into our local economy and provides an opportunity for many Sydneysiders and international guests to enjoy the beautiful sights of our city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just over a week ago I was at Victoria Park, in my electorate, for Fair Dayâa day of fun and family; it falls at the beginning of the festival each year. I joined Penny Sharpe, Verity Firth and members of Rainbow Labor in planting our own hearts in the Sea of Hearts. This symbol of the fight for equality reminded me that Sydney's Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras has always contained within it, not just fun and frivolity, but a very serious message of demanding equality before the law. As well as Fair Day, I saw a terrific play at Belvoir Street, <span style="font-style:italic;">Blue Wizard</span> by Nick Coyleâanother example of the cultural events that are on for the whole period of Mardi Gras.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first Mardi Gras march in 1978 was Sydney's contribution to the international Gay Solidarity Celebrations. It was quite violent; it was met by police violence and many people were arrested. While few charges were laid, <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> published the names of those who were taken into custody. Many people who had not been out to friends and family were outed in the newspaper, and some of them lost their jobs because of it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we live in a very different community now and the police in New South Wales, and Sydney in particular, take very seriously their responsibility to provide a safe opportunity for Mardi Gras participants to express their desire for equality before the law. Legal discrimination and social discrimination have reduced in many respects. It has long been unacceptable to discriminate against people in Australia on the basis of their skin colour or other personal attributes. I hope that we are moving to that time of reduced discrimination based on sexuality as well. Unfortunately, despite the fact that many laws have now been changed since the first Mardi Gras march in 1978, one remains unchanged and it must be changed by this parliament. That, of course, is marriage equality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By the year after the first Mardi Gras the Wran government in New South Wales had repealed the Summary Offences Act, under which the 1978 arrests were made. It was a major civil rights milestone for all citizens of New South Wales and it reminds us how very quickly things can change. Three thousand people marched in the second march in 1979, and last year there were 10,000 people watched by 300,000 people, celebrating diversity, inclusion and equality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Sydney Mardi Gras, as I said, is a major international tourist attraction and a huge boost for Sydney's economy. Anybody who lives in Sydney or who visits during Mardi Gras season remarks on the terrific feeling on the streetsâmuch like the celebrations we had during the Sydney Olympics, which I am sure you enjoyed very much, Madam Speaker. As we celebrate Mardi Gras in coming weeks, we should always remember that, while this is a time to celebrate diversity, it is always a time to fight for equality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be a great Mardi Gras present to the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer community for the Prime Minister to announce that Liberal members of parliament will be allowed a conscience vote on my private member's bill, a bill for an act to amend the Marriage Act 1961, to establish marriage equality for same-sex couplesâand it would be even better if one of the Liberal MPs who I know supports marriage equality would second that bill. I wish everyone a happy Mardi Gras.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="PK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RANDALL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:05</span>):  I wish to bring to the House's attention to some telecommunication issues in the electorate of Canning. Specifically I would like to address two areasâmobile phone coverage and port availability. For the benefit of the House, Canning covers a vast area of over 6000 square kilometres, made up of outer-metropolitan suburbs as well as some semi-rural areas. Like the electorates of members on both sides, my electorate boasts a wide range of industries and business types, including mining, mixed agricultural and retail. Canning is also home to over 150,000 people, and the northern part of my electorate is among the fastest growing regions in the country. One of the things residents and businesses of Canning most certainly have in common is a need for access to adequate mobile phone coverage and superfast broadband. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing members opposite know nothing about is what it is like to be part of a government that boasts an effective communications minister, who is dedicated to delivering real results in real time. Not surprisingly, under the previous government, very little funding was provided to keep improving Australia's mobile phone coverage in the outer metropolitan region and the remote communities in electorates like Canning. After all, it was the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd who abolished the coalition's $2.4 billion Communications Fund and squandered the money held in reserve to pay for further upgrades of telecommunications in rural, regional and remote parts of Australia. And then there was Labor's shambolic approach to the NBN, which Minister Turnbull most accurately described as an 'arthritic snail' when it was at the mercy of the former communications minister, Senator Conroy. The fact of the matter is that, after three years, Labor's NBN was already two years behind schedule. The cost, as we now know, was going to skyrocket to $79 billionâ$29 billion more than Labor promised it would cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But was any of this their fault? Of course, it was not. Senator Conroy was quick to pass the buck and attempt to blame to NBN contractors for the delays. Frankly, Labor's unmitigated NBN disaster can be attributed wholly and solely to members opposite who chose to treat the initiative like a political football. As we know, Labor did not even have the forethought to run a basic cost-benefit analysis on the NBN, and thus the project was undertaken without a basic understanding of the availability of broadband.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a member representing a vast electorate such as Canning, I know that the availability of broadband is incredibly important to the constituents in an electorate like mineâconstituents like Sharon Hunt, a single mother living in the electorate with high school-age children. Not only does Ms Hunt rely on quality internet services to aid the education of her children but she also runs a small business from home. Unfortunately, Ms Hunt's area has been plagued with ADSL port availability issues, and Telstra have been unwilling to come to the partyâwhich is unusual, because they are generally good. Thankfully, Ms Hunt can be reassured that we on this side understand the importance of access to superfast broadband and are working hard to ensure that the worst served areas in Australia in electorates such as mine are prioritised. We have already seen this in areas such as Mandurah, and more recently in Barragup and Furnissdale, where work on the NBN is set to begin in the coming weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to take this opportunity to highlight difficulties being faced by a second constituent, Mr Jon Yovich, who lives in the north of my electorate. Mr Yovich's property is approximately 36 kilometres south of Perth CBD, yet he is unable to get adequate phone coverage. Perhaps if members opposite had not abolished the coalition's $2.4 billion Communications Fund, areas like Mr Yovich's would not have been overlooked for desperately needed base station upgrades. In fact I continually hear of cases similar to Mr Yovich's when I travel throughout the electorate and speak to my constituents. He has to go out on his back lawn to even use his phone. I have constituents in situations where lives can quite literally depend on access to mobile phone coverage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, I am now in a position where I can say to the residents of Canning that the coalition government is now making a huge difference. The Mobile Black Spot Program will see $100 million committed over four years to improve mobile phone coverage in the areas that need it most, such as in Karnup and areas where bushfires are a huge issue and they need mobile phones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last coalition government, the Howard government, made the elimination of mobile phone black spots a national priority, and so has this government. I sincerely thank the Minister for Communications, the member for Wentworth, and the member for Bradfield for their commitment to thisâfor doing something that Labor did not even try to do. This is about to change. I want to see this implemented, because we have the opportunity to make a difference to people's internet and telecommunications issues.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:10</span>):  When Mary Aikenhead established the Sisters of Charity, she proclaimed that the poor should have for love what the rich have for money. A not-for-profit organisation, the Sisters of Charity have been serving the people of Australia since 1838, with a particular emphasis on helping the poor and disadvantaged. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Sisters of Charity are probably best known for the establishment of St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney but their philanthropic and charitable work extends way beyond the establishment of that important health facility. Among their good work, the sisters make special grants for charitable public purposes that promote their mission. One such program is the Sisters of Charity Tertiary Scholarship Program, which in recent years has grown and now offers eight scholarships to students throughout New South Wales. The sisters' scholarship is aimed at creating life-changing opportunities for people who as children lived in out-of-home care or foster care, growing up without the stability and support of a long-term traditional family unit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are an estimated 40,000 people nationally who share that history. Sadly, only around three per cent of young people who have lived in out-of-home care will go to university, compared to 40 per cent of young people currently in their early 20s. The Sisters of Charity Foundation seeks to rectify that disparity, and with the help of universities, including the Australian Catholic University, the University of Melbourne, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Queensland and the University of Sydney, the sisters are able to offer eight scholarships to young people who have a dream of establishing and receiving a tertiary education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One such young woman is Amber Boatman, who on 17 December last year became the first student to graduate from this wonderful program. Amber completed her Bachelor of Laws from the University of Notre Dame. Amber grew up in a single-parent family with a mother who battled drug and alcohol addiction. When her mother died of an overdose, Amber was separated from her brothers and placed in foster care. Needless to say, her early life was marked by instability and a lack of support. But with a little help from the Sisters of Charity Foundation and Amber's dedication, hard work, intelligence and indeed her dream of receiving a tertiary education, her skills shone through, allowing her to earn a degree. She now works part time at an Aboriginal legal service. One of the fascinating things I find about people who receive these scholarships is that once they do complete the scholarships they put back into the community. They give back, and Amber is a great example of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the scholarship recipients, Shantell, said about the program:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Receiving the Sisters of Charity Foundation scholarship has made university an achievable goal. I was placed in foster care from a young age and I have lived independently since the age of 16. The scholarship will help me fast track my path to become a registered nurse. Whilst I would not change my life, the scholarship helps me to bridge the gap between what others have had, living with their parents, and what I have had in having to support myself. Being a recipient of this scholarship will also benefit my six siblings. This will show them that goals and dreams are achievable. I would love the opportunity to break the stereotypes about young adults like myself who are labelled 'foster children' and have low educational outcomes. I want to prove to everybody, as well as to myself, that I am capable and determined â¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shantell and Amber are great examples of what young children can achieve if they are given the opportunity. The Sisters of Charity provide that opportunity for young people throughout New South Wales. I congratulate the Sisters of Charity Foundation. I thank all of their donors for their generosity. Of course, the sisters are always looking to expand the scholarship program. I commend them on their wonderful work to help young people overcome the odds and achieve their educational dreams, and I encourage other tertiary education institutions to get on board.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="72184" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:15</span>):  I rise to speak about government achieving value for money and the concept in reality of reverse tariffs. Achieving value for money is always important in any transaction, but it is critical when you are purchasing $40 billion worth of goods and services with third party funds. This is the situation that the federal government departments find themselves in annually. State and local governments also have enormous procurement, and a similar principle of achieving value for money is just as paramount for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regular transactions of size by the federal government mean that government decisions exercise enormous influence in the markets in which they purchase goods. Long-term government supply contracts often run for years and can deliver successful tenderers a degree of certainty and an ability to plan and enact long-term efficiencies to put a solid base under their businesses that allows them to invest and achieve other outcomes that otherwise would not be possible. On the flip side, the loss of a long-term contract, whether it is with a private purchaser or government, can render any business a major blow. But many Australian domicile companies producing goods are often unsuccessful at securing government contracts on the basis that value for taxpayer dollars is equated to the lowest ticket price alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is entirely sensible and good practice in business-to-business transactions to assess value for money on the criteria of ticket price and quality of goods that fit the purpose alone. But it is not exactly the same for governments as different consequences follow government transactions. Governments not only own the good or service but also can recoup a large slice of the purchase price if they purchase from Australian domicile producers. When a federal, state or local government department purchase goods from genuine domestic based producers, treasuries can potentially receive a rebate of up to 40c in the dollar between all of them down the line from PAYE tax, Medicare levies, company tax and GST as well as all of the same from associated local suppliers who benefit from the local economic multiplier effect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are even benefits to the humble local council government with councils raising rates from businesses and employees as well as equipment purchases of businesses in their local area that attract miscellaneous fees and charges. The Department of Social Security also benefits when local employment continues and government avoids the subsequent liabilities of Newstart benefits and employment stimulus and retraining programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Decisions on huge government purchases appear to be too often made within departmental silos without the costs of benefits to Treasury or Social Security being assessed. For example, in the paper industry, manufacturers recently asserted that 15 of 22 federal government departments purchased simple A4 copy paper and other paper supplies from overseas manufacturers. Yet recently one plant in the Shoalhaven announced its closure, and 75 people will soon be unemployed. This same paper industry have analysed their benefits to government. For every ream of paper they produce locally, the government gets an immediate return of $1.88. All across the country, returns in taxes from local production amount to $430 million annually.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently an Australian boot manufacturer was unsuccessful in a government tender that was awarded to a company importing boots produced and assembled overseas. How ironic and sad that that same bootmaker is now applying for federal government assistance for retraining and transitional programs that were designed for automotive manufacturers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Too often government departments are ignorant to or do not calculate the impact of long-term embedded government regulation standards and taxes that function as reverse tariffs as the competitors of domestic companies are excused compliance with them. They all increase the price of Australian products, and it is very hard for any company to tender in competition with overseas competitors when the same government ties the hands of local companies behind their backs with red, green and industrial relations tape and taxesâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:20</span>):  The federal Liberal government's cruel and chaotic cuts to community service funding have hurt community organisations across the country and reduced the help they can provide to the most vulnerable Australians and certainly older Australians. There are about 350 community organisations in Blair. The federal Liberal government has unleashed enormous uncertainty across the community sector with its $270 million cut to the Department of Social Services discretionary grants program since the last budget. There have been further cuts to the sector, particularly in the Allowances, Concessions and Services for Seniors Program, often refer to as Broadband for Seniors, which is a program providing about 2,000 Broadband for Seniors kiosks across Australia where seniors can have free access to computers, training and the internet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government compounded this apprehension across the sector with its chaotic restructuring of the grants program. The government's bungling has caused significant delays in the processing of applications and in advising applicants of outcomes. Just before Christmas, in an act that can only be described as worthy of the Christmas Grinch, the federal Liberal government cut funding to many organisations around the country. I want to talk tonight about two in my electorate in relation to the uncertainty created, the problems in relation to continuation of funding and the challenges that these organisations currently have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new social services minister was forced to provide bridging funding to organisations while the government scurried to sort out its mismanagementâthe third of such bridging funding that was required. The government's grants process has been shambolic, and I welcome the forthcoming Senate inquiry into this process and the impact it has had on the community sector. What is clear now, though, is that the federal Liberal government has diminished the capacity for a whole range of community organisations to deliver emergency relief, financial counselling, volunteering and settlement services in their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Care and Concern is a charity based in the town of Esk in the Brisbane Valleyâoften now referred to as the Somerset region. It provides practical, often short-term support to people in need in the Somerset region. The assistance that Care and Concern provides is personal and discreet. It helps those at their lowest ebb. It gives families a hand to get back on their feet after natural and personal disasters. It does so without fanfare. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The organisation traces its origins to the two Catholic sisters who began St Vincent de Paul support in Esk, over thirty years ago. Some years later, the sisters secured Commonwealth emergency relief funding to begin Care and Concern. When the sisters retired after their long service to the community, a team of local volunteers took over the organisation. It remains separately managed and audited.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been deeply appreciative of the work of Care and Concern for many years, even before I was the federal member for the area. I witnessed Care and Concern's exceptional effort to assist residents who were devastated by the 2011 and 2013 floods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Reg Mills is the secretary-treasurer of Care and Concern. He told me his organisationârun by volunteers ârelies on the annual Commonwealth emergency relief funding it receives. Last year the government cut the funding. Mr Mills told me that most grants are project oriented and do not fit with providing short-term support to a person with no cash whose car has broken down in Esk, or a woman whose domestic circumstances have deteriorated. The reality is that the Abbott government's cuts will force a significant reduction in the services Care and Concern can provide. I call on the government to reverse this decision. I wrote to the minister last week, asking him to reinstate the funding. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second organisation I will mention here is SeniorNet, based in Ipswich and operating the Broadband for Seniors kiosk at the University of Southern Queensland's Ipswich campus in my electorate. When we were in government, the Labor government established close to 2,000 Broadband for Seniors kiosks. Broadband for Seniors helps seniors get better access to online services. SeniorNet Ipswich has performed admirably. I want to commend President Ken Curwen, Vice-President Gordon Timbs, Jenny Greaves, Errol Elliott, Colleen Freeman and many others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, like so many Broadband for Seniors organisations, their grant is now in limbo. They have now received their second transitional extension and their funding runs out at the end of April. The government mentioned this to them a number of times, and they have been in touch with the government. The government has left organisations like SeniorNet in the lurch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Worryingly, Broadband for Seniors may be another program tangled up in the government's bungled restructure of the Department of Social Services and its many programs. I call on the government to sort this mess out, to give certainty to these two wonderful organisations, Care and Concern and SeniorNet in Ipswich. They are two wonderful organisations that need their support.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E07" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARKUS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:25</span>):  I rise to reflect on the opening of the Hydro Majestic Hotel at Medlow Bath in the Blue Mountains. It was a delight to welcome the Treasurer, the Hon. Joe Hockey, to the electorate of Macquarie to preside over the official opening of one of the region's most iconic venues on the 30 January this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the opening of this beautiful historical site, the Treasurer and I held an economic roundtable, giving the presidents of local associations and business chambers the opportunity to discuss local achievements and issues important to them. The Hydro Majestic is a powerful symbol of grandeur in the Blue Mountains, which has prevailed for many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hydro Majestic was founded in the 1890s and built as a hydropathic spa in 1904 by local retailer Mark Foy. By 1909 it was transformed into a hotel of glamourous and ambitious proportions. It is an iconic building that reflects a bygone classical era. The prominent dome featured in the casino room near the entrance of the hotel was originally sourced by Mr Foy from Chicago, and transported to the Blue Mountains by train.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the stewardship of Huong Nguyen and George Saad of the Escarpment Group, this unique landmark has undergone extensive renovation and restoration over the past six years. The Hydro Majestic we have today represents an investment of $35 millionâand investment into the tourism and hospitality industry of the local region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The transformation has not been without challenges over these six years. As with many dreams, visions become a reality as a result of many hours, days, months and, in this case, years of planning, toil and hard work. Huong and George have demonstrated a love for the Hydro's history, a passion for its future and a commitment and dedication to our region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hydro has emerged again as an important symbol of the Blue Mountains enduring spirit, breathtaking ambience and rich history that will attract increasing numbers of tourists each year. This launch communicates a resurgence of economic stimulus in the mountains to the wider Australian community. The opening of a world-class facility such as the Hydro Majestic reminds tourists that the Blue Mountains is a World Heritage area, that it is one of Australia's most spectacular icons, and that we are open for business. Treasurer Joe Hockey presided over the official opening, speaking to a large audience assembled in the Wintergarden, with its panoramic views of the Megalong Valley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer spoke to local economic stakeholders, business owners, chambers of commerce, residents of the Blue Mountains, and some very special guests. Descendants of the original ownersâMr Mark and Mrs Francis Foyâwere honoured at the event for representing the rich heritage presided over by their family. I wish to acknowledge the presence on the occasion of the Hon. Marise Payne, Minister for Human Services, who emceed the evening. Stuart Ayres, member for Penrith, Minister for Police and Emergency Services, Minister for Sport and Recreation, and Minister Assisting the Premier on Western Sydney, also attended the event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer described the Hydro Majestic as a six-star facility, declaring that it will bring to the mountains six-star tourists who want to buy the best wines and sample the best food. 'They're going to leave their money here in the Blue Mountains and create lots of jobs,' the Treasurer said. The Hydro Majestic is the largest hospitality employer in the Blue Mountains, with over 100 employees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer also stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To put $30 million into a magnificent property like this, not only to preserve the uniquely Australian culture of the early twentieth century, but also to celebrate what was protected and enhanced by Indigenous Australians for 40,000 yearsâthis is Australia's future, the opportunity to be the best in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer and I were guided through the Hydro Majestic's world-class facilities by George Saad, Huong Nguyen and General Manager Ralf Bruegger, touring the casino, Belgravia wing, ballroom, and the iconic Cat's Alleyânot seen by the public for many years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Owner Huong Nguyen, a dear friend to the Blue Mountains, said that the Hydro Majestic represents a private investment to preserve this treasured icon which inspires such nostalgia for the residents of the Blue Mountains. The risks of investing in such an ambitious project are enormous, and the transformation of the Hydro could not have come about without the dedication and sacrifice of local stakeholders. 'We have put an old icon back on the road map,' Huong said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  Before flying to Canberra yesterday evening I was very pleased to be able to spend the day in beautiful Diamond Creek in the Scullin electorate. I spent the day in the company of my great friend Vicki Ward, the newly elected state member for Eltham, and it was a pleasure, as ever, to be with her. Vicki had organised a group of people to participate in Clean Up Australia Day around the Challenger Street Reserve in Diamond Creek. I was very pleased that most of the work was done before I arrivedâgiving me very light dutiesâbut I was really interested to see how many people had come along to participate in this great initiative. I think it is significant that they were brought together by Vicki, because it is a testament to the way in which she engaged as the candidate for Eltham in the recent state election. Her capacity to bring together people in shared community purposes is something that was on display throughout the election campaign and also on Sunday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following Clean Up Australia Day, Vicki and I spent some time with the Diamond Creek Men's Shed. This an organisation that have been widely recognised in the Nillumbik and Scullin communities and, indeed, were awarded the 2014 Community Group of the year by the Shire of Nillumbik . It was a very interesting to see the facilities they have and discuss with the group their needs from state and federal governments. This is a group that have done so much for a community, whether it be connecting disengaged and at-risk youth to mentors or providing invaluable support to other community groups not only through the skills members have but also through the social involvement it has created for so many men, particularly older men, of course, in Diamond Creek and surrounds. They were the 2014 Community Group of the Year, recognised by the Shire of Nillumbik. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased also to acknowledge the 2014 Volunteer of the Year from that community, Ross Mendelsson of Wattle Glen, who has done so much work for his community, in particular as a volunteer driver for the council and other organisations. The work that Ron has done since retiring in 2012 is inspirational to me, and I am very pleased it was recognised by the council. The Australia Day honours also recognised two residents of Scullin from the City of Whittlesea. Kathy Lizio was awarded Senior Citizen of the Year. Her work in the Whittlesea U3A, in particular in bridging the digital divide for older residents of the City of Whittlesea, has been inspirational. At the other end of the spectrum, I acknowledge Rachael Davies, who was awarded Young Citizen of the Year. Rachel is only in year 11 at St Monicaâs College in Epping Year 11 but has done so much to address and advance the role and plight of asylum seekers and refugees, her mission being changing mindsets through raising awareness and advocacy. At this young age, Rachael is already a member of the Multifaith Multicultural Youth Network, providing advice to the Victorian government, and will be heading overseas to the United States to continue her work.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to be able to celebrate the wonderful work of volunteers in the Scullin electorate. There are those who have been appropriately recognised by councils, but I say to the many others who do great work that is yet to be recognised: we are aware of what you do for our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:339</span>):  I would like to take this opportunity today to commend the initiative shown by one of our local chambers of commerce in addressing the issue of vacant shop space in and around the heart of Beenleigh. The BeNew Beenleigh. Let Great Things Happen project is being run by the Beenleigh Yatala Chamber of Commerce. The newly established BeNew Beenleigh working committee are committed to finding short- and medium-term uses for buildings in Beenleigh's CBD that are currently vacant, disused or awaiting redevelopment. BeNew Beenleigh aim to find artists, entrepreneurs, cultural projects and community groups to use and maintain these buildings until they become commercially viable or are redeveloped.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The overall goal is to generate activity in the buildings and in the Beenleigh CBD to address the perception that Beenleigh is closed for business during the redevelopment project. The Beenleigh CBD is open for business. I would like to thank the efforts of the Beenleigh Yatala Chamber of Commerce President, Lawrie Dore, Vice President Anje Peiper, Treasurer Lisa Walker and Secretary Aydan Marriott for this initiative, and also committee members Kerry Armstrong, Neil Sanderson, Isaac Martinago, Leanne Taylor, Tony Hope, Stephen Johnson, James Herbst and, last but not least, Michael Rose. I would also like to thank the local business owners for their patience during the CBD upgrade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The project will transform the physical heart of the CBD into a place of cultural exchange and activity. I have been championing this project since I was first elected in 2010, and it is great to see this long-awaited project is now well underway thanks to a funding partnership between the government, the local city council, the Queensland government and Energex.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst on the topic of the Beenleigh CBD redevelopment, I recently toured the site with representatives from Logan City Council and the project managers, BMD. With the removal of the old infrastructure, the centre of town has now been expanded to make way for a spacious, new community hub. The undergrounding of electricity and other services is well underway, and construction of the intersection in the public realm is just around the corner. With weather permitting the project should be completed by September 2015. If you are planning to visit either Brisbane or the Gold Coast towards the end of the year, I would encourage you to take the time to stop and come and visit our newly developed CBDâjust 45 minutes from the Gold Coast airport and 30 minutes from Brisbane. Due to its ideal locationâbetween two international airportsâthe Beenleigh region has much to offer businesses and residents alike.</span>

Each of these groups is either based in or services the great electorate of Isaacs. I was joined by my federal parliamentary colleagues Clare O'Neil, the member for Hotham, and Alan Griffin, the member for Bruce. I was also joined by Hong Lim, the state member for Clarinda, and Councillor Sean O'Reilly, the mayor of the City of Greater Dandenong. Approximately 40 people representing eight different community groups attended the meeting. These eight community groups, though they all offer different and unique services to the residents of my electorate, have one thing in common: they have all had their federal funding under the community grants program slashed by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Springvale Benevolent Society provide food vouchers and blankets to disadvantaged and at-risk families across the City of Greater Dandenong. They have lost their entire $70,000 in annual federal funding and are likely to reduce their service by over 60 per cent. The Casey Cardinia Community Legal Service, which helps clients all across Melbourne's south-east, has lost nearly $90,000 of annual federal fundingâand that is on top of other cuts to legal aid funding. This $90,000 is a funding cut under the community grants program. I was told at the meeting that most of the Casey Cardinia legal services work is in family law, particularly in assisting women who have fled domestic violence to get their financial affairs in order and start again. This serviceâthat is, the financial advice serviceâis no longer offered. Dads in Distress Support Services, a national service that provides peer support to men experiencing family breakdown, have lost every cent of their federal funding. Dad's in Distress assist over 5,000 people each year and do not know how they will continue when their funding ends. It is a particular local concern in my electorate, because part of their service is based in Frankston.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are no other service providers in my electorate that can simply take over the role of these defunded community groups. These cuts target the most vulnerable in our community and will see residents of my electorate fall between the cracks. These cuts will see people go hungry, they will see families hurt and they will see basic needs go unmet. In a country like ours, that a government would make that happen is appalling. On behalf of the community groups of Isaacs that have been abandoned by this government, on behalf of their tireless volunteers and on behalf of the clients that need their services, I call on the minister to reassess his priorities and restore grant funding to community groups that provide essential community servicesâto restore funding that in many cases has been coming under this community grants program now for several decades. It must be restored. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  One thing our history has taught us over a long period of time is that many of the leftist, feel-good policies that are introduced by governments actually have many unintended consequences, and those unintended consequences actually cause more damage and more harm than the problem they were originally trying to solve. We have seen this with our border protection policies, where the previous government brought in policies they thought were compassionate but which actually caused the death of over 1,200 people, who died at sea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is well known, but I would like to explain, in the short time available, how the same thing happened with the carbon taxâhow it has actually cased death and disease in our society. To start with, a recent study by the Queensland University of Technology found that death rates in Australian cities were up to 30 per cent higher in winter than they were in summer. They also found there was no link between a hotter summer and higher deaths. It is the cold weather that causes death in our Australian cities, and the reason is that people have difficulty keeping themselves warm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to some recent figures released by the Australian Energy Regulator. They found that there was a 100 per cent increase in the number of New South Wales households that had their power cut off between 2009 and 2013. We know that the carbon tax and other so-called green environmental policies push up the price of electricity. As the price of electricity goes up, people simply cannot afford it. That is exactly what we have seen in New South Wales, where 33,000 households last year had their electricity cut off because of the carbon tax. We know that that must have caused those people a lot of hardship. If you live in a cold house during winter, when you cannot afford to warm your house, we know that leads to diseaseâand the Queensland University have confirmed that it leads to death.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other area where the carbon tax has detrimental adverse effects on people's health is the particulate matter. When people cannot afford electricity they look for alternates, and that is what has happened in Western Sydney. There has been a substantial increase in people burning wood. When you burn wood, you release particulate matter into the atmosphere, particularly what is called particulate matter PM2.5, and that is exactly what the monitoring stations in Western Sydney have recorded. They have recorded, during the period of the carbon tax, substantial increases in PM2.5 and PM2.10. In fact, in Western Sydney we now we have levels of PM2.10 that are higher than the World Health Organisation recommends. What does this do? It has been estimated that particulate matter has caused over 1,400 deaths in New South Wales. If we continue to increase electricity prices we will cause more death and disease in our states. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  I recently had the honour and the privilege to speak at the ceremony to rename ECCQ House as Nick Xynias House. Nick Xynias AO BEM was a co-founder of the ECCQ, which is something that his family is very proud of and rightfully proud of. He was the honorary president and volunteer chief executive officer of the ECCQâthe Ethnic Communities Council of Queenslandâright up until his recent death. Like everyone in our community, I was greatly saddened for the loss that his family suffered and that the organisation suffered. I was honoured to attend the funeral that the Greek Orthodox community held a few weeks ago for Mr Xynias. It was a beautiful service and a really fitting tribute to someone who had contributed so much to the cause of multiculturalism and diversity in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ECCQ, which also includes the Berlasco Court nursing home and Diversicare, is an organisation that since its establishment in 1976 has contributed greatly to multiculturalism in Queensland. Part of its mission is to ensure that people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds can participate fully in our communities. As an example of that, my friend the member for Brisbane and I recently addressed the leadership course that ECCQ runs for people in the community of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds who want to engage with politics, to be advocates and to be leaders. To be able to do that was a really wonderful opportunity. It shows just one example of the work that the ECCQ does in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nick's story in and of itself is a great example of the contribution of multiculturalism to our country. He was born to Greek parents in Egypt. He moved to Queensland in 1956 and was a very successfully businessman. On top of that, he and his wife Pat put a lot of work into building the cause of multiculturalism and community support in Queensland. I know that the chair of the ECCQ, Agnes Whitton OAM, deeply misses Nick and misses working with him. I saw her on Friday night at the dedication ceremony for the renaming of ECCQ House and expressed to her my condolences not just for the organisation's loss but also for the loss the entire committee suffered when they lost Nick. She said to me that Nick used to call her every morning. She said that she had received a call that morning, and she was so sad because, just for a second, she thought that maybe it was him, but then she remembered that he was gone. He helped so many people. He will be sorely missed, but his contribution to multiculturalism and to diversity in Queensland will live on for a very long time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  Last Friday there was a rally at the Repatriation General Hospital in my electorate. Six hundred to 700 people gathered to express their concern and outrage at the South Australian government's plan to shut down this iconic hospital. This was the last day of the state government's sham consultation. In early February, Premier Jay Weatherill launched his new health plan with great fanfare, calling it 'the biggest transformation to South Australia's health system we have undertaken'. How long did the state Labor government give the public and the medical community to comment on this important plan? Just 24 days. Contrast that with their next consultation, announced just two days afterward, on whether or not South Australia should change its time zone. Clearly, they believe it is much more important to hear what the public has to say on the time zone, because that consultation is still ongoing with no particular rush to finish. I am sure it is purely coincidence that, over those two days, when there was a massive public backlash over the state government's plan to close the repat, the time zone consultation is being run by Minister Hamilton-Smith, the only Minister for Veterans' Affairs ever to close a veterans hospital in his own electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The South Australian Labor government are now only listening to the advice they want to hear. Both the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation and the Australian Medical Association have said that their health plan lacks meaningful detail and they have not had a chance for proper consultation. Doctors and nurses in the public health system are being gagged from criticising their plan and banned from speaking out against changes they think will have a serious negative impact on South Australia's health system. I am aware of a number of staff at the repat who believe that shutting down this hospital is a terrible idea and will compromise patient care but do not want to be named because they have been put in fear for their jobs if they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things the health minister said is that other states no longer had a repat hospital. That is simply not true. New South Wales still has a repatriation hospital at Concord and the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital is part of the Austin Hospital in Victoria. I could go on. Last Friday, South Australians rallied at the repat to tell the state government what they think of their plan. Just because state Labor's consultation is officially over, that does not mean we are going to stop fighting to save the repat. If the doctors and nurses are not allowed to speak up for themselves, we, the Liberal Party of South Australia and residents of the southern suburbs, will speak up for them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  This coming Friday, 6 March, a midnight pyjama-party protest is being organised in Perth by a group of activists protesting the planned closure of the late-night train services on the Perth rail network. The 1:15 am and 2:15 am services are important to thousands of people, particularly young people, who want to enjoy the big city and Northbridge at night and take part in what is an increasingly important part of our economy, the night-time economy. By taking away these services, many young people are going to be denied the opportunity to really participate in the night-life of the city and to be part of that buzz of the big city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite frankly, the cost and availability of cabs, particularly for those people living in outer suburbs, really precludes them as a meaningful alternative. I find it quite extraordinary that the Premier, who is constantly pontificating about how he is getting rid of Perth's 'dullsville' tag, should be moving down such a path. I think it shows a fundamental misunderstanding of and lack of engagement with the lives of young people and the lives of people that live in the outer suburbs and, of course, a disengagement with the whole exercise of public transport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has constantly put out misinformation about the serviceâfirst of all saying that it was free and then saying that some of the trains were averaging 20 to 30 people. The Minister for Transport was then forced to acknowledge that he got that wrong, that the trains were not free and that the averages indeed had been calculated by including the nil passenger trips back to the depotâso, quite clearly, an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of our community. But people were not deceived, and I want to congratulate Luke Pickersgill and Georgia Blackburn for their great online campaign, which to date has got 13,000 RSVPs to the big pyjama party at Perth train station next week. It is great to see community activism out there and great to see people coming out in support of public transport.</span>

This is the heart of my electorate of Capricornia. It has been 10 days since the impact and people continue to suffer badly. Along with ordinary households, small business and primary producers have also suffered dreadful losses of stock, infrastructure and the ability to earn an income. This is in turn impacts on workers, whose jobs in these industries are now at risk. On the ground, I recognise that people have become angry that they are finding it too difficult to meet the criteria for financial help. People are queuing in long lines in the hot sun outside recovery hubs to register for financial assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are working on this at the highest levels of government to help. The Prime Minister visited Yeppoon and Rockhampton on Thursday and Friday. He walked down Ben Street, one of those badly hit in Yeppoon. He spoke to local residentsâlistening first hand to their traumatic stories and the huge road to recovery they now face. The Prime Minister also attended a BBQ with volunteers and emergency work crews, who are working hard to help our community recover. Joining the Prime Minister was the federal Minister for Justice, overseeing natural disaster assistance, and the federal Minister for Human Services as well as the chief of the Australian Defence Force. The Prime Minister announced additional assistance to help people who cannot go to work and earn an income to feed their families because their workplace has been shut down due to the impact of the cyclone. Those eligible can now apply to access 13 weeks of Newstart payments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The agriculture minister visited the Capricorn Coast on Saturday. We met with farmers who grow mangoes, lychees, avocados, citrus, pineapples, sweet potato and macadamias, as well as the plant nurseries and those in the dairy and timber industries. Like many, macadamia grower Errol Vass, has lost a $200,000 nut crop and 2,000 trees. These trees were 48-years old and their production value was priceless. He estimates it would take 15 years to rebuild. The Marsh family at Boundary Nursery near Byfield report losses over $1 million and counting. The minister and I listened closely, and we have returned to Canberra with a list of suggestions to help our agricultural industries and small business owners to get back on their feet. I will continue to keep the House informed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HWQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MARLES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  I rise today to speak about health care, a service which means so much for so many in Australia. From paediatrics to palliative care, a quality health system equipped to meet the complex demands of the future is critical to the quality of life in this country. A quality healthcare system is not something which a region and, indeed, the nation can simply procure but a product of making the right decisions today to secure quality healthcare for tomorrow. In facing this challenge we too often see this Liberal government fail to make those decisions and fail to make the critical investments to ensure the appropriate skills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Corio, the region's largest health services provider, Barwon Health, are experiencing this precise concern. At present, their Pain Management Unit at University Hospital, Geelong, accommodates one senior trainee under the Specialist Training Program for the Pain Management Unit. The existence of this senior trainee position not only enabled the unit to increase the breadth and intensity of services delivered but also has made an important contribution to addressing the concerning skills shortages for medical specialists. In recent years, the Pain Management Unit has successfully trained 10 specialists. That is 10 specialists that would not be in the health workforce without participating in the Specialist Training Program in the Pain Management Unit. Three of these specialists have continued to work in the Geelong region providing health services to those who suffer from significant pain. Despite this vital success, the Abbott government has refused to provide any certainty that the specialist training program will continue to receive adequate funding beyond October this year. Indeed, currently there are 900 Specialist Training Program funded positions across Australia which are now at risk if funding is cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the Abbott government have already demonstrated they cannot be trusted to support proper planning for the future health workforce, demonstrated by their scrapping of Health Workforce Australiaâa complementary initiative established under the former Labor government. As modern medicine continually evolves, we are constantly reminded of the importance of persistently building specialist skills across our health sector. The work of the Barwon Health Pain Management Unit exemplifies precisely this. By successfully developing expertise in acute pain, cancer pain, palliative services and chronic pain the unit can most effectively treat the range of illnesses for which a patient may require the services of the hospital. It is through this concentration of this complementary expertise that the unit is able to provide such a high quality of serviceâa service which reduces the suffering of many and can provide them with a hope of restoring a healthier life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be supporting our aspiring medical specialists. We need to be able to have genuine confidence that our healthcare system will be equipped to deliver for the challenges of tomorrow. We need to be creating more of these success stories, not less.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="148150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  I rise today to speak on a very topical and important subject around food labelling, an issue which has been in the press recently, which is of great concern to the people in my electorate and of course to the incredible amount of local manufacturers who produce food for this nation. It has been identified that a number of hepatitis A cases have resulted through the purchase of overseas food products which were packaged and delivered into this country. Certainly, if you look at the comments on places like social media, you see that the electorate is overwhelming in support of clear truth in labelling for Australian produced productsâthings that are manufactured and grown in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Rowan Ramsey, the chair of the agricultural committee, who put out a very timely report just before Christmas, and ministers Joyce, Macfarlane, Billson and Nash who have been tasked with identifying a way to address this issue and to act in the very short-term. I went to a meeting last week where they asked for us as backbenchers to provide information as soon as possible. We have a one-week timeframe to get feedback from our electorates. So I was very pleased to be able to talk to some major food manufacturers inside my electorate, including places like Bundaberg Brewed Drinksâwhich of course is owned by the Fleming family, a world famous manufacturer and former Queensland exporter of the year; Macadamias Australia and the Steinhart family, which produces wonderful products such as chocolate coated macadamias for export and the local market; and Austchilli, owned by the De Paoli family, who provide products including things like AvoFreshâa well-known product available locally and made predominately from local products.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, not everyone agrees all time, but the overwhelming majority of the manufacturers I spoke toâand there were far more than just the ones that I have namedâwere in support of truth in labelling, such as a simple pictogram; something which identifies exactly where the food is sourced from, where it is manufactured and where it is produced. On the condition of anonymity, a number of other producers that I spoke to were very quick to lay the blame at the feet of the duopoly, saying that Coles and Woolworths are almost solely responsible for the position we find ourselves in. It is quite simply a disgrace that they have forced our local producers off the market by predatory practicesâand, of course, they have a lot form in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that they are using overseas products is that they simply cannot meet the incredibly strong demands from Coles and Woolworths for very low-price product and many of them have gone out of the market. I could give you countless examples of very large farmers who have fallen over due to these practices, including in places like SP Exports in the Childers location. They employed some 600 people who are now no longer with us. It is incredibly unfortunate. I look forward to being able to put together the feedback from people in my electorate to get that submission to the taskforce. I look forward to us taking direct action in the short term. The time for inquiries has finished. We do not need more reports; we just need to act.</span>

In Australia, we have made progress in implementing the Beijing Platformâand so we should, I might addâand in recent years have made a number of significant achievements, as outlined in our most recent report to the United Nations. Labor's introduction of an affordable national paid parental leave scheme in 2011 has assisted more than 400,000 families to balance family, caring and work roles and allowed women to take time off work to care for their child.</span>

These engagements with women from across the Pacific provide renewed impetus for meâand I hope this parliamentâto ensure that Australia continues to take a lead role in our region to promote gender equality, opportunity and safety for women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2010, the former Labor government introduced a 12-year framework to address Australia's commitment to upholding the human rights of women and to bring together the nation to achieve a significant and sustained reduction in the levels of violence against women. I note that the current government have continued the implementation of the plan, and I commend them for doing so, although I share the very real concerns raised by Australian of the Year, Rosie Batty, about the negative impact of cuts to government funding and front-line support services for women and children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, on average one woman is killed every week as a result of intimate partner violence, and it is most likely to occur in her home. In Indigenous communities, the statistics are at their worst, with Aboriginal women 34 times more likely to be hospitalised for violent assault than non-Indigenous women, and 10 times more likely to die as a result of family violence. These are shocking statistics for a wealthy and developed nation like Australia. No nation can afford to have so many of its citizens left in such dangerous and vulnerable circumstances to fend for themselves. We must make a more concerted effort on a national level to address these issues. No woman or child should feel unsafe in their own home, anywhere or anytime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to draw attention to the issue of inequality in the workplace. The Workplace Gender Equality Agency was established in 2012 to promote and improve gender equality in Australian workplaces. Australia remains a nation where women are paid less for the work they do, do more unpaid work, are denied seats at the heads of the largest corporationsâand in this place too, I might addâare more stressed and are more likely to be victims of workplace harassment. As reported last week, our gender pay gap has blown out to a record high, stretching to 18.8 per cent. What was the government's response to this inequality in the workplace? It was a watering down of the gender reporting guidelines for businesses, as announced last week. I call on the 'Prime Minister for women' and his government to reconsider their position in light of the shocking state of the gender pay equity gap in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As outlined in the motion before the House today, International Women's Day is a time to reflect. If we are serious about gender inequality, we must confront the stark reality that we need to do much more. I look forward to celebrating International Women's Day with colleagues and organisations in Canberra this week and, on return to my electorate of Newcastle, I will celebrate with the Union of Australian Women at their annual dinner with special guest speaker Helen Cummings, a longstanding activist and advocate against violence towards women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I finish with some words delivered by our first woman Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, who reflected on inequality at an event just last week:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="241589" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McNAMARA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  I thank the member for Newcastle for moving this motion and join her in celebrating International Women's Day. This Sunday, 8 March, people across the world will celebrate International Women's Day. It is a day to celebrate the economic, political and social achievements of women. It is also an opportunity to reflect upon how far women have come in their struggle for equality, peace and development. This year's theme is 'Make it Happen', through which we are encouraged to celebrate women's achievements and to call for greater equality between the genders. This year, 2015, marks the 20th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, which was held Beijing and where the Beijing Platform for Action, a progressive blueprint for advancing women's rights, was launched 20 years ago. At this conference, 20 years ago, a number of critical aspects of women's rights were raised, and today many of these aspects still require significant action to address and achieve equality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, the greatest inequality against women is violence. Efforts to protect the human rights of women and girls have not been as successful as they need to be. It is inexcusable that in a country as advanced as ours on average every week a woman is killed by a current or former partner and one in three women over the age of 15 experience physical violence in their lifetime. Last week I spoke in parliament about the shocking and saddening statistic that the electorate of Dobell exhibits the second highest rate of domestic and family violence in New South Wales. It is my responsibility as an elected member of parliament to ensure that the voiceless are given a voice and that this inequality and injustice is stamped out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcomed the Prime Minister's announcement earlier this year that the problem of violence against women at a national level has been placed on the COAG agenda and that an advisory panel on violence against women has been established. Last year the government launched the Second Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. This plan outlines a whole-of-community approach to prevent violence against women and children in our society. International Women's Day provides a united voice to stand up and speak out against such inequalities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another notable inequality is equal opportunity for women in the economy. I welcome the bipartisan approach taken by this parliament to increase women's workforce participation and improve gender equality in the workplace. In 2014, the World Economic Forum ranked Australia 24th out of 142 nations on its Global Gender Gap Report, with Australia having slipped from 15th in 2006. Disappointingly, Australia ranked 51st for women's labour force participation and 63rd for wage equality for similar work. However, it is not all bad news. There are encouraging statistics that come from this report. Australia ranked equal first for educational attainment, literacy rates and enrolment in primary, secondary and tertiary education. This is an area where we are leading the world, and we have an opportunity to play a significant role in lifting the educational standards for women in developing nations. Increasing access to education empowers women in many ways. Education is a ticket to a brighter future, a job and self-sufficiency. Together we can lift many women out of poverty and empower them to lead their own independent lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Twenty years ago the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing aimed to ensure women's full participation in decision-making, an increased role for women in the media and the end of gender stereotypes. It is important that we encourage women to partake in decision-making roles. But I strongly support the view that this should be achieved by encouraging, mentoring and supporting capable women based upon merit and capacity. Be it in parliament, in the boardroom or in senior executive positions, we have no shortage of amazing, talented women capable of conducting these roles. Today, and indeed every day, we should ensure that we are mentoring and encouraging women and making it clear that they have a right to succeed in roles which have historically been male dominated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be the first female elected to represent the people of Dobell. In 2015, it is difficult to envisage an Australia where women did not have the right to vote. It took until 1911 for all Australian jurisdictions to allow women the vote. Sadly, the freedom of having your own say in politics is a basic right not shared by many women around the world. All members of parliament are leaders in our local community, and we have a responsibility to champion the cause of gender equality. I again commend the member for Newcastle for this motion and restate my commitment to support gender equality in my electorate here in parliament. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  I, too, am very pleased to rise to support this motion by the member for Newcastle. I commend her for moving this motion and I acknowledge the previous speakers as well. I, too, note that International Women's Day will be celebrated globally on Sunday, 8 March 2015. It is a day to celebrate the economic, political and social achievements of women and to review how far women have come in the struggle for equality, peace and development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On International Women's Day we honour women locally and from all corners of the globe for the unique contributions that they make. These contributions are equally important and wide ranging through so many different and diverse areas. In 2015 we also reflect on the Beijing Platform for Actionâa very progressive blueprint for advancing women's rights launched 20 years ago. It is amazing to think it was 20 years ago that it was launched at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. At that particular conference, 17,000 participants and 30,000 activists went to Beijing for the opening in September 1995. They were an incredibly diverse and wide-ranging group coming from all around the globe. But they had a single purpose in mind, and that was about the empowerment of all women and gender equality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The conference produced the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Actionâthe most progressive blueprint ever for advancing women's rights. Indeed, the Platform for Action put forth a world where each women and girl can exercise her freedoms and choices and realises her rightsâreally important rights, such as being able to attend school and being able to earn equal pay for equal work. Hillary Clinton led the US delegation to China in 1995 and delivered a now famous speech on the treatment of women around the world. Twenty years ago in that speech she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are womenâs rights and womenâs rights are human rights once and for all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 20th anniversary of Beijing opens new opportunities to reflect and generate interest and political will in the advancing of the opportunities and challenges that women face worldwide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone has an important role to play in progressing women's rights for our common good, for everybody. The evidence increasingly shows that the empowering of women empowers and strengthens communities, economies grow faster and families are healthier and much better educated. Women today occupy many leadership positions in our local community and in the business world, as well as performing vital roles in both the paid and unpaid workforce. I would like to pay tribute to all those women I know in my community who make a difference to the lives of so many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we have achieved so much, there are still so many challenges that remain. Many of those issues first raised at the conference require significant action to address them. Despite continued institutional and societal reform to promote women within our communities and to protect their basic rights, women in many areas have been disadvantaged. There are still so many areas that need improvement. Women still disproportionately suffer from poverty and violence in our community. Pay and gender inequality is still a major concern. There must be greater access to health and education and, indeed, there must be greater protection of the human rights of women and girls around the world </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that a quality education benefits everyoneâwomen and men. Quality is best achieved when we all work together. I am so proud to be a member of the Labor Party, which has always striven to promote the rights of women. We have introduced some policies that have really benefited women, such as the age pension, universal health care through Medicare, no-fault divorce and single parents pension, a paid parental leave scheme, changes to the Fair Work Act to provide greater equality and a national plan to reduce violence against women. We have also increased funding to increase access to education, particularly university education, providing greater employment opportunities for women. I am very proud of that record. Improving women's economic security and fighting to ensure women's equal place in society are very important goals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to congratulate the many groups in my electorate who really strive to improve conditions for women. Whether they are community groups, business groups, support groups or friendship groups, they play a vital role. Many of the emergency support groups play such an important role, but lately many of those important support services have had their funding cut by Liberal-National state and federal governments. It means that many women, particularly those fleeing from domestic violence, are not able to access the services that they and their children desperately need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know from my time as a former police officer how important these services are. The cuts to front-line services, including both community services at a federal level and domestic violence services at a state level, have devastating effects on many communities. Make no mistake: these are bad decisions by bad governments, just like their cruel cuts to health and education. The fact is investing in women and girls is good for societies and good for the future prosperity of countries. On International Women's Day we all have to recommit ourselves to a future of equality so together we can ensure that people everywhere have an opportunity to live up to their potential. In 2015, as we reflect on the Beijing Platform for Action designed 20 years ago, let us focus on advancing women's rights worldwide. Have a wonderful and inspiring International Women's Day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  I want to commend the member for Newcastle and the member for Dobell for bringing forward this motion to celebrate International Women's Day and add my voice as a man in support of these worthy objectives that are in the International Women's Day platform, the Beijing Platform for Action. Men have a critical role to play in so many of these areas and so many of these facets, including combatting violence against women, ending stereotypes and ensuring that women have a role to play in the economy. It is very important men speak up as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a young person in the parliament, growing up in Australia today, I still find it completely unbelievable that we have pay that is unequal for women, that we do not have the same pay for the same work, based on gender. It is a violation of individual rights, it is a violation of human rights and it is certainly something that we need to see action on within our societyâthat there is no discrimination based on gender at any level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to say that mainly the government is focused on domestic violence at the moment, and I think this is perhaps where men have the most critical role to play. We know for a fact in international circles that in conflict, or where there is violence in countries around the world, it is often women or girls who bear the brunt of this awful tragedy and awful violence and it is completely unacceptable. But also within our own country, and within Western democracies, there is a hidden scourge of domestic violence. That is why it is so important that Australia recently launched its Second Action Plan, moving ahead with the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children. This will unite the Australian community to make a significant and sustained reduction in the levels of violence against women and their children. Nothing can be so important, especially when we are celebrating this important achievement in international women's affairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate, we have the start of a new foundation to end domestic violence, a very important foundation, the Lisa Harnum Foundation. People in Sydney were gripped by the shocking and awful incident involving Lisa Harnum, who was murdered and died tragically when her then fiance, Simon Gittany, threw her from the 15th floor balcony. This really galvanised attitudes in Sydney against domestic violence and hardened people's approach, encouraging men everywhere to stand up against violence against women and other men. Lisa's mother has given permission for this foundation to be established.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aileen Mountfield, who is setting up this foundation, is looking at new technologies and ways of dealing with domestic violence, allowing women who are in difficult situations to reach for help when they are usually unable to reach for help. As we know from police and other services, women in these very difficult environments with abusive partners, or men who have them under their thumb, are unable to reach out for help or access that help. So the Lisa Harnum Foundation is looking at very advanced waysâways that we do not discuss in public because they are hiddenâof allowing women to access those services. This is really a step forward and I think that is a great tribute to Lisa Harnum and her life and her story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth has a zero-tolerance approach not just to domestic violence but to issues such as female genital mutilation. We also have a zero-tolerance approach to the marrying of young girls within our own society. This is something we have unfortunately seen, even in Sydney in recent times. Some cultures think it is still acceptable today for an older male to, by force, marry an under-age girl against her willâwithin our own society. It occurs even to the extent where girls have been forcibly taken from Australia and sent to other countries. This is completely unacceptable as well and something that I think all of us as Australians need to take a stand on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014 Australia released its first progress report on the Australian National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security 2012-18. The national action plan is part of Australia's commitment to integrate a gender perspective into peace and security efforts, protect the human rights of women and girls and promote women's participation in conflict prevention, management and resolution. The first progress report shows that we are tracking well. But there is a lot to do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear every day from women in difficult situations in all of our electorates all around the country that violence against women continues at unacceptable levels and in unacceptable ways. Australia is absolutely committed and focused on partnering and supporting all of these efforts, including motions like this in the parliament today, and doing whatever we can to recognise that we face serious challenges, recognising that men have an equal and important role in delivering better outcomes for women and ensuring their individual and human rights are respected. I absolutely endorse and commend this motion to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="30540" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRODTMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak about International Women's Day. As have others have, I commend the member for Newcastle for her motion. I also commend the speakers who have been in advance of me. All the speeches have been wonderful. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I enjoyed kicking off this International Women's Day week this morning with a breakfast with the Speaker and MPs from Fiji. Our Speaker hosted a breakfast and it was really wonderful to hear about what is happening in Fiji, to hear the progress that they are making. Unfortunately, only 16 per cent of Fiji's parliament is comprised of women. But they have achieved that so far, so let us hope that they will get to 50 per cent in the very near future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">International Women's Day is a celebration of the great achievements of women throughout the world and throughout our history, from women's suffrage to reproductive rights. It is because of the work of giants of women that has taken place in the past that I am able to stand in this chamber and speak today. In this place, I carry the dreams, the work and the sacrifice of other women and I want to thank them. At the time of our Federation, it would have been novel, perhaps inconceivable, that women would stand in this great chamber. It is thanks to many famous, and not so famous, women that I can be here, that we women can be here today. It is also thanks to my working-class matriarchy that I can be here today. It is thanks to my great-grandmother, my grandmother and my mother. It is because of their hard-headed determination and that of others like them that I have been able to run a successful business, sit on boards and be elected to parliament. I want to thank them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we have much to celebrate, there is so much more that has to be done. We must continue to fight for equal pay. Australian women are earning less today than they ever have before, when compared with their male colleagues. According to ABS data from August last year, the gender pay gap has soared to above 18 per cent. The data show that male salaries have increased by 2.9 per cent over the past year while, alarmingly, women's salaries have only gone up by 1.9 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also fight to improve the representation of women on boards and in the parliament. Research shows that improving diversity on boards, including increasing the number of women, has a positive impact on the performance of an organisation. I have witnessed this firsthand through the boards I have been a member of, both at the commercial level and at the not-for-profit level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also continue to fight to end violence against women. Violence against women in Australia is a deep-rooted cultural problem; and it is shocking. One in three women in Australia has experienced physical violence, almost one in five has been subjected to sexual assault and one woman is killed by her partner or former partner every week. We have to have a zero tolerance approach and we need to call out family violence when we see it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to ensure that women have the financial literacy to plan for a comfortable retirement. I often speak with women, many of whom are in the private rental market, are on low incomes and have very limited superannuation. They are facing a bleak retirement. I am worried that too many women have not planned for their future beyond work. I am worried that too many people do not have a plan for their retirement. Since I was elected, I have spoken on many occasions to women and encouraged them to understand how much superannuation they have so they can work out how much they need for their retirement and how much they need to put away each week. Understanding the detail of what they need for their retirement will allow them to better plan for their futures. And as I say to young women all the time, 'A man is not a financial plan.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we must work to protect the human rights of all women and girls all around the world. In Afghanistan, we are experiencing a transition at the moment. I am very concerned that the hard-fought-for gains that have been made by the international community, involving the loss of life of many in the international community, will erode, evaporate and amount to nought. I am very concerned that women need to be around the table in the discussions with both the Taliban and the government to ensure that they have a say when they do transition to a post-international community environment. More women need to be sitting around the table negotiating on their futures in Afghanistan, not setting the table, and we need to ensure that those women do not end up being dinner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have come a long way in the last 100 years, but our achievements have barely touched many women in developing countries like Afghanistan, where female literacy is still very, very low in many provinces and female and infant mortality is still extraordinarily high. We still need to fight to ensure equal rights and equal opportunities are shared by all our sisters throughout the world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  I stand today to support the honourable member for Newcastle's motion on International Women's Day, which falls on 8 MarchâSunday of this week. I also support statements made by the Hon Julie Bishop:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">On International Women's Day we should take the opportunity to reflect on women's achievements and the challenges they continue to face.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western Australia, the first International Women's Day gathering was a public meeting held on 8 March 1938 at the Perth Town Hall. The topic was 'International women of note: their contribution to present day problems.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 77 years since 1938, International Women's Day has been celebrated each year in Western Australia in one form or another. Over the decades, different types of events and different themes have reflected the shifting priorities of the women in our changing world. In 2015, the theme for International Women's Day is 'Standing together for change'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I am standing together as an equal with the women in my electorate of Hasluck, so I will introduce them to you statistically. In Hasluck, just over 75,000 women completed the census in 2011, making up 50.2 per cent of the population. Of those women, Aboriginal women represented 2.7 per cent. It is interesting to note that 31.3 per cent of women in Hasluck were born overseas. The top five countries of birth for women born overseas were the United Kingdom, New Zealand, India, the Philippines and Malaysiaâall very different and diverse. Eighty-one per cent of women spoke only English at home. Fifty per cent of women who are 15 or older are in the labour force, compared to 67 per cent of men. Twenty nine per cent of women in my electorate are undertaking education from pre-primary and primary to tertiary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand together with the women of Hasluck for increased education and labour force participation. Equally, I stand together with the female members of this parliament whose state of origin is Western Australia: foreign minister, the Hon. Julie Bishop; the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women, Senator Michaelia Cash; and coalition whip, the Hon. Nola Marino. All of them have taken strong stances on the need to consider where women have key and significant roles, and ensure they are in the same equal vein of consideration as we give in a disproportionate manner to men. Women represented 49.7 per cent of the total population in WA at the date of the last census in 2011, but they are not 49 per cent of its parliamentarians. I stand together with women in this parliament for higher representation, and to improve the plight of women all around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year I became an ambassador for White Ribbon, which is the male-led campaign to end men's violence against women. In Australia, family violence is the principle cause of homelessness for women and their children. I swore the White Ribbon oath on 25 November 2014: never to commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women. I stand together with the 159,000 Australians who have already sworn the same oath. What is important is that in the discussions around our tables, the boardrooms, the places where we work or in any site that we live in or share within this community of ours, that we develop the capacity of our society to grow the opportunity to focus on women being equals in all aspects of all things that we do, both in economic advancement and in their opportunitiesâthey should never be negated. Things also need to happen at the dinner table, where a daughter is equal to a son, where a father or a husband is equal to his wife, and where our attitude and our words do not distinguish between either.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The message is simple. We are equal and we are together. I am proud to contribute to this debate today, and I am proud to be standing with my fellow parliamentarians for change ahead of International Women's Day on Sunday. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Townsville is a fantastic city. What we did recently with the announcement of Townsville's international airport goes to a couple of things that I want to talk about here. First and foremost it says that the government does not create wealth. Government sets the circumstances around which business can employ and business can create wealth. What we have done here is allow the market to decide if Townsville can sustain an international airportâand not government red tape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This decision says two things about our government. First, it says that the government, under the leadership of Tony Abbott and Warren Truss, acknowledges that money is tight. Even though our department of immigration and border control has saved us billions and billions of dollars by stopping the boats, their budget is always under pressure. This decision to allow Townsville to recommence being an international airport was not a specific election promise. The money had to be found. Minister Scott Morrisonâwhen he had the jobâand now Peter Dutton above all respect the taxpayers' dollars. We had to earn it. This is a government which does not drive down the street throwing $50 notes out of the windows.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, it says that, if you have a good idea, we are open for business. Not one minister turned me away. The PMO has been fantastic in assisting me get this up. It would not have happened without the cooperation of the ministers in charge of border control, Treasury, trade and investment, finance, and infrastructure, and without the PMO playing a crucial role in pulling it all together. I could not be prouder of my leadership team or of being a member of this government representing a city which wants to do more for its citizens each and every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the last election and ever since I was elected, I have always said that Townsville has to be an international city, if we are going to develop the north of Australia. The largest city north of the Tropic of Capricornâacross the countryâis Townsville. We have nearly 200,000 people. We have a fine university base. We have a diversified economy. Townsville is a national hub for this. We must be an international city. We cannot simply look west to the North West Mineral Province and hope for our future. Where is our region? Our region faces the north, the east, the west and the north-west. We are perfectly positioned for the Asian century. We are perfectly positioned to be that conduit and that hub for the development of northern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have always said that if you draw a right angle triangle using Townsville as the hub, as the axis point there, you have Papua New Guinea to the north of us and Fiji to the east of us. In that 90 degree arc of a circle you have the Melanesian world. That is where a large percentage of our aid goes, and it is a large area of concern for Australia. It is somewhere Townsville has a very serious role to play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Townsville we do not necessarily talk so much about tourism; we talk about visitation. We do not care why you are coming to Townsville. We do not care if you are coming to Townsville to get a tooth pulled. You come to Townsville and you stay a night and you spend a night in a restaurant. We get your investment in our community that way. If we look at our region and you look at places like Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Fiji and all the way round that Melanesian world, Townsville can be that hub when it comes to training, vocational education and training. We have our university. We have our health sector, with the fantastic Townsville hospital, which can play a role in that region. We simply cannot continue to look to the North West Mineral Province west at Mt Isa as the future for our country. What we must do is open up these new markets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Townsville airport came up with the idea and they actively chased and chased and chased. It got Jetstar and AirAsia interested in international flights. That was our point of differentiation. We had to make sure that we had a plan, that we were not just chasing a tick and a flick and that we had someone who wanted to do it. There is more work to be done, but the people at Townsville Airport Ltd like Kevin Gill and Isabelle Yates have, since before the last election in 2013, been non-stop in trying to make sure that we dot our i's and cross our t's. We have spoken extensively with the Sunshine Coast Airport about the way they have managed it with flights to New Zealand. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue here is about cost recovery. The issue here is that, although we have customs and immigration people based at our port in Townsville, they are working full time and the airport is too far away to get them to come over for intermittent flights. So the federal government has had to come to the party and say, 'If it becomes prohibitive when you are talking about a discount route, if the costs for ground control'âto quote David Bowieâ'are more than the costs in the air, it simply becomes non-commercial and you will fail.' Townville has failed in that regard before, when it had Strategic Airlines doing flights to Bali. What the federal government has done is come in and said, 'We will back Townsville to make sure that you are in a competitive space.' It is not just Townsville Airport that has pushed for this. We as a city have pushed for this. There are people from Townsville Enterprise, including David Kippin, Trish O'Callaghan and Tracey Lines Lyons, who have been non-stop in their support of this. It is the thing that has brought our city and our region together. Townsville<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s Chamber of Commerce has been right behind us, all the way through. They have been as supportive as they possibly can. Our point of differentiation is that we are the hub for Northern Australia. We are the ones who have airlines that want to do business there. We have pitched the idea to our northern mayors. We have the support of government. And no<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">-</span>one can say that we cannot do this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has not been easy and there is still more work to do. We must look at these things on a cost-recovery basis. Eventually Townsville must become a stand-alone international airport. We cannot continually put our hand out and ensure that we will get these things. Again, I must come back to that basic point when Tony Abbott stood up on 7 September 2013 and said: 'Australia is open for business.' What this decision has done for Townsville is reinforce that position: business is open. We are capable of doing this. I have had northern mayors such as Jenny Hill, Roger Bow, Bill Lowis from the Burdekin, Alf Lacey from Palm Island and Frank Beveridge from Charters Towers come down here for meetings. At every stage during those meetings, including with Joe Hockey, Andrew Robb and Mathias Cormann and Warren Truss<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s officeâall the people involved in this decisionâit has been: where to from here? At every stage it has been: what can we do to help you in this space? Yes, money is tight. And, yes, everyone comes down here with their hand out. But we had a plan and we stuck to it. Those are the big things for Townsville. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From here it goes to: where to next? We do have flights that are booked. We have an airline that is ready to go. Townsville must continue to grow. We must develop our airport hub, with a particular emphasis to build on businesses like Flying Colours Aviation, which do respraying of aircraft. They could have set up anywhere in the world, but they chose to set up in Townsville. We can be a mighty power when it comes to turbo prop services support in our region. The Townsville Airport must make sure that we continue to push forward. We will have a city with a mayor, the Chamber of Commerce and the Townsville Enterprise right behind us in that regard. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have three new state members who must get their head around what has got to happen in this space. We also have a federal member who is very keen to ensure that we keep pushing forward. Like I said, the big thing about this issue is that we recognise that we have made a good startâbut it is just a start. No<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">-</span>oneâbe it Townsville Airport, the Townsville Enterprise, the Chamber of Commerce or meâis saying that this is 'mission accomplished'. What we are saying is that it is step 1 for the growth of Townsville. If we are to develop the north of Australia, if we are to be its hub, then Townsville must be front and centre in that space. We are the biggest city in this space. We are an important regional city centre. We have a university, an army base, a diversified economy and a great portâand so an airport is essential. For us to be able to push through in that space means that we will be able to develop our industries, provide that income and be able to bring our regional incomes, our regional mayors, into Townsville to make sure that we understand what they are chasing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Andrew Robb has often said that the projects are out there but we must lift our eyes beyond the obvious and look for the things which can be built. If we can do that, if we can attract the interest, if we can chase those big projects and get the private income that goes with it, we will be able to sustain this development all the way through. That is something we take very seriously, and something we should as a parliament take very seriously. Andrew Robb and Tony Abbott have both said that Northern Australia is not the last frontier; it is the next frontier. We will never be the food bowl of Asia, and I think Barnaby Joyce is 100 per cent correct on that. What we will do is service niche markets. We will service them with product, with quality and with assurance when it comes to product certainty, and we will be able to play in that space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision around Townsville airport is the first one we have been about to get through and it something about which the whole city and the region should take great pride. It shows that we are a government that is open for business and open for ideas. I thank the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  Yes, I second the motion. We are obviously pleased to see this development take place in Townsville, and there is a great deal of bipartisanship about that particular project. But I do have to say that, in discussion of northern development, I think we need to clearer eyed. As has often been said, there has been a great deal of perhaps intellectual adventurism that has gone on in our discussion of northern Australia which has really not brought home the bacon. There has perhaps been too much emphasis on the grand and the big project as the thing that is going to turn around the future of northern Australia, and that has resulted in nowhere near the development that perhaps could have taken place. We need to move away from some of the more grandiose projects towards some more fine grain understanding of the environment and the population with whom we are dealing and come up with a response to northern Australia that may be less conducive to the grand press release but is far more conducive to sustainable development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that northern Australia is, as said recently by a couple of authors in the conversationâAndrew Campbell and Jim Turnerâa very special part of the world. It has amazing heritage and values. Yes, there is enormous scope for development, but the focus on dam building and big infrastructure interventions is not really the way that is going to develop this.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms MacTIERNAN:</span>
                  </a>  I am more than happy to talk about that but, as I said, it has to be an intelligent conversation. The CSIRO have some very interesting things to say about that. For example, they estimate that through investment in genetics and technological innovation and science around forage quality, nutrition and growth the productivity rate for the beef industry can be increased by 40 per cent to 50 per cent. Having a group of scientists from the CSIRO beavering away doing the research, getting the quality of the product and finding out how we match the soils in the northern region with the sustainable availability of water is not quite as glamourous but it is indeed what is going to bring home the bacon more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western Australia, we are not saying that it is all agricultureâthough I was very pleased to see that we have a bipartisan or tripartisan view on the point that northern Australia will not be the food bowl of Asiaâbut there is certainly enormous opportunity to develop our agricultural product. The CSIRO contribution here that we could get a 40 to 50 per cent increase in our beef productivity is very worthwhile. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to be looking at more vertical integration. In the Kimberley, we see extraordinary work being done in places like Kilto Station, Yeeda Station and Fossil Downs Station. They are finding out where their good soils are, where the sustainable water supply is and, without giant damming systems, are able to provide a level of forage quality that sees that they can turn off finished-off cattleâcattle that can be slaughtered at abattoirs that are currently being built out of Broome. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We note that there are abattoir programs across the top of Australia. We can get more value-add from our beef products. We can create more jobs for the communities up there, particularly the Indigenous communities. These are jobs which they have expressed great interest in and which help them develop their assets in the north of Australia. We need to consider the Indigenous population in the north. In Western Australia, the Indigenous population is 40 per cent in the Kimberley and 12 per cent in the Pilbara. I think perhaps a lot of the work that has been done in Northern Australia has not taken into account, as much as it should, the need to integrate those people and to ensure that the Indigenous economy is integrated with the broader economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that we have to see is a lot more investment in the science. We have got to be prepared to consider the evidence that has come before us from the CSIRO that, if we set up huge dams, there are going to be a lot of downstream consequences. For example, the impact that that will have on the fishing industry alone will be severe. You cannot take large streams of nutrients out of the system and not expect this to have a consequence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to look at the cost-benefit analysis. We could build these great dams at massive expense. But if we invested that same degree of money into more fine-grain projects, would we get a better outcome? The importance here is to recognise that this is a unique area and that the sorts of responses that we might have seen that worked in the 1950s in the Snowy Mountains scheme are not necessarily the responses for Northern Australia, and that Northern Australia has particular natural advantages that we need to exploit. It should be an area, for example, where renewable energy is an incredibly important part of the energy mix. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We look at the Pilbara where there is a great need for additional energy resources. Yet it is only now that we are coming to see that we need an integratedâand I am very pleased that our Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia really pushed this ideaâpower solution for the Pilbara. It gives us the opportunity to hang off large-scale renewables, exploiting the climatic conditions of the north to create a benefit. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want also to include a bit of a plug for the inclusion of Western Australian universities in the growNORTH initiative. I am very concerned that Western Australian universities have been kept out of this at a meaningful level. They need a seat at the table in the formation of partnership. I have been talking to the chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia about this. We do not just want to be junior partners. Three universities in Western Australia, Murdoch University, Curtin University of Technology and the University of Western Australia, have agreed to come together to form one entity so they can participate jointly in this. </span>

We cannot ignore the weather. We cannot ignore the additional challenges that are coming our way. We need to make sure that we can adapt to those. We are not going to be able to do that without an intelligent engagement with the science, and we want to see Western Australia being part of that scientific development.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="230485" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHRISTENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Nationals Deputy Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  Madam Deputy Speaker Landry, I am pleased to speak on this motion with you in the chair, as a fellow northern Australian. As a fellow north Queenslander from above the Tropic of Capricorn, you know all too well the benefits of living in northern Australia but also the challenges at the moment. Certainly your electorate of Capricornia is facing some very big challenges with Cyclone Marcia crossing the coast, and you have been a tower of strength for that community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, I was fortunate enough to take part in the inquiry into the development of northern Australia and had the opportunity to see much of Australia beyond the beautiful coastal strip of north Queensland that I call home. My electorate of Dawson is some 400 kilometres long, stretching from Mackay to Townsville. During that inquiry I saw the potential just waiting to happen. The chairman of that inquiry, beside me, the member for Leichhardt, definitely saw the potential. There was a lot of potential. The top half of Australia is home to about four per cent of our population, yet it is home to a wealth of resources and opportunitiesâland, water, minerals, sunshine, beaches and islands, fisheries and people who are not afraid to work hard for a living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While our proximity to Asia might not make us a super food bowl, it does provide enormous opportunities for agriculture, for tourism, for exports and for trade. We have some of the largest reserves of some of the best and cleanest coal in the world, which could be used to provide electricity to millions of the world's poorest people for the first time. Doing so would also provide enormous wealth to this country through royalties, company tax, and income tax paid on behalf of thousands of people who could be employed in delivering our natural resources to the world. Thousands of jobs and hundreds of businesses hang in the balance in north Queensland now, because the Labor Party is too busy pandering to extreme greens to worry about the people they are supposed to representâand that is, the worker, or in this case the out-of-worker.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are other key industries that need to be encouraged and developed. The Liberal-National government is already implementing policy in these areas and the upcoming white paper will identify priority projects and policies that will bring about the best results for little or no cost. This government has already proven a willingness and desire to invest in infrastructure that counts, spending money and creating jobs in the production of assets that will deliver for the economy and deliver for Australia and northern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can point to the $6.7 billion investment that we will be making over a 10-year period in the Bruce Highway, which is the lifeblood of north Queensland. I know the member for Kennedy is very passionate about that as well, as is the member for Herbert and the member for Leichhardt. We all agree that that money needs to go there. Already work has begun on a number of projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The planning and detailed design of the Mackay Ring Road is well underway and we hope to see the construction of that commencing in 2016-17. Another important infrastructure area for North Queensland is the mobile phone network, where black spots present safety and productivity issues. The government's Mobile Black Spot Program is working with industry to secure the best value for money for taxpayers in addressing high-priority network black spots.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, the north sees very little rain during the dry season, but during the wet it really rains. So new infrastructure in the form of dams would provide a steady, reliable source of water for resources, agriculture and communities. I point to the Urannah dam project, on the doorstep of my electorateâin your electorate, in fact, Madam Deputy Speakerâwhich would open up an area of greenfield irrigation development only 100 kilometres from existing agriculture: the sugar industry of the Burdekin to the north and the horticultural industry of Bowen to the south.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Construction of a dam is a long-term project, so Urannah is not a project to solve the immediate problems of unemployment experienced in the town of Bowen. Labor and the Greens getting out of the way of job-creating projects like Abbot Point and the Galilee Basin is the best way to do that. But the long-term future of Bowen could be secured through Urannah and also through the extension of the Elliot Main Channel, which is partly constructed already. The Elliot Main Channel is partly built and is designed to transport 60,000 megalitres of water from the Burdekin through 93 kilometres of open channel and then 63 kilometres of pipeline.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is more to the north than agriculture. Tourism is one aspect. I have to congratulate the member for Herbert for the efforts that he has made to secure government funding to deliver international flights into Townsville airport. For my part, I am working on tourism in the Whitsundays, trying to remove some of the crazy regulations on taxation, duties and the environment that we have in relation to super yachts coming into the Whitsundays. If we could get them there it would drive in $50,000 every week for every superyacht that is docked in the port. That would mean jobsâjobs for that community. We have to get northern Australia booming; it is vitally important.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HX4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  The member for Perth gave a most extraordinary speech. She said there really should not be any development and there should not be any dams. She said we should listen to CSIRO because they have some good ideas. I have been listening to them for 42 years and I am dammed if I have heard any ideas on northern development, outside of water proposals. And as for increasing cattle production by 40 per cent, I can absolutely assure the House that if that was possible to do we would have already done it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that we are probably looking at a 40 per cent decrease in cattle production because of the droughts. We do not need to have droughts. Virtually every single station property in North Queensland has water running past it every year. So, as long as they were given 300 hectares of freehold irrigation land we would not have such a thing as a drought in northern Australia because, unlike the rest of Australiaâif not the rest of the worldâwe are on rivers and creeks that run every year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be very specific: my home town is Cloncurry. My family have lived in or around the Cloncurry River for 120 years. It has run every single year for 120 years, and Cloncurry is 500 kilometres from the sea. So it is as inland as you can get.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what are we doing with this land that the good Lord has bequeathed us? What are we doing with it? I will tell you what we are doing with it. Seven million hectares of what was designated on the old map as the best natural grasslands in AustraliaâI am talking of the Sun map, a commercial map you bought at the garageânow does not have that grassland on it. The map should have on it 'prickly acacia infestation' because seven million hectares of beautiful grasslands has been destroyed by prickly acacia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable member for Perth may not understand that nature does not stand still. We should involve ourselves to ensure that the beautiful, natural environment which the good Lord gave us, is protected and turned into a useful asset for the people of the world. If Australians seriously considered it they would realise that if you take a 100-kilometre coastal strip out of northern Australia and a little dot around Darwin, there would be about 100,000 people living in an area almost the size of Europe, which has a population of 600 million or 700 million. What is that area producing? It is producing $100 million-worth of cattle and little bit of tourism trade in Darwin. The rest of its production is so small that it does not require mentioning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have an area the size of Europe with an average rainfall of 30 inches or 40 inches. In the electorate of the honourable member for Leichhardt the rainfall is over 60 inches. And what is that area producing? It is producing $100 million-worth of cattle, and that is it. We look after it so well that seven million hectares of natural grasslands has been completely destroyed by prickly acacia tree. If we were to take seven per cent of that water and two per cent of that land we could produce $20,000 million-worth of prawn and fish product and we would have the cattle production.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do take your point: we can do processing in northern Australia. And we could produce all of the transport petrol requirements for Australia. We send $25,000 million every year to the Middle East to buy petrol when that money could be going into Northern Australia. If we use seven per cent, 93 per cent of that water will run, as it has always run, to the sea. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />And what the young lady from Perth does not understand is that the northern rivers just go: whoosh. They are only there for two or three months of the year. No matter how many dams you build, you are still going to have a huge flood at the start of the year and nothing at the end of the year. The change to nature is negligible. All you will see at the mouth of the Mitchell River will be a flood that is probably two feet lower than the annual 60-foot flood that it normally is. That is the only difference that you will see, and yet in return for that we can produce food where our nearest neighbourâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="7K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ENTSCH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  It certainly gives me pleasure to rise and stand in support of the member for Herbert's outstanding motion in confirming the government's commitment to the delivery of the white paper on the development of Northern Australia. There have been proposals on this since 1935, and a whole lot of opportunities that have been squandered in the past. There is no doubt about it: this government is absolutely committed to deliver on this one. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The white paper was due out at the end of February. Unfortunately, with the change of Queensland government, we have to wait until the Queensland Premier signs off on it, because it is important that the state and territories have ownership of that. We will certainly have the white paper out well and truly before the May budget, and there is no question about that for those that may be concerned about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was the chair of the committee that travelled around looking at opportunities that were there, and the opportunities are endless. I notice that the member for Herbert, rightfully so, boasted about recent achievements in relation to the Townsville Airport. We are recommending that our regional airports in Northern Australia increase capacity and are given the opportunity to do that. If I could just do a little bit of boasting of my own: our humble Cairns international airport last year had 4.3 million passengers. This year over 4.6 million passengers are expected through the airportânot a bad achievement for a small, regional airportâand we are certainly looking at growing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about customs and border security, again we are talking Townsville Airport, but we also need that expanded right across Northern Australia. Our border security agencies are based here in Northern Australia. I have been arguing very strongly that the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Choules</span> should be removed from Sydney and based in Far-North Queensland. We would love to have it at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Cairns</span>. Given that the LHCs have been recently retired, it would help to replace that capacity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are lots of other things. We also should be looking at CSIRO, if we are going to talk about expanding our agriculture, which we definitely have to do. We need extension offices there, and we need agencies like the CSIRO expanded into our regions to be able to offer those services to support the growth in that area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the member for Kennedy talking about water. He is absolutely right: of course we have learnt a lot from the past but we are effectively able to build dams these days considering all of the likely impacts. We talk about Nullinga on the Walsh River, which he talked about, which will significantly increase the capacity of the tablelands with the addition of the Tinaroo Dam. It will also give a long-term water supply for the growth of Cairns as a city. The triple benefit is that it will ensure that the existing hydro station at Barron Gorge can reach full capacity, so providing a baseload for renewal power. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our reportâand we are really looking forward to itâwe talked about roads, we talked about the Hann Highway, we talked about the rebuilding of the beef roads, and we talked about the Tanami. They are all very important things that we need to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Perth mentioned the integrated energy power grid at the Pilbara. Absolutely that is a recommendation that we have in the report. She talked also about the university involvement, and I am looking forward to going to Perth to speak to her universities, because it is very important that they come on board with JCU, Charles Darwin University and, of course, CQU to get that northern Australia expertise. Those universities are going to play an integral part in a whole range of opportunities that will be available there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We talked about agriculture. We talked about fisheriesâexpanding on fisheries. Aquaculture is another one. You have to ask the question: why is it that there has not been a new project on the eastern seaboard for 13 years, yet according to CSIRO we have 1.3 million hectares across northern Australia that is suitable for aquaculture?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are lots of opportunities out there. We are certainly very much looking forward to capturing many of those opportunities in the white paper when it is released in the not-too-distant future. Once we have those opportunities identified in that white paper, we are certainly looking forward to the opportunities we can create for private enterprise to invest and for enabling legislation to happen. I think northern Australia has a great future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr KATTER:</span>
                  </a>  Northern Australia, stripped to a 100-kilometre belt, is an area comparable to the size of Europe. If it were a separate country, it would be one of the wettest countries on earth. Taking out that little narrow strip and a little dot around Darwin, it is populated by fewer than 70,000 people; there is no-one living there. Yet here is an area with tens of millions of square kilometres of arable land. Here is an area awash with water; it has three-quarters of Australia's water. Outside northern Australia, there actually is no water for irrigation except on the Murray-Darling and little, tiny, short streams that run from the divide into the sea, so there is no potential for development of agriculture outside the northern third of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at what we have done. In the last 30 years, there has not been a single dam or a single weir, yet each government has come in, as this government has come in, and said, 'Oh, we're going to develop the water resources of the North.' Where? Getting out a white paper is not developing a resource. If under the Bjelke-Petersen government you had put out a white paper or had a study on it, you would get sacked from the ministry immediately, and I can name you three ministers who were sacked for just that. As he quite rightly said: 'If you can't make a decision then get the hell out of this room. We make decisions; we don't say what we're going to do.' We have discussions with the alternative governments in Brisbane and the LNPâsome of themâabout what we are going to do. Well, we are not interested in what you are going to do. When we went to an election in the eighties, we would tell you what we had done. We would not tell you what we were going to do, because no-one is going to trust a politician's promise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking about another white paperâfor heaven's sake! We have had white papers and green papers and purple papers and tissue papers, and what have we got out of it? I will tell you what we got: getting those papers out slowed us down. Do not listen to me, Madam Deputy Speaker. A candidate for the LNP in the last election told the minister in Canberra what he could do with his white paper. I cannot use his language here in this chamber, but we are not interested in white papers. There has been $120 million spent on studies and white papers in the last 30 years, but there has not been one politician with enough ability to build a single weir across a single creekânot a shovel-load of concrete across a gutter in 30 years. Everyone gets up and talks about 'developing the North' and 'food bowl of Asia' and, 'We're going to build all these dams.' Do not talk about it. Tell us you are doing it or shut your mouth, because we are sick of hearing about your white papers. No-one has even bothered to attend the meetings. I mean no disrespect to the member for Leichhardt, who I think is very genuine in his attributes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the minute or so that is still available to me, let me paint for you a picture. Instead of spending $25,000 million a year to buy petrol from overseas, we produce the petrol ourselvesârenewable so that it does not send CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> up into the atmosphere. Yes, it does send CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;"></span>up into the atmosphere and the sugarcane and grain pull it back down the next year. So it goes up and down; it does not stay up there. Al Gore, in his book, <span style="font-style:italic;">An inconvenient truth</span>, says ethanol was the first answer to CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span><span style="text-decoration:none underline;">. </span>Every country on earth is now doing ethanol, with the exception of Australia and the African states. That is outside of the oil producers, of course, in the Middle East. Every single country is doing it, and they are not doing it to look after their farmers, I can assure you. They are doing it because of health reasons. In Australia, surely it is preferable that we have a source of our own petrolâwhich we do not have, for the first time in our history, virtually. If we have a hiccup in our security, all they need do is cut off our petrol and it will close down the whole countryâbecause it all comes from overseas. We can produce $10,000 million worth of petrol every year without much outlay and capital cost whatsoever. That is what we can do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can produce $10,000 million worth over a period of 10 years in prawn and fish farming. We can do that immediately. We can stop the erosion and destruction of our natural flora and fauna with the creeping Prickly acacia tree. We can stop that by putting strip pasture along the banks of our creeks, increasing our cattle production 600 per cent. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  I am very pleased to speak on this private member's business which is of fundamental interest to me and my constituents in Durack and, I would like to think, people throughout our nation and internationallyâwhat we like to call the 'great untapped North'. I acknowledge the importance of northern Australia and the government's intent to unlock its potential through the northern Australia white paper process and the importance of strengthening links between the east and west, regionally and internationally, through good planning and good investment in vital infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a member of the joint select committee that undertook the inquiry into the development of northern Australia. Whilst we have completed that inquiry and published our report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Pivot n</span><span style="font-style:italic;">orth</span>, our work continues as we review the green paper on the development of northern Australia. Our committee looks to the imminent white paper on northern Australia, noting that <span style="font-style:italic;">Pivot </span><span style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span style="font-style:italic;">orth</span>'s recommendations will dovetail into the white paper. That will be the process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the private members business raised today, I agree that the provision of customs and border security at Townsville Airport is worthy and in line with the recommendations in <span style="font-style:italic;">Pivot </span><span style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span style="font-style:italic;">orth</span>. While such an investment would underpin trade and tourism growth for Townsville and Queensland, the recommendations in the report promote a more expansive view. We must think of northern Australia holistically and cease thinking of single sites and focus on development of the northern region in its own right. If we do that, we will all benefit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a proud country girl and very proud to be representing the regionsâin particular the north-westâhowever, as a federal politician, I look forward to the day my constituents say, 'Welcome to the north of Australia.' That will be because they are all looking east-west, rather than as they do in Western Australia now, north-south. If they start looking east-west, I am sure there will be more business solutions and opportunities for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I highlight recommendation 26 from <span style="font-style:italic;">Pivot north</span>, which promotes the design and implementation of a 20-year strategy for staged development of capital infrastructure in northern Australia, including increasing the capacity of ports and airports to facilitate an increase in volumes of traffic and trade. Our airports in the north, including Townsville, Broome, Kununurra, Exmouth, Derby, Darwinâto name a fewâshould be developed, and I believe they are the key, to increased trade and tourism across the whole of northern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To further illustrate the importance of adopting an inclusive predisposition to the development of the north, I just thought I would mention a few of the recommendations from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Pivot north</span> report. These include the creation of a department of northern Australia; committing funds to key roads such as the Tanami Road and National Highways; investigating potential for a special economic zone for northern Australia; and development of a tourism strategy for promoting northern Australia, domestically and internationally. I would just pause there, as I would like to mention and strongly support the development of a casino in Karratha as a fabulous tourism opportunity not only for northern Australia but also the whole of Western Australia. Other recommendations included the investigation of transfer facilities for cattle across Australiaâvery important to the people of Durack; the creation of a cooperative research centre for northern agriculture; the design and implementation of a 20-year strategy for staged development of horticulture and agriculture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of agriculture, I just want to acknowledge Mr Philip Hams, who is visiting Parliament House today. Philip hails from Gogo Station in the Fitzroy region of the Kimberley. Philip is very passionate and he is here to lobby for development of agriculture in the Fitzroy region in conjunction with the local Indigenous people. He is indeed a northern warrior.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The development of the north, as we have heard throughout this debate today, needs to be planned for the long-term benefit of our children and our children's children. But let us not kid ourselves. We know that there are impediments, but they can be overcome. These impediments include the requirement for population growth, the absence of physical capital infrastructure, and also the absence of social infrastructure in many places. People will need to be encouraged to go to the north and to stay there. I and many of my colleagues who represent people from the northern parts of Australia know that it is a great place to live. We also know that in many parts there is a high rate of liveability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud that this government is committed to delivering a white paper on developing Northern Australia that will set out a clear and well-defined policy platform for unlocking the potential of the north. But, like many of the speakers before me today, I actually want actionâI am tired of talk and I am tired of papersâand the people of the north deserve nothing less.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  I missed the contribution by the member for Herbert, but I assume that when he, in the motion, speaks about new customs and border security arrangements at Townsville Airport he is talking about the opportunity to secure international flights. I am sure that is something that the opposition would be happy to support. Maybe I should have consulted my transport spokesperson before saying that, but it sounds like a reasonable proposition to me and one which would be good for the local economy there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From what I have seen of the debate, it has become a much broader debate not inconsistent with the motion, as put, about the economic development of Northern Australia. It is a debate we should be having in this place and one we should be having in this place on a regular basis. There are very significant opportunities for us in Northern Australia, for the people who live in Northern Australia, for the businesses which operate in Northern Australia and of course for the country more generally, because of the potential it has for our national economyâand particularly when we think about the opportunities further to our north in terms of what I call the 'dining' boom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My concern though is that we have been doing a fair bit of talking about the development of Northern Australia in this place over the course of the last 16 or 17 months without doing much about it. We have seen the promise of a white paper which is yet to be delivered. We had a joint select committee established with great fanfare, which was talked about a lot, but not much action since. I think we got some fairly sensible recommendations out of the committee process, but the government is yet to respond in any substantial way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, when Labor was last in government, we established an Office of Northern Australia. We had a minister for Northern Australia. We had a significant coordination effort across state and territory governments working together to lower barriers to investment, and to properly coordinate strategies and plans for Northern Australia. Continuity is important in these matters. The truth is that we have had a hiatus for the last 16 or 17 months. We have had policy inertia while the government of the day talks about the development of Northern Australia rather than concentrating on doing something about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to highlight some inconsistencies here. People like to talk about what governments need to do. Yes, that is important. I have mentioned a few: developing strategies, coordination, lowering barriers to investment et cetera. But it is the private sector that in the end will determine our success or the extent of the success in Northern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to the Greener Pastures report, we know that to fully capitalise on the food opportunities in Asia we will need around $500 billion of investment in infrastructure in this country out to 2050. In this world in which the competition for global capital is intense, this will not be easy. As we have a relatively small population, with limited savings, by definition and by necessity much of that investment will come from foreign capital. What we do not need at the moment is a government putting additional barriers in the way of those inflows of foreign capital. That is exactly what the government has done by reducing the FIRB threshold for investment in agricultural land and agri-businessâalthough I must note they are still debating what the threshold will be for agri-business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be open to foreign investment. Yes, we should be discerning about who invests, where they invest and how they invest. We do need a register. The Labor Party first committed to an open and transparent investment register. But the government has given no additional resources to the FIRB for this new process. We are going to have a logjam of applications, most of which are completely unnecessary in terms of FIRB scrutiny. This is not the way to welcome foreign investment into this country. Therefore, this is not the way to ensure that we have the infrastructure we will need to properly and fully develop Northern Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="220370" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs GRIGGS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  I rise to address the motion moved by the member for Herbert, for which I thank him. The reason I want to be involved in this is that the electorate of Solomon, and indeed the whole of the Northern Territory, has a lot to offer in terms of effort to unlock the economic potential of Northern Australia. I see the member for Lingiari in here and I am sure he will agree with me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the 2013 election the coalition released a policy entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">The coalition's 2030 vision for developing Northern Australia</span>. We are determined to ensure that the North gets the attention it deserves. We are proposing that by 2030 Northern Australia could drive growth by developing premium food from a food bowl of the North, growing the tourist economy in the north to two million visitors annually, and by building a $150 billion energy export industry with a focus on clean and efficient energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, Darwin is the best equipped city in Northern Australia to meet the challenges of the coming century. I know that the member for Herbert will disagree with me, because I am sure he thinks it is Townsville. I know that the member for Lingiari will probably think that it is Alice Springs. Then there are a few in the west, such as the member for Durack. But I am speaking now so I get to say that Darwin is the best place. The reason is that we already have a lot of pieces in place. Darwin has a major airport capable of handling any commercial aircraft, and it is a pivotal location. Within four hours flying time to the south there are six mainland capital cities, 20 major trading ports, 23 international airports and just under 23 million people. However, going the same distance north reaches eight international capital cities, 36 major trading ports, 69 international airports and a potential market of nearly half a billion people. So I think that puts us in good stead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have a deep-water port capable of handling ships up to 80,000 tonnes. Adjacent to that is a major freight hub connecting to rail and road. Darwin and the Top End have a large and highly-skilled workforce, with expertise in agriculture, resources, construction, fisheries and tourism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stand here today, my electorate is already reaping the benefits of our strategic location and our open-for-business mentality. Last week the Prime Minister and I opened the $90 million meat-processing facility just outside Darwin in the member for Lingiari's electorate. This facility will give Australia the ability to tap into South-East Asia's growing demand for beef. It will provide jobs for locals and a means for the Northern Territory Australian beef producers to sell directly to a local supplier, and it is a great example of the sort of value adding that will be great for Australia's economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A multibillion-dollar facility is under construction at Blaydon Point to refine gas that will be sold to Japan. Thousands of people are employed directly in the construction, and the flow-on the effects have resulted in a boom for the local economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to stand here today as part of the coalition government which is delivering both infrastructure and the business environment needed to develop the North. The carbon tax was effectively a tax on remoteness and in Northern Australia the energy needed to cool our homes and our offices, the energy needed to travel vast distances and the energy needed to manufacture much-needed goods was taxed unnecessarily. So the people in North Australia are actually delighted that the carbon tax has gone and they are actually delighted that the mining tax has gone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are still challenges to be met, and the coalition government is working to meet those. I am determined to work with both my coalition colleagues and my Northern Territory government colleagues to ensure that the Top End and, indeed, all of the Northern Territory, is at the forefront of the dialogue about developing North Australia. As I said, Darwin should be known as the capital of North Australia. I thank the member for Herbert for bringing this motion to the House and giving me the opportunity to talk about how wonderful my electorate it is.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IJ4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:26</span>):  This motion gives an opportunity to talk about a range of things, quite clearly. Whilst I agree broadly with the sentiments of those who have spoken previously, I do have some major issues about the current governance in the Northern Territory which I think detracts substantially from our attractiveness as a place for investment by the wider community. The Northern Territory government is basically dysfunctional.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do not want to talk about that any more today. I would like to talk about an individual who has been an advocate of developing Northern Australia now for many years. Sadly, this individual passed away over the weekend. He was a very good friend of mineâKwementyaye 'Tracker' Tilmouthâwho I worked with at the Central Land Council many years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tracker was an extraordinary man, a member of the stolen generation who once said, 'They made a mistake when they took us away; they educated us,' meaning that he became aware of a whole range of things that he could possibly do about the plight of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Northern Territory, but most particularly about himself. He went away subsequently to get a degree in agricultural management at university in South Australia. He came back to the Northern Territory and worked as the director of the Central Land Council, and he was instrumental in changing the way people thought about using Aboriginal land for economic development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was a key to the development of Centrefarm, a quite innovative proposal which was developed around the idea of how to use horticulture on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory and most particularly in Central Australia. And very successful they have been. He showed how you are able to develop Aboriginal land. He showed how you could use the resources within the landâthat is, waterâto develop horticultural and agricultural services in the bush. They are doing quite well at the moment, but they could do significantly better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it was not only in horticulture; he had great innovative ideas around the pastoral industry, the engagement with the pastoral industry more broadly and the use of Aboriginal land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is not only in horticulture; he had great innovative ideas around the pastoral industry and the engagement with the pastoral industry more broadly and the use of Aboriginal land. He has great vision about the role of the pastoral industry and the capacity of Aboriginal landowners to use the land resources they have for the pastoral industry and for their own community's economic benefit. He wasâthough sadly no longerâat the forefront of forging new relationships between the pastoral industry and Aboriginal landowners. He was also a great believer in the mining industry and, in working as a consultant subsequent to his employment at the Central Land Council, played a significant role in talking to and with the mining industry about developing mines on Aboriginal land again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He will be missed greatly by all those who knew him. I think it will be some time before we see his like again, in terms of someone who had a vision around what the North could look like by engaging with Aboriginal traditional owners as key instruments and drivers of economic development. Sadly, that is not the case in the broader community where, broadly speaking, Aboriginal people are taken for granted and are seen as the subjects of investment rather than being owners of investment or partners of investment and people who can drive change. It is very important to contemplate what that all meansâand he was someone who believed in it; knew how to do it; articulated on behalf of traditional owners their best interests at their direction; and, at the same time, was able to sit around a board table and talk about international economics and the books of major companies. He could talk about all of these things. He was a man for all seasons, in many ways. He could sit down in the dirt and talk to traditional owners in language about a range of things and, at the same time, he could sit a mining company's directors table and talk in their language about mining, pastoral issue, horticulture, agriculture or, indeed, fishing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He will be sadly missed. He was a close personal friend of mine. To his wonderful wife, Kathy, and their children Cathryn, Shaneen and Amanda: God bless you.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In opening this debate I call on the government to take up the mantra of the young people in Indi, that 'Where ever you are in Australia, you should be able to use your mobile phone.' I call on the government to start with the end in mind. The end is where mobile phone blackspots are a thing of the past, where we are able to work, travel, study and holiday with our trusty mobile phones in hand, in the city and in the bush. This will take money, partnerships and commitment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been fighting to improve mobile phone coverage in Indi from the day I was first drafted by the young people. The poor or non-existent mobile phone services in my electorateâfrom valley to valley, township to townshipâimpact on our economic viability, our social connectedness and our ability as a community to reach our full potential and the overriding need to be safe, particularly when we have emergencies such as fires and floods. Good mobile phone coverage is not an optional extra; it is the main game.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's Black Spot program extended mobile phone coverage in regional Australiaâ$100 million over four years to provide around 250 to 300 new or upgraded mobile base stations across Australia. The Black Spot program is a good program. It was an election commitment that the government is delivering on. The establishment work has been done, priorities have been listed and partnerships built. Today I encourage the government and my colleagues opposite to maximize the work done in this establishment phase and to expand it to pick up the next level of priorities that have already identified.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly more funding is needed if we are to make sure that, where ever you are in Australia, you can use your mobile phone. But the hard reality is that the Department of Communications database has in excess of 6,000 reports of mobile phone black spotsâand, in my electorate of Indi alone, 274 reports. The guidelines for the program point to improving coverage along the major transportation routes, in small communities, in locations prone to existing natural disasters and in areas with high seasonal demandâand Indi ticks all these boxes. We have 274 identified gaps, but we are allocated an estimated three towers to meet this need. It is clearly not enough; Indi and Australia need a much greater investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What to do? All levels of government, business and community are ready to act, and the Commonwealth is providing the leadership; it just needs the commitment. In Indi the groundwork has been done. The Indi Telecommunications Advocacy Group have taken the lead in mapping and reporting the mobile phone black spot areas. Strong partnerships have been developed with business, emergency services and community groups, seeking every opportunity to work with mobile network operators and mobile network infrastructure providers. They are very keen to offer their in-kind contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister says that he wants to be remembered as the 'infrastructure Prime Minister.' I am here today to remind the Prime Minister that infrastructure is more than roads, rail and transport. Telecommunications is also infrastructure. Investment in communications infrastructure has the capacity to stimulate and enhance all areas of our economy. It is an investment that has multiplier effects throughout the economy and the community, and it gives as everlasting social and environmental benefits. This is the government's published infrastructure message, so I call on the government to make this the message for communications infrastructure also.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on Minister Truss to move now on building stronger regional economies and secure communities, delivering opportunities and prosperity for all regional Australians and ensuring a sustainable environment by allocating funding in the next budget to an extensive mobile phone black spot program. One hundred million dollars is not nearly enough to cover the need. Let us start with the young people's manta, make it our own and set an ambitious target, a date, so that by 2020, wherever you are in Australia, wherever you go, you are able to use your mobile phone.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting"> (</span>
                  <span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">):</span>  I second the motion. I rise to speak on this motion before the chamber today. I want to start by saying that it was the coalition government, the federal government, as recognised by the member for Indi, that has made this very significant $100 million commitment that we are rolling out. We are incredibly proud that we have recognised the importance of mobile phone communications across rural and regional Australia. Like the member for Indi, I represent a large regional seat. One hundred and thirty-six black spots have been identified in the federal electorate of Corangamite and have been registered with the Department of Communications. We know how important it is for small businesses, for farmers and for families to feel connected, particularly in areas of high bushfire risk. There are many parts of my electorate where there are high bushfire risk areas, and being connected by your mobile phone is so important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do commend the member for Indi for bringing on this motion today, but I would like to say that the coalition government is the best friend of the people of Indi. The coalition government is the best friend of rural and regional Australia because, in contrast to our $100 million program, the previous Labor government, over six years, did not contribute one centânot one centâto fixing mobile phone black spots. In my first speech, I proudly stood up on behalf of the people of Dereel and I spoke about how that community in my electorate was ravaged by a bushfire early in 2013. They were hampered because they had no communications. The telephone lines were down, and they could not get the emergency alerts. I went in and I vowed to fight for them, and I vowed to fight for the people of Birregurra, the people of Gellibrand and every other community in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree with the member for Indi. I would like to see more funding in this program because it is a wonderful program. I have already been lobbying the Minister for Communications in relation to more funding. Quite frankly, it is a terrible reflection on Labor that they have not recognised how important mobile phone communications is. It is like the NBN rollout under Laborâan utter disaster. The previous Labor federal government did not recognise that it must prioritise areas that need communications the most. Like the NBN, like food labelling, like standing up for small business, we are working very hard to stand up for rural and regional communities across Australia. It is like the fight for fairer fuel pricesâanother fight that you did not hear about under the previous government. These are big challenges, as the member for Indi has recognised, but I want to say that, of the 6,000 mobile phone black spots that have been identified, around 4,500 are sufficiently close to other nominated locations such that it is likely that one base station will be able to provide mobile phone coverage to a number of black spots. This is very, very heartening. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also commend the minister's work in relation to identifying the partnerships, the co-contributions. In my electorate, I particularly want to commend the Golden Plains Shire, which has put forward a proposal in relation to a co-contribution. I have called on the Colac Otway Shire to do that as well. I would like to see more action from the City of Greater Geelong towards making a co-contribution, whether in dollars or in kind. Even places like Armstrong Creek are part of the great development that is occurring in the Greater Geelong region. Many people living in Armstrong Creek cannot get mobile phone coverage. For the people of Birregurra, Dereel, Gellibrand and all the other parts of my electorate and right across Australia, we are incredibly proud of our commitment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, I too would like to see more funding. In fact, I am so determined about it that on a recent visit by the Prime Minister to my electorate I said that we must stop at Birregurra. We dropped into the Birregurra general store where they serve a wonderful toasted sandwich and a great cup of coffee. I said: 'Prime Minister, I am bringing you here to Birregurra because the people of Birregurra need a mobile phone base station. They cannot do business in this wonderful part of the world unless they get the communications.' I am very proud of our government<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s commitment to this wonderful program. I support the motion, and I condemn Labor for its absolute failure to invest in mobile phone communications. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROWLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  I want to thank the member for Indi for bringing this very important motion to the attention of the House. It is very clear to see why the voters of Indi put their trust in her, and I want to acknowledge her diligence on this issue and lend my support to the motion that is before the House. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the issues with mobile black spotsâand this is what a lot of people do not quite comprehendâis that it is not necessarily a bit of black in a sea of white. A black spot is often a black spot in a sea of black, which underlies how different and how difficult it is to reach many parts of regional Australia. Whilst telco companies can claim their networks cover large proportions of the population, even up to 99 per cent of the population, the reality is that these high levels of coverage only equate to about 25 per cent of Australia<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s actual land mass. This is a reflection of Australia<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s highly urbanised population. Whilst our mobile carriers are always continuing to expand their coverage, there are limits to this coverage. The Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy stated in its document titled <span style="font-style:italic;">The 2011-12 regional telecommunications review</span>: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ there are commercial limits to how far carriers are prepared to extend the mobile coverage footprint in regional areas. Much of the expansion programs are focused on boosting network capacity rather than increasing the coverage footprint.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to this, both federal and state governments have gone down the path of direct subsidy schemes in order to boost mobile coverage in rural and regional areasâand here are some examples. The Howard government spent around $145 million on improving terrestrial mobile phone infrastructure. Separate to this, in 2005, the Howard government established the Mobile Connect programâan $8 million program designed to extend mobile phone coverage in selected remote areas. Unfortunately, no applications were received from carriers. The regional telco committee further stated that it:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ understands this was due to the programâs lack of scale, the remoteness of most of the priority locations that had been specified, and the associated servicing costs these sites would attract.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it all became too hard. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a few comments about the notion that the Libs and the Nats think they are the bastion of rural and regional communications and that they are the best friends of the people of Indi when it comes to regional communications, because the evidence shows that they are plainly not. You only have to look at the doyen of conservative telecommunications economics, Henry Ergas. Henry Ergas is no friend of ours, but he is a mate of Minister Turnbull's. In his book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Wrong Number: Resolving Australia's Telecommunications Impasse</span>, he notes $3 billion frittered away by the coalition under John Howardâ$3 billion. He writes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">These direct 'command and control' regulations have been paralleled by other interventions, often lacking in transparency and accountability â¦ Thus, since 1997, over $3 billion (at 2007 prices) of taxpayers' money has been appropriated to schemes aimed at promoting the availability of use of telecommunications, mainly in non-metropolitan areas.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on. It refers to the Communications Fund. It gives line items: 'Mobile Connect' and 'Clever Networks.' What does that equate to? It equates to $3 billion wasted under John Howard while the convergence debate came and went, and here we still are today talking about basic voice accessibility in black spots.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And this is the problem. The problem is the laissez-faire attitude of the Liberal Party in charge of this. You only have to hear the parliamentary secretary stand up and say, 'Markets will resolve this.' That is their problem: 'Markets will resolve this.' At least we on this side are consistent. We say that where there is a market failure you identify the failure, you regulate and you have government intervention to the extent of that failure, unlike the Libs here running the show, giving free rein to markets. So I will not take a lecture from the member opposite. If we had $3 billion today to put into regional telco, maybe we would have a difference and we would not be here where we are today, still arguing about basic voice telephony. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not trust the Libs to do it. I do not trust the Libs to do it. And guess what: neither does your colleague the member for Mallee. The member for Mallee does not trust you either. Recently in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunraysia Daily,</span> he savaged the communications minister and Mr Fletcher on their administration of the program:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"Frankly, it is too slow to roll out," â¦ "Weâve been in government for 17 months now and are still fluffing around over it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">âItâs time we got it done.â</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then he went on to point out the stupidity of this government overpromising and underdelivering. There are about 300 mobile black spots in the Mallee alone. So I will not take a lecture from those people opposite about how to improve regional telecommunications, because we know only one side here is absolutely committed to it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  I rise to talk in support of this motion. I might just remind members of the House that John Howard, who has recently been criticised in this very chamber for delivering so much in the communication space, left a surplus, he left $20 billion in the bank, he left the Future Fund and he paid off the nation's mortgage. One would think any incoming government would put that fiscal position to good use. But, as we all know, for six years they sat on their hands and did nothing. You would think with the size of the deficit and the debt that has been built upâhundreds of billions of dollars of debtâthere would be something to show for it. But in the mobile phone space there was absolutely no contribution whatsoeverâabsolutely nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I am so pleased to be able to be part of a coalition government that is actually putting its money where its mouth is. We have a $100 million black spot mobile phone program, which, as you know, is being rolled out. That $100 million is obviously not enough, but hopefully, coupled with contributions from about 130 local councils and/or state governments and co-contributions from industry, that will accumulate enough funds to put out at least 250 or perhaps 300 more base stations. It has been an exhaustive process and it is frustrating. But you have to choose from so many areas that are in the grey zone or, as happens in our area, areas that become black spots. When there are huge volumes of people holidaying in the electorate, the mobile phone coverage is overwhelmed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bradfield, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, visited the Lyne electorate and accompanied me to a roundtable with lots of people who were affected by black spots in their day-to-day life or when emergencies happen. We did have a roundtable discussion in Wauchope. Areas that came to mind from that were the upper Hastings, Comboyne, Mount Seaview, the Camden Haven and many overloaded beach locations, where the population can double for two months over Christmas or during the school holidays when you basically cannot get anything done on the mobile network, either data or other internet services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many areas that also desire and merit further help. I have mentioned Comboyne and Mount Seaview. Other areas that we have recorded are Kindee, Forbes River, Byabarra, Lorne, Elands, North Haven, Dunbogan, and West Haven up into Lorneâyou could keep going, including down in the Manning; there are many areas. But we have to get the best value from the limited funds. It is a start. It is going to be multiplied by the in-kind contribution of local councils, with assets and access or fast approval, and with the co-contribution from the big players: Vodafone, Telstra and Optus. We will hopefully get 300 new base stations. I am looking forward to this being rolled out in the Lyne electorate, because we deserve it. We generate so much income. A mobile phone is now so vital in the life of a modern Australian. When you are contacting people at workâas tradesmen, agricultural workers, security workersâa mobile phone is now part of the essentials of modern life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members opposite might criticise us, but we are making a rock-solid commitment. It is rolling out. It is frustrating that it is not there yet. But when you look at the potential areas that need to be sorted through, it is an exhaustive process. The successful locations are going to be announced in the middle of this year and then they will roll out. I am looking forward to the upper Hastings, or even the coastal plain in the valleys just back from the coastal area in the Camden Havenâand also down in the Manningâbeing selected so that at least a couple of these mobile phone black spots can be addressed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BIRD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  I commend the member for Indi for the motion. It is an important issue and increasingly one that we all get significant representations on in our electorates. I represent a seat that covers the third largest city in New South Wales, Wollongong, yet we have significant black spot areas that create a real difficulty for people just trying to lead a normal modern life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was reflecting, as other members were speaking, that as an MP, if somebody had rung your office and said they wanted to talk to you about mobile phone coverage, nine times out of 10 it would have been to complain about the proposed siting of a mobile phone tower. I well remember when I chaired the infrastructure committee of this House and we looked at the legislation that covers those sorts of issues, because there was a great push to clamp down on and narrow the sorts of places that mobile phone towers could be located. You are always dealing with these competing problems: on the one hand, people complain they cannot get mobile phone coverage; on the other, nobody wants mobile phone towers. It has been a vexed problem for members of parliament at all levels, including our local government colleagues, for quite a long time. It is interesting that that has changed in more recent years as people become far more reliant on their mobile phone technology and their mobile broadband technology, which nowadays happens to be in the one device often, and more tolerant of the need to put infrastructure in place in order to get the sort of coverage they expect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of years ago I had a number of organisations come to me from the little town of Bundeena. If you are not familiar with it, it is right on the headland with the sea on one side and the mouth of the river on the other, and it is surrounded by the Royal National Park. It is a beautiful spot but it is really difficult to get mobile phone coverage. Organisations like the local Rural Fire Service, who have to provide services into the Royal National Park, were having real concerns. City based people would come down to have a lovely day and do a walk through the park and so forth. In emergency situations very often people were out of mobile phone range. People are quite complacent; they tend to presume that they can get mobile phone coverage pretty much everywhere these days, and they can be quite put out when those sorts of situations arise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Rural Fire Service and the Bundeena Progress Association have been talking to me for quite a while about their problems. We got some of the carriers to come out and have a look at what they might be able to offer. The problem is that the geography, which makes it such a beautiful place, also limits the population size. It is difficult to get a competitive business argument up for better coverage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It will not surprise anybody that I have put that on my list to Minister Turnbull as a site I would like to see this blackspot program go to. I am shamelessly using the opportunity of this motion put before us by the member for Indi to publicly lobby the minister to look kindly upon our application.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I want to touch on in the bit of time left to meâthe shadow minister is doing a fabulous job in this space by inspiring understanding of the sectorâis, as the previous speaker mentioned, the fact that private providers will often say to you, 'We've got this 90, 95 or 99 per cent coverage.' They are talking about people not place. That, by its very nature, ignores the fact that you are talking about mobile technology. People are mobile, so they are often moving into places that the footprint does not cover. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other two things that the member for Throsby and I have asked the minister to look at are the transport linksâthe road links coming into the Illawarra and the train line. A number of people who commute for work want to use their mobile devices to have conversations and access their broadband. Those transport corridorsâroad and railâare significantly important. So I hope my plea is heard. It is a genuine one. As a large commuter corridor, this area has many people from Sydney moving down. They are often quite horrified when they discover that our topography means that the coverage is not great. I think it is an important aspect of modern life and I am happy to put the plea in on behalf of my constituents.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="231027" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TAYLOR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  I commend the member for Indi, and all of those who spoke on this motion, for their focus on this issue because mobile coverage is of vital importance to countless Australians, particularly in my electorate. I find it difficult to understand how I got by without a mobile phone. It is extraordinary how much we depend on them these days. It is only when we lose our mobile phonesâwhich I do from time to timeâor we run out of battery, which happens to all of us, that we are reminded just how important mobile coverage is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of us who are in country electorates are also reminded of this when we go out of range. And that happens to me every day in my electorate as I get around. Many of my constituents remind me that it happens to them as well. For the many small businessesâthe increasing number of small businessesâbased in my electorate, ranging from the edge of Sydney and Canberra right out into deep rural New South Wales, mobile technology is changing the way that they interact with customers. Mobile coverage ensures that they can be available and responsive to their customers' needs. And it means that they can be out and about, particularly if they are involved in salesâwhether it is on site getting the job done, or getting out to potential new customersâand they can still be available to deal with queries from the office or from existing customers or suppliers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But for many rural and regional Australians the full advantages of mobile phone technology are yet to come because it is too variable or unreliable or just not available at all. So today's motion recognises the importance of this, and how a lack of mobile coverage impacts on people's lives. From my extensive travel throughout my electorate, and the enormous amount of work that my office has done, I can pinpoint almost every mobile blackspot. Very occasionally I hear about a new one, but I pretty much know them all. I appreciate the enormous support I have had from around the electorate in identifying them. That is important to them not just for their work, but it is important for safety as well. There are large sections in the middle of my electorate without coverage where safety is a major issue. The Rural Fire Service talk about this often. In contacting and coordinating volunteers when responding to bushfire emergencies, mobile phone coverage is very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all of these reasons, the government are very aware of these issues, and it is why we are investing $100 million in telecommunications infrastructure to address these issuesâin contrast to the last government, which did no such thing. It was extraordinary listening to the member for Greenway talk about what we needed to do when in fact the last government did not do anything, and I can tell you my constituents are fully aware of that situation. The program will focus on small communities as well as major transport routes and safety issues that arise across so many electorates here in Australia. As I said, this is in complete contrast to the previous government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have identified many problem areas through the course of thisâin fact 6,000. So there is a real need to leverage every dollar of that $100 million as well as we possibly can. We have asked Telstra, Optus and Vodafone to come forward with proposals for new sites and base stations. We expect that that $100 million will generate at least $100 million in private investment. I am also finding a spin-off from all of this is that some of the commercial providers are identifying sites where it is commercial for them to put up towers straightaway. That has certainly been true in Bundanoon and Wilton, where Telstra is proceeding with towers after much consultation with the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are looking at the best ways of using our investment, and in particular we are looking at co-location opportunities. My office has spent an enormous amount of time looking at these opportunities. For example, as part of the rollout of the fixed-wireless network for the NBN we can piggyback mobile coverage on the back of the NBN. At Murringo, between Young and Boorowa, there is a wonderful site to do exactly that. In New South Wales we also have a network of Rural Fire Service towers that can be used for the same purpose. Typically, they have pre-existing roads and even power, and by using those sites we can dramatically reduce the cost of putting up a new tower. We have sites like that at Narrawa near Rugby and not far away at Mount Darling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are significant opportunities to leverage the $100 million program. That is what we intend to do, and I can assure you that my office has done an enormous amount of work to make sure we get as much leverage as we possibly can from the $100 million program. I commend this program to the chamber. It is an important one and one that will make a real difference to the lives of many in my electorate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to bring this motion forward for debate. It relates to a serious health issue which raises important questions about food standard regulations, screening and labelling. In the last month there has been widespread concern in relation to contaminated berries imported from China that have so far been linked with 21 confirmed cases of hepatitis A. While, fortunately, events like this are rare, the gravity of this caseâwhere thousands have been exposed to potential infection of a serious disease and where further cases of hepatitis are likely to developâdemands that we look closely at the shortcomings in our food safety framework.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At present, imported fruits are classified as surveillance foodsâmeaning that only five per cent are randomly tested by the Department of Agriculture in order to comply with the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code. Fruit is principally tested for pesticides and even microbial testing of supposed risk foods is limited to bacteria that are the most common cause of food borne illness. As a result, that testing does not extend to viruses like hepatitis A. This standard compares poorly with the rigour and the cost of screening and inspection that local berry growers face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contamination that has occurred has caused wide community discussion of Australia's framework of food safety precautions. The starting point when it comes to imported food is the recognition that not all countries can match Australia's general quality of agricultural practices and surveillance standards. But, in recognising that it is impossible for any food production or importation process to be absolutely risk free, there is clearly room for improvement. This could include the classification of an expanded range of high-risk foods, the testing of larger sample sizes and the enhancement of screening technologies. I also note that food safety experts have suggested that there should be independent auditing of growers and factories overseas in some circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Agriculture has requested a review of the risk status of frozen berries from Food Standards Australia New Zealand, which I hope will address some of these concerns. Unfortunately, the recent cuts of 280 jobs at FSANZ hardly inspires confidence in terms of the regulator's capacity to provide adequate supervision and guidance. This appears to be another case of a government intent on hacking away at key threads in a web of sensible protection simply because of its inclination to regard all regulation as dispensable red tape. Let us remember that, at the very dawn of this government, the office and chief of staff of the Assistant Minister for Health were involved in seeking to undermine the introduction of food labelling designed to allow Australians to better understand the nutritional value of the foods we eat. I am pleased that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture have realised, if only belatedly, the critical importance of effective food labelling and food regulation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also suggest that in our rush to sign the suite of new trade agreements we have neglected to protect provisions that help ensure broad public safety. It is simply not good enough to allow companies to self-regulate when our health is at stake, and yet there are aspects of recently and blindly celebrated free trade agreements that give foreign companies the ability to contest aspects of Australia's regulatory environment and seek judgements from investor state dispute resolution tribunals that have been shown to be flawed and compromised in their decision making. How soon will it be before the health of Australian citizens is jeopardised by this loss of Australian sovereignty?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a number of occasions I have spoken in this place about Australia's food-labelling laws, which remain inadequate and misleading. This area of regulation has failed to keep pace with a sophisticated consumer culture in which food choices are rightly made on the basis of environmental, political, animal welfare and wider health concerns. Informed decisions cannot be based on information that is cloaked in ambiguous language or built on partial truths. It is not asking too much to expect that 'made in Australia' should mean what an ordinary person would understand by that phrase. It is not too much to expect that companies which do the right thing, for instance when it comes to genuinely free-range farming, have the benefit of making that claim for their produce and are protected from competitors who seek to misrepresent their own poor animal welfare practices.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are fortunate in Australia that food borne illness and infectious disease outbreaks are comparatively rare. That will not remain the case through complacency. It is a state of affairs that is put at risk when the government does not take the proper role of regulation seriously. It is a state of affairs jeopardised by the pursuit of low-yielding free trade agreements that put corporate and market interests ahead of public and environmental health.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The hepatitis A contamination of frozen berries is a reminder that our food standards, labelling and public health protection framework need to be stronger and more effective and not more poorly resourced and subject to the interference of foreign commercial interests. That is why I urge the government to improve and enhance Australia's regulatory capacity in this area and deliver the kind of honesty and clarity in labelling that the Australian community has for many years been calling for.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0H" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAMING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  What a spray! The member just managed to attack foreign interests, corporate greed and free trade agreements all in the one brushstroke and all over this single case of contaminated berries. Coming from a place like Capricornia, Madam Deputy Speaker, you would know just how important it is to be promoting both the consumption and the growing of local products. But this is not quite so simple. This is about a platform that is ultimately about promoting trade and cooperation between nationsâthat growing trade has been of benefit for all nationsâbut also understanding that you have to be able to have a certain level of surveillance for safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through listening very carefully and picking through the rhetoric, I did pick up some suggestions from the opposition speaker: test more foods more often, have more audits and, where possible, use some new technology. You really have to ask a group like FSANZ and the Department of Agriculture exactly what is going to be productive and effective. It is okay to say that only five per cent of consignments are testedâbut that is not five per cent of all packets of frozen berries, don't forget. It is very hard to test an entire chunk of frozen berries and be able to say that there is no hepatitis A anywhere in that chunk of frozen berries. There is probably a couple of contaminated droplets in there with no guarantee you will find it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of this testing is on residue products, which can be seen through an entire consignment. It is far more uncertain trying to find hepatitis <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">A</span>. So before we mislead anyone, there have been no more cases of hepatitis A so far this year than in any other year. We are not facing a tsunami of nasty hepatitis A, spirited in here by some foreign country that needs to be pushed back. We need to have a little bit more of an understanding of where risks are, and respond accordingly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, before we impugn FSANZ, who simply work out the appropriate recommendations, and before we drag in staff changes to FSANZ as being the cause of the hepatitis disasterâwhich of course it is not; and I see the opposition speaker now waving her hands from side to side saying that she was not suggesting thatâlet us remember that they simply make the expert guidelines upon which the Department of Agriculture and others carry out the tests. So it is not just FSANZ that should be picked on here. If you talk to FSANZ, they will say to you, 'In these areas we do not see the staffing changes as in any way affecting the ability to make our recommendations. Recommendations are taken, ultimately, by Agriculture, who carry them out.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is, of course, the bigger picture that is very popularâand that is talking about better country-of-origin labelling and more information for customers. I am sure on that point we can start to agree, because it is less of a hysterical reaction to what happened over the last month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note, also, that the one single case here in the ACT is a good friend of ours, Mr Callum Denness, who actually works in this building. We wish him well in his recovery from what is potentiallyâputativelyârelated to the berry incident. That is very close to home for many of us who work in this building. I think it is important not to get carried away by this immediate reaction to blame other countries and the poor quality of their imports. Ultimately we are tied, through very productive and successful free trade agreements that give both countries in this bilateral arrangement a lot of advantages, and through WTO obligations. Those obligations say that we should not, for the purpose of nationalism, ever be running interference on a foreign product simply because it is from overseas. So let us understand that instead of just reacting and saying, 'Start testing every packet of berries'âand there was a real hint of that in what the opposition speaker was sayingâwe need also to realise that if standards fall and there is a genuine health risk, there is every opportunity under current law to prosecute that particular issue. If health standards are at risk you can take actionâand this is a perfect example of where that can occur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to where our food comes from, there is some level of agreement. I think it is utterly inadequate that you can just say the word 'imported' and that customers do not deserve to know where from. I sense that that will be an area of progress. Over the previous one- or two-year period the rolling average of how much foreign content appears in a mixed food should be the subject of labelling on a packet. If you have room on a packet to say 'imported', you have room to list the largest three providers of that imported component of your productâwhether it is above or below 50 per cent. There is general agreement that just flipping 'imported' and 'local' once it tips over 50 per cent is also inadequate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just leave this debate today by saying that ultimately giving people 20/20 vision, incredible foresight and a PhD in food science is never going to lead every Australian to read packages and labels. We keep squeezing these food manufacturers for the entire Wikipedia to be printed on the backâand sometimes the frontâof products. In the end, Australians want to know, in every areaâgiven that only 15 per cent of what is on the shelves of supermarkets comes from Australiaâright at the margins, what are the producers that have a greater propensity to use Australian products, when there is a choice to do so. In the end perhaps we need something simpler, which is to identify, in categories where there is an Australian component, those companies using the most Australian product in their class. That will be a very productive and fertile area, and one which I am sure both sides can agree on.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  Firstly, I commend the member for Fremantle for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. I say in response to the member for BowmanâI heard his contributionâthat rather than attacking the member for Fremantle and misrepresenting what she said, perhaps he should look back at his own government's stand last week where, led by the Prime Minister, they announced measures that effectively take on board the very concerns that the member for Fremantle has alluded to and raised in the debate today. I welcome those announcements by the government because it shows that we can do more. The real question is: why haven't we done it earlier?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, it took 21 casesâand there may well be moreâof hepatitis A to break out in this country before the political leaders across both sides of politics, including in state governments, finally stood up and took note of what is happening. To date, the representations made by the member for Fremantle, by me, and by many others in this parliament, have effectively fallen on deaf ears. And all we have had in response is lip-service or minor changes that have not given consumers the confidence that they are entitled to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two issues in respect of this matter, and both the member for Fremantle and the member for Bowman talked about them. The first is to do with biosecurity; the second is to do with the labelling system and, in particular, country-of-origin labelling. Only last week in this very chamber I spoke about those matters. When I did so, I called for: firstly, clearer country-of-origin labelling; secondly, more screening; thirdly, equal standards being applied to exporters and importers; and, fourthly, transfer of oversight of country-of-origin labelling to the ACCC, which is something that the Blewett inquiry recommended but was never taken up by our side of politics at the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">World demand for food is growing, and we know that as a result of that we are going to see not only more food transferred from one country to another but also producers of food looking to whatever methods they can to speed up the way in which they produce that food. We will see greater use of pesticides and chemicals. We will also see more insanitary conditions and places that we would not grow food in being used to grow food because of the sheer necessity to do so. That includes the way we grow our poultry and pigs around the worldâI have raised this on previous occasionsâand the use of intensive animal growing, which also raises real health concerns. We are going to see more of this and that is exactly why we need to be more cautious and more vigilant in the way we manage both the importer food coming into this country and how it is grown here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Australian farmers and the Australian agricultural sectorâwhich, from memory, is worth $38 billion a year to this countryâcould be very much at risk if we get disease that is currently not here coming into the country. Once that happens, it will decimate some of the growers in this country, so we have a lot of dollars at stake and, just as importantly, the health of our citizens at stake. They quite rightly have an expectation that governments will act in a responsible way to ensure that their health is put at minimum risk. We know that in Australia we have a marketing advantage to both our own consumers and overseas consumers because of our clean green image. It is in our national interest to ensure that that is in no way damaged and that that perception both here and abroad remains intact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the country-of-origin labelling, consumers have a right to know where a product comes from, because, if they at least know where a product comes from, they can also take on board personal responsibility for what they purchase and consume. Many consumers I speak to know full well countries that they would prefer not to buy food from, but they cannot make that choice if the labelling is not clear. We have been calling for that to be made clearer for years and years, and it is good to see that we are slowly moving in that direction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing I want to touch on is this: in Australia when food is produced we have local, state and federal governments all of whom apply health regulations to the production of that food. We have no guarantee that the same processes apply for food that comes from overseas. Even if we do get told that it does, we do not have inspectors at the other end making sure that people are complying in the same way that compliance is met here in Australia. I have been through food producers in Australiaâpacking sheds and real food producers in the cityâand I can assure you I have no qualms at all about buying food from producers that produce in Australia, because I know that they meet their obligations.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="99931" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  I am pleased to speak on the motion moved by the member for Fremantle. I am sure the member for Fremantle is embarrassed to have to bring this on after six long, and somewhat hard, years of the previous Labor government. We know what they did in this area: a duck egg. I am very pleased that the Minister for Agriculture has taken this on and that we are going to have something actually done on the inadequacies of our food labelling after six years of inaction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time available I would like to make what I would say is the free market case to do something on labelling. We know that we often talk about free markets, and it is not that we have absolutely zero government regulations. For the free market to work efficiently, we have prohibitions on coercion, on misuse of market power and on misleading or deceptive conduct. The simple reason that we do so is that, in any market, the more informed a buyer and seller are, the more efficiently a market works. The primary object of our labelling laws should be to ensure that there is nothing misleading about the labelling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at some of the labelling that we allow at the moment. I purchased a packet of frozen raspberries from one of the supermarkets recently. I looked on the side of the packet and it said 'Packed in Australia from imported ingredients'. That is very niceâbut imported from where? That is the question. Firstly, as a consumer, you have the right to know where ingredients are imported from. Secondly, as a food producerâand I speak to someone who has worked for 20 years in designing, producing and marketing consumer productsâor as someone doing anything with food, you simply do not want to have the words 'Produce of China', 'Grown in China' or 'Made in China' on your product, and the reason is that we know that Chinese standards for growing food are less than adequate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have travelled extensively throughout China. I am happy to buy my footwear, my clothing and my electronics from China; but, when it comes to produce that is grown in China, having been to China many times, I will simply pass. If we enable a manufacturer not to disclose the fact that the produce they have in their packets is made in China then the market is simply not working to it most efficient level. There is no pressure on producers in China to improve their standards. If we have efficient and effective labelling which gives the consumer the knowledge that that product is from China, the consumer will only buy that product if there is a substantial discount. So, if there is a substantial discount on their products, companies in China will want to close that gap. There will be market pressure on them to clean up their act. There will be market pressure on them to ensure that they do not use practices such as using raw human sewage as a cheap fertiliser. There will be market pressure on them to extinguish such practices. We have seen this occur with many other consumer products with the label 'Made in China' that were simply seen as being an inferior brand or of inferior quality. The companies have worked to lift their standards with these products. Nowadays, when we see 'Made in China' on most electronic consumer products, it is not seen as a symbol of poor qualityâbut it is still seen that way in health. The Chinese have no incentive to fix their practices unless there is market pressure, and that means full disclosure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue with product labelling is home brand products. We have perhaps one of the most concentrated grocery retail markets anywhere in the world, and this enables the large retailers to have their own home brands. This is an asset transfer from small- and medium-sized businesses to those large retailers. The good will associated with the brand that is on the shelf has been taken away and is now owned by the large retailer. If I am having a home brand product, I want to be able to go from manufacturer to manufacturer to basically use as much market pressure as I can to screw that manufacturer down in price, and so the person who is producing the goods has no good will. If I am able to have a product that looks like it is made in Australia by dressing it up with an Australian company, whether it be Woolworths or Coles, with the label 'Produced in Australia' and if I am able to sneak offshore and source that product from overseas, for instance, from China, without making a full declaration to the consumer then that is misleading and deceptive conduct, and it takes away the good will from Australian manufacturers. This is why the coalition is proudly acting on this issue. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="UK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  I rise to support this motion and strongly endorse the remarks made in relation to it by the members for Fremantle and Makin. This motion follows revelations that certain brands of imported frozen berries grown or packaged in China are suspected of having infected Australians with hepatitis A. All Australians should feel that when they go to their local supermarket the products being sold there are safe and healthy and suitable for consumption. It is apparent to me that imported food currently has an unfair advantage compared with Australian food producers when it comes to food testing and analysis. I have been advised by Ausveg that Australian growers must first subscribe to be a member of a food safety scheme. They are then required to undertake annual audits and regular testing for microbiological issues and chemical residues for at least 100 active ingredients and chemical anolytes. However, only five percent of imports are tested at the borderâfor only 49 chemical residues, as well as for food-labelling issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems to me that if Australian farmers and food producers are required to meet high food safety standards and are to be subject to extensive testing, as they should be, then imported products should have to meet those same criteria before they are stacked on our supermarket shelves. Australian fruit and vegetable growers have said that the failure to test imported berries for hepatitis A and other pathogens, despite outbreaks in recent years across Europe and the United States linked to imported frozen berry products, was absolutely astounding. The deputy chief executive of AUSVEG, Andrew White, stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The system is completely inadequate and needs to be reviewed. Growers are concerned there isn't a level playing field when it comes to imports versus the requirements and quality assurance processes that growers in Australia have to comply with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr White said that lack of testing of imported products was also a problem. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We also think the import testing arrangements need to be reviewed. They are not even testing for microbiological threats. The government has acknowledged this and they are looking to review it, and we support that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I move now to food-labelling issues. I support this motion's intention to improve food-labelling standards to help better inform Australian consumers about where products come from and to encourage consumers to buy Australian made food. Current food-labelling arrangements are weak and confusing. There has been a concern about lack of transparency in labelling laws, about the meaning of the terms 'product of Australia' and 'made in Australia' and how they fit with the 'Made in Australia' and 'Australian Made' logos. The current situation is confusing for consumers. We see qualified claims which state that food is made in Australia 'from a combination of local and imported ingredients'. Again, as the deputy chief executive of AUSVEG, Andrew White, said, the cost of changes to packaging is negligible. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ packaging can be changed very easily. It is not a hard thing to do and it is not costly</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to note the issue of globalisationâthe impact of free trade policies and free trade agreements on our ability to protect ourselves in relation to health and phytosanitary issues. The fact is that free trade fundamentalists have left us vulnerable and exposed, not only in terms of economic issues but in terms of health standardsâa point made recently by Michael Moore of the Public Health Association in the context of the Australia-Pacific free trade deal. He said that this was an issue of potentially great concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to support the remarks made by Tom Elliott on Saturday, 28 February, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span>. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Not that long ago Australians understood that fruit and veg had seasons outside which consumption wasnât possible. In summer we ate apricots, bananas and grapes. By contrast, during winter we turned to apples, pears and mandarins. But since the development of cheap refrigeration and rapid shipping, our eating habits have changed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are going to improve the situation we find ourselves in now, he said, we should accept that not every fruit we enjoy can be obtained year round, that we should try to dine as our forebears didâsparingly and of food which is in seasonâand that we should not be buying stuff grown outside of Australia. We should be checking the labels. Our farmers do their best to conform to extraordinarily high standards of food safety and we should support them in that matter.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="217266" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PRENTICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  I will start by addressing the inaccuracies in the member for Fremantle's motion. Food Standards Australia New Zealand do not require testing, as they do not set the testing regime. Rather, they identify which foods and imports of foodstuffs are considered high risk and then the Department of Agriculture determines the testing regime. Currently, and indeed previously under the Labor-Greens alliance government, those foods deemed high risk are subject to 100 per cent inspection for five shipments, dropping to 25 per cent for 20 shipments and then to five per cent. Unfortunately, berries were not identified as a high-risk item, but I believe that has already been appropriately addressed by the Minister for Agriculture, who has asked Food Standards Australia New Zealand to reassess the risk associated with berries. I cannot support this part of the motion as it is not true. However, local growers are not required by the government to test for chemicals. As everyone knows, there are international standards for allowable limits of chemical residue from pesticides and fertilisers, so the testing that is done is a commercial imperative for growers to be able to ensure their product is fit for market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for the rest of the motion, in 2011 I spoke in this place on this very issue. I spoke about consumers being well and truly tired of guessing where their food comes from. The Blewett report, commissioned by the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council and released on the 28 January 2011, addressed many of the issues we are talking about today. For example, this motion, at (1)(d), states that labelling is confusing regarding country-of-origin labelling. Unlike points (b) and (c) of this motion, that is true. But why is it confusing? The Blewett report, at recommendations 40 and 41 out of 62, asked that country-of-origin laws be extended to include:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That for foods bearing some form of Australian claim, a consumer-friendly, food-specific country-of-origin labelling framework, based primarily on the ingoing weight of the ingredients and components (excluding water), be developed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Four years ago, the ALP-Greens de facto relationship had a chance to address the issue of food-specific country-of-origin labelling. Their response was that they did not support either of the recommendations related to country-of-origin labelling, because it was all a bit too hard. How often has that been the excuse of those oppositeâfood labelling? A bit too hard. Stopping the boats, stopping deaths at sea and keeping children out of detention? A bit too hard. Responsibly managing the economy? A bit too hard. Fortunately for consumers, we now have a government which is not afraid of hard work and is not afraid to make decisions in the national interestâin the interests of all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Minister Joyce said on 26 February, 'People want to know exactly where their food comes from, and this is the government that is going to do it.' Better labelling will be backed up by enhanced screening at the border. The coalition government is strong on border protection and that means biosecurity as well. It will still not be possible to test every single food item that arrives in Australia, but, as I said earlier, the Department of Agriculture has requested that Food Standards Australia New Zealand review the way they identify risk foods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It pays to remember that this is a regime that has served our country well until this incident. There are always risks associated with importing food across great distances, and that is what our border protection forces are trained to deal with. I support the work they do. Over 98 percent of all foods imported are declared clear of disease and other contaminants when they arrive in Australia, according to the imported food inspection data released by the Department of Agriculture. That is a very good pass rate. I believe that consumers can remain confident that the vast majority of imported foods are at the standard we expect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I support the general thrust of this motion, as I did four years ago when the then Labor government rejected them, I must also admonish those opposite for failing to act when they were told by one of their own, Dr Neal Blewett, to do so. I support this motion in principle but reject the cheap partisan politics that characterise this opposition. The coalition government has a good track record in this field, and it is time for Labor to get on board and stop putting politics ahead of the people of Australia.</span>

I had the great pleasure of opening the superclinic on Monday, 16 February. I want to boastâI think that is the word I am looking forâabout this state-of-the-art facility that is now in my electorate and servicing the health needs of the people of Broadmeadows. The Hume GP Super Clinic, as it is known, is the result of a $7 million contribution by the previous federal Labor government. I was very pleased to officiate at this one-stop medical shop, which will have lots of GPs. In particular, it will have an after-hours GP service for my constituents with pathologists, a pharmacy, physiotherapists, podiatrists and occupational therapists. It has been almost three decades in which the people of Broadmeadows have fought long and hard to have, if not a hospital, certainly a significant medical infrastructure such as the Hume GP Super Clinic. So it is my great pleasure and privilege to thank the former CEO, Veronica Jamison, and the chairman of the board, Dr John Hodgson, for their incredible support and dedication and the hard work that went into ensuring that this infrastructure has become a reality in the suburb of Broadmeadows. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  Last Friday morning I had the pleasure of vising Animal Aid in Coldstream in the electorate of Casey. Animal Aid, which has existed for many years, houses dogs and cats and also offers a boarding kennel and a full veterinary practice service. Founded in 1948 by Alexander and Stella Grierson in Croydon, it shifted to Coldstream back in the year 2000 and has done a wonderful service for the community in all of its time. It raises about $500,000 a year so that it can look after lost dogs and cats and provide them new homes. It does so with the active support of a number of donors and many volunteers over the decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Friday, I was pleased to be able to unveil boards of the donors and of the volunteers who have given so much in recognition. I was pleased to see the former member for McEwen, the Hon. Fran Bailey, there. She is the chairman of the board, along with Glenda Walker. I was also pleased to see the number of hardworking staff who do so much, as well as many of the volunteers, some of whom have volunteered for nearly 20 years. I want to pay tribute to all of the staff, volunteers and supporters of Animal Aid in Coldstream.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  Across the four-year span of the Great War there were 849 Fremantle-area men and women who would never return alive. There was also a small band of nurses serving just south of Fremantle who succumbed to the Spanish flu that afflicted soldiers arriving home near the war's end via the quarantine station. Now, a century later, the Fremantle stories of these Australians will be remembered thanks to the dedication of community organisations such as the City of Cockburn RSL sub-branch and the Friends of Woodman Point Recreation Camp. Along with the City of Fremantle, these two driven volunteer based groups were last week the latest in the Fremantle electorate to be awarded Anzac centenary community and local grant funding. The active Cockburn RSL sub-branch will use its $4,880 grant to create a mobile interpretive display that will enhance their ability to educate people about the realities of World War I. A $3,548 grant will allow the Friends of Woodman Point Recreation Camp to develop an exhibition of unseen photographs taken by one of the nurses who served and died at the quarantine station. The City of Fremantle will be able to cover the $30,000 cost of projecting the names of the 849 fallen locals on the city's town hall. These three grants add to the four previously given across the Fremantle electorate. These projects will help us to remember so that the century-old horrors are never repeated.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  I rise today to acknowledge the sad passing of Leigh Bruce 'Tracker' Tilmouth, a staunch Labor supporter and a mighty Territorian. He was a fierce advocate for Aboriginal Australians and will be remembered as an iconic Territorian. Tracker did not have an easy start in life. A member of the stolen generations, he was taken from his family and community and sent to Retta Dixon Home and later to Croker Island.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From these beginnings he went on to have a formative role in establishing the Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service and a local Aboriginal health service in Alice Springs. He served as a director of the Central Land Council and was an outspoken advocate for Aboriginal people right across the Northern Territory and, indeed, here in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He and I did not always agree, especially on political views, but no-one could doubt the strength of his convictions or his selfless commitment. He was not quite 62 years old, but his footprint on history is out of all proportions to his years. May he rest in peace. As I said, he will be remembered as an outstanding iconic Territorian and will be sorely missed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  The New South Wales North Coast is such a great place to live but, as locals know, there is a threat posed to everything we have and this is from harmful coal seam gas mining. I have made my position very clear on this issue. I do not support coal seam gas mining and other unconventional gas mining activities within our region. With the coming state election in New South Wales, I am very pleased that New South Wales Labor's election policy is also very clear. Labor will ban harmful coal seam gas mining and unconventional gas mining activities across the North Coast of New South Wales.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, it is shameful that North Coast National Party representatives have announced their support for a pro-fracking gas plan. In fact, the National Party's CSG policy puts at risk existing clean and green businesses like tourism, agriculture and food production. It is shameful that National Party MPs like Thomas George, Geoff Provest and candidate Kris Beavis and their Liberal-National government have a pro-CSG expansion policy that will put harmful CSG wells into our valleys, farmlands and villages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the state election on 28 March, I am proud to be supporting our great Labor candidates on the North Coast. The choice is very clear. Labor's policy is to ban CSG in our region, whereas the National Party's agenda is to expand harmful coal seam gas mining. That is why no-one trusts the National Party. So on 28 March I am asking the people of northern New South Wales to vote Labor for a gas field free North Coast.</span>

They are closing hospitals, they are closing emergency departments and they are closing courts, but they still always manage to find money for a taxpayer-funded advertising campaign against the federal government. They have just announced and started running their fourth campaign in the last yearâagain, it is a massive wasteâthis time telling pensioners that they will be seeing an increase in their council rates and blaming it on the federal government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My message to local pensioners is very simple: please do not let the state Labor government make you stressed or worried about your council rate concessions. This scare campaign is simply untrue and it is going nowhere. What is more, the state government is fully aware there is no chance that their cut to pensioners' council rate concessions will ever happen. The state Liberals, Family First, the Greens, Dignity for Disabled and Independent John Darley are all uniting to block this cut in the upper House. The only people in South Australia who will be voting in favour of cutting concessions to pensioners for local government rates are the Labor Party and they do not have the numbers in the state upper House. The cut is finished; it is dead in the water. Why cause pensioners so much stress and worry for no reason? This is politics at its worstâscaring pensioners for no reason other than to score cheap political points. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  I want to pay tribute to a great local hero, Phil Wilson, who sadly passed away after a short illness. Phil dedicated an amazing 60 years of service to the Oakleigh District Football Club, starting with the under-16s in 1957, playing in the under-17s as seniorsâboth football and cricketâbeing a secretary of the juniors and the seniors, being a life member of the club in 1969, being a life member of the Federal Football League in 1981 and being on the club committee from 1968 to 2010âan amazing record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phil passed away in relative comfort, I am advised by club stalwarts, with a small number of both his familiesânatural and clubâin attendance. True to the end, he never complained or had a negative or bad word about anyone, or anything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His service was held in Oakleigh, of course, and was attended by approximately 350 people, many from the club and surrounding football leagues. I am advised that the wake was a massive affair, with everybody going back to the club. Phil's niece spoke of his love of family and the club and, as a bachelor, it was thought that he was more or less married to the club. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were also many people representing lots of clubs, the football community and the broader Oakleigh community where Phil is a legend. The club unveiled a photo along with his commemorative service record and a large sign renaming the bar as the Phil E Wilson Barâa nice touch, and one I am sure Phil would appreciate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phil was a naturally shy and retiring type but we managed to have a service for him before he went so we could actually say these things to him in person. I want to say thank you to a tremendous member of our community for a life of service. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to particularly acknowledge the year 8 and 9 honours students from North Lakes State College whom I joined on Friday, 27 February 2015 to clean up around their school. They did a wonderful job. I wish to acknowledge Miss Elyse Lucas and Miss Lisa Matthews who organised this event. I found the students very engaging and caring for their environment in a great way. It was fantastic to see them enjoying themselves.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday on Sunday, 1 March Clean Up Australia Day happened right across the nation, and the North Lakes Lions Club put on a local event organised by Debby Burgess. I also had the chance to join the club help clean up the lakes around North Lakes. They joined thousands of people around the countryâlast year there was something like 570,000 people at over 7,000 sites removing over 15,500 tonnes of rubbish that otherwise would have gone into our creeks, our rivers, our dams and the environment. I want to thank every one of them for what they did.</span>

Ron has had an enormous impact on the Labor Party and his decades of service and volunteering in his community and for the party has made Footscray a better place to live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ron is a lifelong member of the Labor party and has been involved in the Labor movement for over 40 years. He was the campaign director in Gellibrand for former Labor members Hector McIvor, Ralph Willis and Nicola Roxon, and he authorised my initial communications.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Incredibly, Ron will celebrate his 90th birthday this year, having never lost an electionâthat is a tradition that I continue to uphold in this place and intend to do so for some time into the future. During that time Ron really has seen it all. He remembers watching a future Prime Minister Bill Shorten come up through the ranks of Young Labor in the area</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ron is synonymous with Footscray and the area. He was Footscray Citizen of the Year in 1992. He has received the Western Hospital Community Service Award, Maribyrnong Council Community Service Award, Footscray Rotary Club Community Award and the Salvation Army Service Award.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He is also a past president of the West Footscray Rotary Club, the Footscray Historical Society and the Footscray RSL. He is an Australian Centenary Medal winner and the Order of Australia recipient and has won many other prizes. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He served his country in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific during the Second World War. He is an exceptional man. I thank him for all he has done for the local Labor Party. My community in Footscray would not be the same without him, and I hope that he can give many more decades of service to the party in the future.</span>

In 1991, Panthers won their first grand finalâyet again, Year of the Goat. In 2003, Panthers also won the grand finalâagain, Year of the Goat.</span>

Go the Panthers.</span>

Each year 1,400 Australian women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Over 1,000 women will die from the disease each year. On average three women are diagnosed each day. There is currently no reliable detection screening for ovarian cancer. There is a lot of false information about ovarian cancer and how you can determine whether or not you have it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  I wish to speak about a road in the Canning electorate that has caused many traffic accidents during my time in parliament. Denny Avenue in Kelmscott, where it intersects with Streich Avenue, is dangerous for both motorists and pedestrians alike due to poor planning and a high volume of through traffic. This intersection joins two major arterial roads in Kelmscott: Albany Highway and Railway Avenue, so named because a train line also passes through this intersection. Bordering this intersection is the Kelmscott train station, the newly built Spudshed and the Kelmscott shopping plaza. Denny Avenue is less than 200 metres long, so it is not hard to see why this intersection is fraught with danger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week the <span style="font-style:italic;">Armadale Examiner</span> featured a story about this intersection on its front page. The story outlined that, due to the dangerous nature of the intersection, a local resident has started an online petition to draw attention to the need for drastic action. I have raised this matter many times with the City of Armadale and multiple ministers for transport on behalf of my concerned constituentsâthe current minister, Dean Nalder, should take notice of this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I have always received a response outlining future plans for the intersection, it is my understanding that a long-term, sustainable solution has not been approved. To further illustrate the need for immediate change, I regretfully inform the House of a traffic accident at the intersection of Denny Avenue and Albany Highway yesterday that tragically resulted in a fatality. I take this opportunity to call upon the Minister for Transport, Dean Nalder, and Main Roads Western Australia to once and for all adequately address this issue.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has released the first quarterly petrol report for the year. I welcome Minister for Small Business Mr Bruce Billson's direction to the ACCC to do this targeted monitoring of the fuel industry. The report is particularly relevant for motorists in regional Australia. I have been inundated with constituent inquiries calling for the ACCC to investigate fuel pricing behaviour, particularly in Indi. Prices have remained too high for too long and are not coming down as predicted. This first report has shown that regional townships have a fuel price 20c per litre higher than their urban counterparts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Benalla, in my electorate of Indi, was featured in the latest report. In January 2015 in Benalla, on average prices were 19.6c a litre higher than in the city. Motorists are not happy, and they want answers. I have submitted a series of questions to Mr Billson to ask how we can work towards fairer outcomes for rural and regional motorists. This issue has gone on for decades and people in the country really have had enough. I call on the government and my colleagues opposite to help me to get this investigated and to introduce solutions to make fuel prices in regional Australia fairer for all motorists.</span>

This fantastic showcase has called Townsville home all those years. From very humble beginnings, it has become a natural part of Townsville's fabric. It forms part of our identity as a city with a vibrant arts sector and a city which is more than just about sporting excellence. AFCM CEO Sue Hackett and artistic director Piers Lane will be here later this month for the festival's national launch.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Piers Lane is one of the world's great pianists and personifies what this festival is all about. Piers has strong family connections to Innisfail. While Innisfail is probably more famous in this country for sugar, sugar cane, Kerry Boustead, Pat Ernst and Billy Slater, it is Piers Lane who treads the world stage with the love of the north in his heart.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Far from performing a series of formal concerts, the AFCM has taken its international artists throughout the north from underground mines in the west to the beaches of Palm Island. They generously conduct masterclasses for students of all of our great cities and regions. Piers, with his patent shoes and multi-coloured socks, brings together a program which is not just musical excellence but fun and laughter which is accessible to all of is.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The arts litter Townsville's calendar, with Perc Tucker Regional Gallery and Umbrella Studio among those playing a part. I congratulate the Townsville City Council and Townsville Enterprise for promoting our vibrant arts centre. The festival runs from 31 July until 8 August. It is for all of us, and all are welcome.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is somewhat of a contradiction that Baha'i followers are being persecuted in the very country where the faith originated and where, in the past, it was a very much respected religion. I particularly noted the commitment Baha'i followers have to education for all, and their establishment of a network of universities around the world. Only by exposing violations of human rights wherever they occur do we bring hope to the persecuted and bring light to their lives. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the night there were hundreds of people in attendance at the filmâmany of them Baha'i followers, but not all. It was good to see the broad community support for their struggles in Iran right now, and I hope that the release of the film in Adelaide is only the beginning of it being shown throughout Australia where, again, it might also expose what is happening, and bring further light to those being persecuted in Iran right now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that the US has placed the highest priority on the Avalon air show. It only records the same priority to two other air shows globally. That shows where Australia stands in terms of the US view of the strength of our relationship and the importance that the US places on itâand, indeed, on our defence industry. </span>

We have some of the highest technology in the world, which we can sell to the rest of the world. Ramping up on that technology will obviously significantly benefit both our defence industry and our defence capability in the long run.</span>

The $3,500 grant will be used to erect a plaque memorialising the contribution of Maltese Australian soldiers in World War I as a part of the commemoration of hundred years of ANZAC. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a particularly interesting wartime connection with Malta, and it is a wonderful example of the often untold story of our multicultural forces. Eight hundred Maltese citizens worked as contractors under Maltese officers at Gallipoli. In addition to that, 40 Maltese men, who had immigrated to Australia, fought with the Australian Imperial Forces during World War I. Of those 40 Maltese soldiers, seven died in action, including one on Anzac Beach on 25 April 1915. </span>

Another plaque and honour board will be on display at the Maltese Resource Centre in Parramatta. This, of course, would not be possible without the dedication of the Maltese ex-servicemen's association, in particular Andrew Jospeh and Charles Mifsud, who have dedicated their time to ensure that the service and sacrifice of our Maltese Australian soldiers is not forgotten.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  On the weekend, tragedy struck at a small country cricket field, Karramomus, when batsman Vino Kumar suffered a life-threatening heart attack. He was standing at the non-strikers end and he collapsed, but what happened next was a true show of great Australian spirit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Opposing players from the Murchison Cricket Club moved quickly to Vino's aid. Two Murchison cricketers, Darryn Rowney and Bryce Wellington, knew exactly what to do and rolled Vino into the recovery position. After just a few minutes, however, Vino's breathing became weaker and he eventually stopped breathing, so Darryn and Bryce immediately began CPR. The cricket club had called the ambulanceâof course quite a distance awayâand they were on their way to this place while Darryn and Bryce continued the life-saving CPR.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When both firefighters and ambulance crews arrived, they continued working to save Vino, eventually stabilising him and transporting him to the Goulburn Valley base hospital. He was then transferred to St Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne and is recovering. From all reports he will be well againâhopefully well enough to play cricket. The president of Karramomus Cricket Club, Paul Trevaskis, and Vino's team captain, Ash Hooper, then drove Mrs Kumar to Melbourne to be at her husband's side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />These actions show the true meaning of sportsmanship, comradery and, above all else, our love and compassion for one another. Two games of cricket were abandoned at that time and no-one complained. It was all about supporting Vino Kumar and his family. I want to congratulate everyone involved. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  I rise to alert the House to the launch today of a report through the Butterfly Foundation for eating disorders entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Investing in need</span>. This report goes to the opportunities for funding health care and support for people suffering from eating disorders and the real opportunities to make savings. The study itself was originally funded under the previous Labor government, although that was not pointed out today, but it does make some very important points.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eating disorders are expensive conditions. It can cost more than $100,000 to appropriately treat a person with anorexia nervosa. EDs are also long lasting and debilitating conditions. For example, if someone has AN for a decade, the cost of their forgone productivity and other financial costs could be greater than $200,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This study provides an important opportunity for government to consider the question of expending money now for savings in the future. This relates to the premise behind putting a fence at the top of the cliff, rather than dealing with people at the bottom of the cliff after they have had the accident. The estimation is that the benefits of interventions, as outlined throughout this report, could outweigh the costs by a factor of more than five to one. The government should consider very seriously dealing with what is a very serious issue in the Australian community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  This Saturday I will have the pleasure of being in Yamba to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the local Yamba CWA. It started on 6 March 1945. The current secretary, Leonie Saunders, and treasurer, Raylene Blood, do a great job. They have 17 active members: Dr Elizabeth Allworth, Christine Bowden, Elaine Brew, Libby Cotter, Sandra Douglas, Josephine Edgar, Ione Elphinstoneâwho is their oldest member and who turned 95 today, so, happy birthdayâCarolyn Fox, Pat Halliday, Nyssa Lesniak, Alice Nott, Yvonne Smithson, Joan White, Gay Wiseman and Bev Wilson. I congratulate them all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, the CWA is the largest women's organisation in Australia. It aims to improve conditions for women and children in regional areas. The Yamba branch supports an adopted child in Grafton who is handicapped. They have raised money to fit out a car to make it wheelchair friendly. They also raise money for local school and end-of-year prizes and raise money that goes to head office, which offers scholarships. Each year, the club studies a country and this year it is Italy. Again, I wish the Yamba CWA a very happy 70th birthday and I look forward to celebrating on Saturday morning what they have done in our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  I spent an amazing Saturday night in the member for Bruce's electorate at the Dandenong Basketball Stadium to watch the under-20 men's final between Victoria and Tasmania. It was a gripping match and one that went down to the wire. It went into double-overtime, ending with a score of 105-104. In the middle of the game the power went out because of an electrical storm, and we had to sit there for a while waiting for the lights to come on. I was there in the capacity of a family member, watching my nephew Matthew McCarthy on the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an amazing event. I want to put on record a big shout out to the Victorians, who took a clean sweep of this national championship, winning all four of the events on record, taking out the men's under-20, against Tasmania, and the women's under-20, against WA. There was also the Ivor Burge metro men's and women's teams. These are teams for people with intellectual disabilities. Again, Victoria won both the men's and the women's. Amazing. The women's overcame New South Wales in a great final game, and the men's defeated Japan, an overseas visiting team. A big shout out, and thank you to all those involved in this amazing tournament. To the players, coaches and referees and, most particularly the parents, a big thank you for the efforts you make on behalf of your kids participating in a sport they love. The kids are driven all around the state to get to these events. It was a terrific event and it was sad that it was not covered by anybody. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  As I was saying before the suspension, the relocation of the West Coast Eagles facilities to my electorate of Swan in the suburb of Lathlain will be an economic and community boost and a social impact boost for the area of Lathlain as well. Already in anticipation of the move we have seen a rise in housing prices and we have seen the town of Victoria Park focusing on redirecting infrastructure funding to that area to ensure not only that the facilities are well enhanced but also that the area surrounding it gets the full benefit of having a $70 million project. So, to the West Coast Eagles, a proud AFL club that has won three premierships in the 28 years, congratulations. I wish them luck with their efforts.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  I want to talk today about trains. In country Australia trains are essential. They need to be reliable, they need to be safe, they need to run on time and they need to be clean. We have a real problem with our train between Melbourne and Albury. It does not run on time, it is often not clean, and sometimes it becomes a bus. Last week we had the horrible story of Tehya Hanley, an 18-year-old award-winning student, who could not get to Melbourne when she needed to. But the worst thing about all this was the excuse. When we contacted ARTC, the Australian Rail Track Corporation, they told us there was a signal fault and that they could not ensure that signal problems will not happen again. Well, in this House today I say to you, ARTC: that is not good enough. Our train systems need to be able to rely on the signals, and the signals need to be reliable. I call on the government to investigate this problem. I call on ARTC to report to us. We need to be able to rely on our signals, our trains and our public transport.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">1. Our Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, and Members of his Government, for the principled and moral stand taken hitherto concerning its continuing recognition of, and strong support for, the modem State of Israel.</span>

Maintain its clear stance that any peace agreement - and solution to the current ongoing conflict - MUST be achieved through direct negotiations between Israel and Palestinian representatives, and NOT through a unilateral recognition of a "Palestinian state."</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The petition I have tabled expresses appreciation to the Prime Minister and members of his government for the principled and moral stand taken on the recognition of and support for the modern state of Israel. The petition also calls on the House to encourage the government to recognise officially that the Arab Palestinian people manifestly failed to meet the conditions of statehood under international law and that Palestinian leaders regularly use incitement in calling specifically for the obliteration of Israel consistent with the charter of Hamas. The petitioners also call on the House to encourage the government to lead the way in supporting a one-state solution, that being the democratic Jewish state of Israel.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said, I have tabled that petition. It was signed by 3,625 individuals, and I think it is something that we do need to consider. There has been this viewpoint dominant in international affairs that only a two-state solution is worthy of consideration when it comes to Israel. Israel is a beacon in that area of the world. It is democratic. There are rights extended to minorities. And it could be that a one-state solution is the solution to peace in the Middle East.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

It is not in accordance with the rules but it is basically a copy of the same petition.</span>

That day was an outstanding success, with over 100 seniors in attendance. The first speaker was Lake Macquarie Council, and they talked about early warning networks and household emergency plans. That was Jenny Lincoln-Webb and Jackie Korbel. Warren Gilbertson, from the New South Wales Law Society, gave his usual outstanding contribution and provided information on wills, power of attorney and other relevant legal matters. We did something a little bit different this time. We had Kylie from the local pharmacy come along and talk about medications. In addition, we had Deborah Moore the Heart Foundationâand the shadow minister, who is here, participated in that at one of my forums. We also had the University of the Third Age. Robin Maclean, from Centrelink, spoke, as did Australian Hearing's Linda Brindle. New South Wales Police Senior Constable Shamala Whitehead gave a presentation on scams. It was an outstanding day. Everybody learnt a lot. It was one of those days where you have absolutely no politics, just a lot of information. So people went away with information about services that are available in the community.</span>

Over the last six years of government, we had a welfare bill that exploded out of control and was never tempered with common sense. Of course, McClure has picked up the mantle and, for the second time in a decade, reported to the government about ways to simplify the system down to five basic payments and four simple supplementsâfor carers, kids, education and housingâto replace the scores of supplements that we have had up until this time. But ultimately the one great missing piece in this puzzle is the 130,000 Australian kids who leave school every year unable to even pick up a broom or get a job. We must do better than that, as we must do for the 150,000 who transfer from youth allowance to Newstart every year once they hit the appropriate age. These are the great failings in our welfare and employment system, and they must be addressed. The great underused area of work experience, tapping into our fantastic private sector and its ability to give small business opportunities to young people, must be a priority. Last year we trebled the number of jobs created in this country. Last year 21,000 new small businesses were created. We need to reach out to them and give them opportunities to employ young people and give them a start. Work experience gives us that opportunity and both sides of politics should support it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It was a project put forward by St Brendan's Catholic school. What they are doing is establishing a remembrance wall and garden at the school to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Anzac landing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The project will be ready in time for Anzac Day in April, and the staff at St Brendan's have put a lot of thought into their project to commemorate the Anzac centenary. It will feature several large, framed portraits of local diggers who served in World War I. They will form a remembrance wall in the school hall and will be supported by a multimedia display of an exhibition of student art. A remembrance garden will also be established to honour the achievements and sacrifice of all servicemen and women during World War I. A commemorative Anzac book will be produced for all school families, local RSL members and families of local diggers. The project is a great way to involve students and to teach them about their Anzac history and Anzac spirit. It will also help to put a human perspective on the events and impact of World War I. It will be a lasting legacy for the school and for the wider community. I congratulate St Brendan's Catholic College on this outstanding project.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  Many a good story starts on a dark and stormy night, and mine is no exception. Imagine walking your city streets after midnight on a Friday night. It is pouring rain, people are flowing out of the clubs and drunks are stumbling down the street. There is a young person lying on the footpath in front of a shop. He is overly intoxicated and needs to go home, but he is too much under the weather to move himself. That is what I saw late one stormy night in February when I joined Carol Christopher, the senior chaplain and program director, and Rachel Le Poidevin, who is a volunteer, of Cairns Streets Chaplains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The story is typical of young people enjoying themselves, having a little too much to drink and becoming vulnerableâof course through their intoxicationâto assault or robbery. It is certainly a drain on police resources. But not in Cairns, where the street chaplains walk the streets of our CBD looking out for those who have partied just a little bit too hard. Chaplains will either escort them to a taxi or hang around until they can be picked up by their mum, or their family or, in more serious cases, the ambulance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since starting in October 2013, the street chaplains have had a profound impact on our city. Between 2013 and 2014 crime rates in our CBD have dropped by nine per cent and the street chaplains should certainly claim a lot of credit for this. It is absolutely amazing. I would like to thank them for their valuable service and look forward to going out with them again on another night in Cairns, working with them to look after our young people.</span>

St Mary's will establish a commemorative garden at the school which will be a focal point for the Anzac Day and remembrance services in the future. The garden will feature rosemary bushes and Gallipoli rosesâplants which have been grown from seeds taken from Gallipoli after the battles. It will also feature red sculptured poppies to reflect the original Flanders poppy fields; together with life-size Anzac soldier silhouettes as a reminder of the service and sacrifice of our diggers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was delighted to go along and launch the project at St Mary's Catholic School earlier this month. The funds have been allocated from the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. The new garden will be a great addition to the school and will be a lasting legacy for the whole of the school. It will be a fitting memorial to the hundredth anniversary of World War I. Parents, teachers and students will all help with the garden. The local Men's Shed will also help out with the sculptures of the poppies. This is a fantastic project and an excellent way to remember the contributions of Australian soldiers at Gallipoli.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  Today I would like to raise the issue of one of the very simplistic slogans involving the failed ideology of the Moorebank Intermodal: it is taking freight off road and putting it on rail. This at first sounds like a wonderful idea, because steel on steel is much more efficient than rubber on bitumen. In fact, you use about 50 per cent of the diesel fuel to transport a container via rail than you do via road. Many people quickly jumped to the conclusion that this will reduce emissions of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span>, but they failed to understand what it does to the emissions of particulate matter. There is already particulate matter in Western Sydney, and the dirt and sootâmainly from diesel trucksâis estimated to kill 1,400 people in Sydney every year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that this is a failed plan is that, at the moment, with modern truck enginesâcompared to the dirty old diesel engines that they were usingâwe get 18 times more particulate matter spewing out of a diesel train than comes from a modern truck engine. So even though we were halving the amount of diesel fuel we were using, we are burning that diesel fuel 18 times worse, which means that we are getting a ninefold increase in particulate matter. In Western Sydney we already have particulate matters above World Health Organisation standards, and this plan will just make it worse. If we are going to do this, we need to bring in standards on our rail network, the same as we do for our trucks in urban areas.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about 21,000 signatures of a total of 72,000 to 73,000 signatures, known as the Monster Climate Petition, which has been coordinated by 12 very significant Australian women. The lead petitioner is Dr Fiona Stanley, a very well-known Australian figureâAustralian of the Year a little more than a decade ago and a great public figure in the area of public health and an advocate of the links between health policy and climate change policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This petition was inspired by a much earlier petition conducted by women in 1891 who, in Victoria, collected almost 30,000 signatures in five weeks requesting the vote for women. In accordance with that historical inspiration, this petition was done in old-school fashion. It was done on paper by pen. It is not one of those new online petitions that are very easy for people to log on and ramp the numbers up quickly. This was hard work for those petitioners, and they have done an extraordinary job. They delivered the first batchâthe final batch being tabled by me todayâjust before Christmas, in December last year, out the front of Parliament House. The other two-thirds of the petition were tabled by the member for Indi and also the member for Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lead petitioners decided to extend the petition until August 2015 in light of the importance of 2015 in climate change policy and climate change politics and, I think to their mind, also to be able to continue to raise consciousness across the Australian community about the importance of this year in this policy area. This year, 2015, will be a very big year in climate change policy and climate change politics. Whatever your view about this area of policyâa very highly contested area of policyâwe know there will be a great deal of activity domestically here in Australia and internationally leading into the Paris conference in December 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are only several weeks into this year, but the year has already started with a bang. Shortly after New Year's Day, our third largest export partner, South Korea, started an emissions trading scheme very similar in design to the emissions trading scheme that the Labor Party argued for in parliament through the course of last yearâthe same emissions trading scheme we took to the election in 2013. Already, only several weeks into the emissions trading scheme in South Korea, the permits that big polluters are required to purchase in order to continue to emit carbon dioxide are trading at about the same price that Treasury advised us the Labor Party's emissions trading scheme would trade at. Again, this about the same price that similar permits are being traded in the European Union ETS and about the same price of some of the more mature emissions trading schemes in China, which now has eight schemes. For example, Shenzhen is being traded on their market as well. Again, it shows a very significant momentum around the world for market based mechanisms that blend the idea of a formal legal cap on carbon pollution that then lets business work out the cheapest and most effective way to operate it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also this year, contrary to the commentary that comes through in the broadsheets particularly like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>âthe world if anything is getting cooler according to Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister's senior business adviser, Maurice Newmanâwe were advised by that well-known hotbed of left-wing conspiracies, NASA, that 2014 was actually the hottest year in the 135 years in which records have been kept of surface temperatures around the world. And 14 of the 15 hottest years have all been in the last 15 years. Indeed, we have not yet got the global temperature records for February 2015 but it is likely that February 2015 will be the 360th month in a row in which the global average surface temperatures were higher than the 20th-century average thereby putting a lie to the suggestion that everything is okay and that if there was some warming over the course of the 20th century it is all reversed. We know that is not the case at all.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">President Obama in his State of the Union Address only a couple of weeks ago reinforced and demonstrated his commitment to make sure that the United States, as the largest economy in the world and one of the two largest polluters of carbon dioxide in the world, will continue to do all that he can as president of that country to achieve an ambitious agreement in Paris in December 2015. He said in his State of the Union Address:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see a very significant building of momentum towards the conference in December in Paris.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The year 2014 was a study in contrast. We saw that sort of momentum building around the world with a very significant agreement between the two largest polluters, the two largest economies in the world, the United States and China. The presidents of both countries indicated commitments that they intended to table many months before the Paris conference of December. The United States has committed to a reduction in carbon pollution in the order of 24 to 26 per cent on 2005 levels by 2025, which the Climate Institute indicated is about the equivalent to a 30 per cent commitment here in Australia. And China committed to peak and then reduce its carbon pollution levels by 2030 at the latest. That comes on the back of other significant commitments made by some of our oldest trading partners, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and many others as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The picture in Australia could not have been more different. In this country we have a Prime Minister dedicated to slamming Australia into reverse in this area of policy. Over the course of last year, the cap on carbon pollution that would then let business work out the cheapest and most effective way to operateâthe discipline on our carbon pollution levelsâwas removed from the statute books by this Prime Minister. This Prime Minister also removed our legal target to reduce carbon pollution levels in the relatively short term by 2020 and in the longer term by 2050. There are now no legal commitments to undertake any reduction in carbon pollution levels because of the decisions taken by this Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps most notably in most shamefully there was an outrageous attack and ambush on the renewable energy sector. In spite the fact that this Prime Minister went to the last two elections promising to keep the existing Renewable Energy Target, which in the large-scale sector was 41,000 gigawatt hours electricity by 2020. In spite of a clear promise to keep that in place, he then launched a shameful ambush on the sector with devastating consequences at the beginning of 2014.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen is that going from opposition in 2013 when Australia was one of the foremost attractive countries on the face of the earth to invest in renewable energy, up with the powerhouse economies of China, the United States and Germany, we have plummeted to 10th. Over the course of 2014 renewable energy investment around the world expanded by 16 per cent; in a country like China it expanded by 32 per cent. But in Australia, in the large-scale sector, it plummeted by 88 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, 2015 will be a very interesting year domestically for climate change policy. This Prime Ministerâif he lasts over the course of this yearâhas commissioned, after a deal he did with Clive Palmer and the Palmer United Party, a report from the Climate Change Authority. The report, to be delivered in June, is about what sort of position Australia should take about post-2020 reductions in carbon pollution levels. It will be a very interesting response indeed from this Prime Minister once that report has been delivered. Expert after expert has indicated that the government's policy of so-called 'direct action' is utterly incapable of achieving meaningful reductions in carbon pollution, and if there were to be any significant reductions in carbon pollution they would come at the cost of billions and billions and billions of taxpayers' dollars. I want to congratulate the petitioners of the Monster Climate Petition and to applaud their work.</span>

                  <a href="DYN" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr JENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  Today there are too many questions surrounding science funding, policy and direction. The $20 billion Medical Research Fund, for exampleâis it going to be general or specifically targeting cancer and Alzheimer's? How are we going to source those researchers? Long lead times are required, and what are we saying to those who want to become mathematicians, physicists or chemistsâhard sciences that are already in crisis? The PM asked me to draw up recommendations on science to improve the area. I consulted widely, and these recommendations are now up on my website for anyone who wishes to see them. I am concerned that we are not putting in place policy to improve science; that we are putting disincentives in place for people who might consider careers in the hard sciences and maths.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There appears to be a lack of understanding of how science works. Many advances, including in the medical field, are not the result of directed research, but arise out of more fundamental research that was not directedâX-rays, CT scans and radiotherapy for cancer came from fundamental physics. Magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, also came from fundamental physics. These were not the results of some effort coordinated by government to achieve a specific breakthrough; they were the results of work driven by a quest for knowledge and understanding that had fortuitous benefits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider that one-third of the world's economy today is based on the work of what some would consider obscure physicists, who were mainly German, in the first quarter of the 20th centuryânearly a century ago. Here I am talking about quantum physics and the resulting solid-state electronics which resulted from the fundamental insights. Consider 19th century physicist Michael Faraday who, when asked by then-Chancellor of the Exchequer, William Gladstone, about what value electricity had, replied: 'Why sir, there is every possibility that you will soon be able to tax it.' Consider general relativity, without which an accurate GPS system would be impossible. How could Einstein have known these applications at the time? How could a government have directed research to that end? One need look no further than Australia, where wi-fi came about as a result of radio astronomy researchâas a result of a failed experiment into finding atomic-sized mini black holes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the science and research industry there are many other ways the government can, and should, participate: by being a customer, by funding early stage R&amp;D, by using the bully pulpit to get reticent consumers to trust well-tested technology and by funding an infrastructure bank that uses low-cost government money for well-proven but low-risk technologies. Governments have always been lousy at predicting winners and they are likely to become more so as legions of entrepreneurs and tinkerers swap designs online, turn them into products at home and market them globally from a garage. The investment architecture is important. How our government treats capital gains can be crucially important to nascent technologies and industries. It can prove the cheap hand up. Cutting capital gains taxes and rewarding long-term commitments will help innovation and invention in Australia. Research and development has much to gain from simple and relatively cheap tinkering at the edges of capital gains tax and superannuation systems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Science, and research and development can and often does offer attractive returns to investors. If one thinks government should pick winners, take the NBN as a reality check. Governments have no ability at picking and choosing value-adding projects and, likewise, areas for research. Similarly, there is no way of knowing how knowledge will be commercialised in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Physician Marcia Angell has shown that many of the most promising new drugs trace their origins to research done by the taxpayer-funded National Institutes of Health in the US, which has an annual budget of some $30 billion. Private pharmaceutical companies, meanwhile, tend to focus more on the D than the R part of R&amp;D, plus slight variations of existing drugs and marketing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider the iPhone. It is often heralded as the quintessential example of what happens when a hands-off government allows genius entrepreneurs to flourish and yet the development of the features that make the iPhone a smartphone rather than a stupid phone was publicly funded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The progenitor of the internet was the ARPANET, a program funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agencyâwhich is part of the United States Department of Defenseâin the 1960s. GPS began as a 1970s US military program called Navstar.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The iPhone's touchscreen technology was created by the company FingerWorks, which was founded by a professor at the publicly funded University of Delaware and one of his doctoral candidates, who received grants from the National Science Foundation and the CIA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None of this suggests that Steve Jobs and his team at Apple were not brilliant in how they put together existing technologies. The problem, however, is that failing to admit the public side of the story puts future government-funded research at risk. State spending on innovation tends to be assessed in exactly the wrong way. Under the prevailing economic framework, market failures are identified and particular government investments are proposed. Their value is then appraised through a narrow calculation that involves heavy guesswork: will the benefits of a particular intervention exceed the costs associated with both the offending market failure and the implementation of the fix? Such a method is far too static to evaluate something as dynamic as innovation. By failing to account for the possibility that the state can create economic landscapes that never existed before, it gives short shrift to governments' efforts in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This incomplete way of measuring public investment leads to accusations that, by entering certain sectors, governments are crowding out private investment. That charge is often false, because government investment often has the effect of 'crowding in,' meaning that it stimulates private investment and expands the overall pie of national output, which benefits both private and public investors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In sum, scientists should not try to game the system and they should not be reduced to rent seeking. Research and scientific curiosity should not be dictated by politically hot topics. The 80-20 public-private money equation for research is distracting scientists and preventing them from getting on with their key competencies and important work. This is because ARC funding only funds 80 per cent of a research project. It is the equivalent of a brickie being required to spend 20 per cent of his time on wiring. Different skill sets lead to suboptimal results. Everyone loses. We need mission-oriented policies that foster interactions among multiple fields. It is time to fund imagination. It is time to invest in unintended consequences. And it is time to invest in known unknowns and, almost more importantly, unknown unknowns.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:20</span>):  In North Parramatta there is a phenomenal colonial heritage precinct that rivals any in Australia by far. It is truly, truly amazing. It is just a short walk from the CBD. And it currently is in danger, thanks to Bruce Baird and UrbanGrowth's plans to overdevelop the site with buildings of between six and 50 storeys high right up against the base of some of our most significant convict heritage buildings. There are more historical buildings in the North Parramatta precinct than there are in the Rocks, by far. The precinct contains Australia's first Female Convict Factory. It contains a number of buildings from the 1700s which are very rare in Australia and in fact Parramatta. That region has the three that are in existence in this area. It contains a group of buildings including the Female Convict Factory and the Parramatta Girls Home that records the history of women, particularly the incarceration of women, for 200 years of settlement. It also borders the World Heritage listed Old Government House and falls within its vistas, which are covered by the World Heritage listing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The precinct nestles on the banks of Parramatta River. In 167 hectares of mainly hospital land it houses the current Cumberland Hospital, with a number of single- and two-storey buildings surrounded by extensive large areas of open space where the residents, both from the hospital and from community accommodation, currently wander. At the north is the Parramatta Gaol, an extraordinary collection of sandstone buildings built in 1835 and arguably, with one other town claiming the status, the oldest existing jail in Australia. It is on the banks of Darling Mills Creek, which runs along the north side of the precinct. If you follow that creek along for about a kilometre you reach the place where it joins Toongabbie Creek to form the Parramatta River. That is the location where Governor Phillip landed just a few weeks after the settlement in Sydney Cove. He went up the river looking for farmland and landed there at the confluence of the Parramatta River and then walked down the riverbank recording in his diaries as he went, until he found the location that he identified for the spot for Australia's Government House. When you look across the river, there is the wisteria garden from 1866 and the oldest building in Australia, which is Australia's Government House. If you turn around and look back towards the site you will see the old Female Convict Factory, commissioned by Governor Macquarie from his residence in Old Government House and designed by Francis Greenwayâolder and far more intact than the World Heritage listed Cascade Convict Factory in Tasmaniaâand surrounded by 67 other heritage buildings in the precinct. In the middle of the 167 hectares is the Cumberland Hospital, a mental health facility built around what was the lunatic asylum, as it was called at the time, that used the old convict factory buildings when it was closed in 1848.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an extraordinary location and part of a larger historical area of Parramatta, including the girls' orphanage at Rydalmere, where the female children of the convicts were kept, and the Elizabeth Macarthur farm in Harris Park. If you go there you will be on land that has been in public hands since colonisation. You will see trees planted in the early days of settlement as a botanic garden. You will walk through the old sports oval, with its heritage listed pavilion, and you will see Bethelâa little dolls' house, a gorgeous little two-storey building that was Australia's first children's hospital and forms part of the Roman Catholic orphanage grounds, where the Catholic children of the convict women were housed once they were removed from their parents at the age of two, back in the convict days. It was later used as the Parramatta Girls Home. It is a place of terrible stories and a place where the Stolen Generations of New South Wales were kept, and it is still there. Beside it is the Gipps courtyard, still intact. When women arrived on those early convict ships, if they were not selected for their looksâessentially as servants, because there were five men for every woman in the settlement at the timeâthey were sent to the Gipps courtyard, where they lived and broke rocks. That courtyard is intact. Overlooking one side of it is the second-class convict factory, and overlooking the wall on the other side is the orphanage where the children looked down to identify their mothers once they were removed from them, at the age of two.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an extraordinary place. It is still intact, surrounded by high sandstone walls, with few entrances. It is currently used as the Cumberland Hospital's workspace, so it is filled with trucks, storage and rubbish points, but it is still intact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under New South Wales state government urban growth plans for 'revitalising the precinct', they will be selling off large plots of land, including the land inside the Gipps Courtyard, for building two large buildings of six storeys in the intact Gipps Courtyard, where the convict women were first taken when they arrived at the settlement, where they lived and broke rocks. They will be breaking the view into the courtyard between the second-class convict factory and the children's orphanage. Just to make things even better they are going to punch six holes through the sandstone walls so that people can get in and out of the residences in the courtyard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to add insult to this, there is a rather rare colony of grey-headed flying foxes living on the Parramatta River, right up against the wall, that currently enjoy a 300-metre exclusion zone. They will be somewhere between 10 and 15 metres from the balconies of high-rise units. I cannot see that the bats will survive the construction. If they did, they certainly will not survive the complaints of residents who walk out on their balconies to see bats roosting within a few metres of their rather expensive residential units. I cannot see that that is going to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot imagine that this would happen anywhere other than Western Sydney. I cannot believe it would happen in Balmain or in the inner cityâit certainly did not happen to The Rocks. In fact, some of the buildings in The Rocks were renovated with red bricks that were taken from the oldest three-storey building in the colony in Parramatta. The Hyde Park Barracks was actually renovated with sandstone blocks taken from a Greenway building in Parramatta. I cannot believe that the treatment of this site would be as it is anywhere else other than Western Sydney. It is disgraceful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you walk through one of the holes punched in the Gipps Courtyard you will be in another courtyard that houses what used to be the Roman Catholic Orphanage, built in 1841, and Bethal, the first children's hospital, which does look like a chocolate boxâit is so beautiful. It was later used as isolation cells for the Parramatta Girls' Home, so it has some terrible stories and some special meaning to a large number of people, including the stolen generationâthe Indigenous children were put there when they were taken from their families. It is an incredibly important place. That courtyard has also been sold off, and there will be a high-rise residential building within metres of Bethal, dwarfing it and removing the vista of it for visitors. A building between six and 10 storeys high will be as close to it as I am standing to you, Deputy Speaker, here in the chamber today. Those buildings sit right up against the sandstone walls that surrounded the Parramatta Girls' Home. Again, there are extraordinary plans for this incredibly important location.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the landing site for Governor Phillip, on the confluence of the river. If you stand there currently, you are in the middle of nowhere. You cannot see buildings. You can see the confluence of the two creeks forming the river. There are trees on either side of the banks. Under these plans, the river bank on the side will have high-rise buildings right on the bank. It is far too close for the local environment plan and far too close within the exclusion zone overlooking the site where Governor Phillip landed. It should be one of the greatest historical sites in Australia. It is where Governor Phillip started writing his diaries. It will literally be overshadowed by high-rise buildings just a few metres away. Existing roads will be repositioned conveniently to take out the trees, which otherwise would not be able to be removed, because they are heritage listed trees from the colonial days, planted as part of a botanic garden within the site.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the plans, Parramatta War Memorial Swimming Pool, taken out of Parramatta Park, has an eight-storey and 12-storey building on the pool, rezoned, with several six-storey buildings in the car park, with the pool relocated to a commercial venue on what is currently a public oval within the Cumberland Hospital site. There are 6,000 units planned on this siteâ6,000 additional residential units on a siteâwithout considering the heritage aspects at all. The worst thing about this is that while the government plans to sell off all this land so close to these heritage buildings, it has no plans at all about how it is actually going to refurbish or use the heritage buildings themselves. It is a quick land grab, turning the suburb into a dormitory that dwarfs the heritage values without any consideration of what they are actually going to do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms GAMBARO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  I rise to speak on the plight of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. These young men face the death penalty for drug crimes they committed in Indonesia. Whatever way you look at their circumstances, you will see nothing but tragedyâtragedy for them, tragedy for their families, tragedy for the victims of the drug trade both here and in Indonesia, and tragedy for the trauma these circumstances bring to both our nations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not envy the position of Indonesian President Joko Widodo in trying to safeguard his people from the dangers of the national drug emergency his country faces. To get some perspective on the size of the problem, President Widodo has said that some 4.5 million Indonesians need to be rehabilitated due to their illicit or illegal drug use and that 40 to 50 young people die each day due to the same cause. To those who dispute the accuracy of these figures, I say this: the gravity of the real issues at play here are not served by anyone being pedantic about numerical projections.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">President Widodo has a responsibility to the people of Indonesia to them keep the safe. And indeed, we should expect nothing less from him as an honourable and well-intentioned man. It is also clearly a responsibility that he cares about very deeply. To the extent that there is even one death resulting from the illicit and evil drug trade, either in Indonesia or in Australia then it is one death too many. I share his concern and distress at this meaningless loss of life. It is this point that I believe is most important in our consideration of this issueâapplying the death penalty to these two men just adds to the trail of death and human misery caused by drugs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am most heartened to hear that this view appears to also be shared by President Widodo's close friend, the current Governor of Jakarta, Governor Purnama. Governor Purnama was reported on Saturday, during a visit to the Pondok Bambu Prison in east Jakarta, as saying that he was against the death penalty for drug traffickers because they can change and they can be rehabilitated. The specific quote from Governor Purnama as reported in the Indonesian <span style="font-style:italic;">Kompas </span>is: 'I do not agree with the death sentence. They have the opportunity to be a better person.' I could not agree more with this statement. Who among us has not made a mistake? Who among us would not want to make amends for the hurts we have caused others?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is universally acknowledged that Andrew and Myuran have reformed. Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Julie Bishop, has highlighted this fact many, many times. Andrew and Myuran have both acknowledged their crimes and, as part of their commitment to making amends, have reformed not just themselves but also others in prison through a series of rehabilitation programs they have set up inside Kerobokan jail in Bali.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The questions that come to mind most for me when I consider these horrible circumstances not just for Andrew and Myuran but for anyone on death row anywhere in the world are these. What possible good comes from killing these two men? What does killing them actually achieve? What message does it send to anyone who seeks to rehabilitate themselves?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The answers to these questions all highlight the fact that punishment by death is not a path to a better outcome in Indonesia, here or anywhere for that matter. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout history there have been three main justifications for imposing the death penalty: deterrence; the prevention of re-offending; and closure and vindication. There is no statistical evidence that deterrence through death works, in the same way that there is no meaningful evidence of whether the death penalty deters more than life imprisonment; but, in considering the justification of deterrence, I invite everyone to consider the ridiculous contradiction that taking a life will actually save others. In terms of preventing re-offending, it is undeniable that those who are executed cannot commit further crimes; but, when we consider the value of human life, I cannot support a view that this is sufficient justification for taking life. It is often said that where there is life there is hope. And to this end, we should all consider that there are other ways to ensure that offenders do not re-offendâsuch as imprisonment for life, without the possibility of parole. We should also be mindful of the hope for rehabilitation and that if just one life can be redeemed in this way then we have made the right choiceâlife over death.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of justifying killing on the grounds of achieving closure and vindication, it is often argued that the death penalty provides closure for victims' families. But I see this is a weak argument as every family reacts differently. Some people recognise the simple truth that seeking death through vengeance to right a wrong does not provide closure; it only provides more pain. If we are to take a view of the sanctity of life based on humanism, then I ask: how is it that any of us can determine whether it is the value of the life of the victim or the life of the accused that is worth more? Should a desire for retribution determine what is a just punishment? And should not governments defend the sanctity of life equally? My answer to these questions respectively is no and yes, and it is clearly a view that is supported by the Indonesian government when it rightly pleads for the lives of its own citizens on death row for crimes committed in other parts of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In pleading for the lives of Andrew and Myuran, I, like many others, ask for nothing more than what Indonesia asks for its people in the same circumstances. On 12 February this year, His Excellency Ambassador Nadjib Riphat Kesoema appeared before the Human Rights Subcommittee of this parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. It was a sombre and very emotional meeting, and I want to thank His Excellency Ambassador Kesoema for his sensitivity and understanding. He is an honourable man. An issue that came to mind for me following that meeting was that, for all the strengths that our two nations have, surely in seeking to secure the safety of our people from the scourge of drugs there must be a better way to save them from such deaths than to actually extend the cycle of death by killing the accused. To this end, I would like to support the statement of Minster Bishop and say that the delay in the plans to execute Andrew and Myuran has been a relief to the two men and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government will continue to engage with Indonesia to advocate for a permanent stay of execution. It is clear that Andrew and Myuran are reformed men who are making a positive difference to the lives of their fellow prisoners and to Indonesia. The Australian government asks President Widodo to show mercy and forgiveness to Andrew and Myuran. And I add my voice in making this plea to President Widodo as a generous and forgiving man to see the remarkable difference these young men have made in prison. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mercy has just as big a place in the Indonesian concept of justice as it does in Australia. In seeking mercy for these two young men, Australia is only doing what Indonesia does for its citizens on death row overseas. I end with a quote from a great humanist who, as a young officer in the British Army in World War I, saw too many needless deaths in the trenches in the Sommeâwe all know him as John Ronald Reuel Tolkien:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DANBY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  On Friday, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security released its <span style="font-style:italic;">Advisory report on the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014</span>, represented here in this chamber by its thorough and serious deputy chair. This metadata legislation has been a matter of controversy since the previous member for Gellibrand was the Attorney-General, as it was in the previous parliament when I had the honour of participating in the intelligence committee before I became a parliamentary secretary. The committee reviewed this bill after the Minister for Telecommunications introduced its latest iteration in October last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is the third tranche of national security legislation by the current government. I have to say this: after the events in Sydney at the Lindt cafe, was it not wise of this parliament to make sure that all of us acted together to see that there are not further incidents like that and that we support the police and the intelligence services to see that the horrors that have been visited on the Middle East and Europe are not further brought to this country? It is all very well to say that these events did happen at the Lindt cafe, but just think of all of the Australian lives that have been saved by the people who are employed by the Australian people to prevent these kinds of things. They are doing a fine job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Committee has recommended that parliament pass this bill, provided its 37 recommendations are accepted. They include that the legislation has better definitions and descriptions of what data is to be retained, a clarification of what data is not to be retained, a clarification as to which government agencies can be restricted from accessing this data. Frankly, there were some silly groups who had access to this kind of data before, including some local councils. The recommendations also include providing the ombudsman with additional funds to strengthen oversight, giving the Intelligence and Security Committee oversight of the operational use of this legislation, and, importantly, a sunset clause. There are more recommendations that ASIC and the ACCC are authorised to access telecommunications data to assist the investigation and prosecution of white collar crime, that telecommunications data be required to provide customers access to their own metadata that is being stored, that customers be notified if the security of their data is breachedâa provision I will come back to in a minuteâthat stored data be encrypted, and that metadata may not be accessed in civil proceedings. Labor has maintained a sensible, bipartisan approach to national security, and I pay tribute in particular to the members for Isaacs and Holt who have led us in this debate. They have led us because they know about these issues. I wish all members of this parliament would engage with these issues that affect the safety of the Australian people with the same seriousness as them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Diversity of modern communication technology has vastly complicated the work of monitoring what the bad guys are up to. Its complexity has enabled them to become radicalised without necessarily even going to places in the Middle East for training or in some of the other ways of involving people that have happened in other countries. Self-generated people can be in touch with their enablers around the corner or on the other side of the world. Again, as an example of the non-partisan support for this, the opposition commends the foreign minister for withholding what I think are now 100 passports of people who would go over there and participate in some of these vile acts of barbarism against minorities, against cultural objects and against people who live in that region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the importance of Labor's bipartisan approach, the intelligence and security committee advisory report shows that there has been a balance achieved between the security of Australians and the privacy and individual rights that characterise an open democracy like Australia. This is where I would like to turn to the contrast with people like Edward Snowden.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Honourable members will recall that he is a former US intelligence official who stole and leaked thousands of documents in the name of an open society and democracy. He lives now in a secret location in Russia, where, just yesterday, the opposition leader was gunned down in the streets near the Kremlin. I note that Labor's decision to support or not to support metadata legislation will not be determined until Mr Turnbull provides the amended legislation. But should Labor support this legislation, I am sure the Greens and the Snowden fan club will crawl out of the woodwork to denounce us and the legislation. They will not cause any fear in me or in the members for Holt and Isaacs or, indeed, the Leader of the Opposition. They will say this legislation breaches privacy of Australian citizens despite the data breach proposals of Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I drove the member for Isaacs and the member for Holt crazy with this idea that was introduced in other countries where individuals can, having proof that people breach their data, take individual action. This is a serious way of addressing issues of privacy. If you claim that that is your main concern, you would be supporting this legislation. The Snowden adulators have him as a person who bravely leaks for the rights of the individual but they do not support data breach legislation. And they say nothing about any practical measures that could be used to preserve the privacy of the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Science Monitor</span>'s Middle East editor, Mr Murphy, drew my attention to the fact that Snowden and his various champions support the release of material about how the Five Eyesâthe Western intelligence servicesâintercepted telecommunications in northern Iraq prior to Daesh conquering that area. Snowden's release of this data was completely inimical to the safety of Western societies and civilians and, of course, it was to the great detriment of the people who live in that area. I question the motivation of someone who would leak this information on the interception capabilities of telecommunications of al-Qaeda in the Mosul and western and northern Iraq regions. This bastardryâand I use that word advisedlyâhas nothing to do with privacy. This simply undermines the ability of the West to assist Iraq in northern Iraq to prevent al-Qaeda or IS's spread.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not coincidental that some months after Snowden's revelations of how the West intercepts what they are doing, that al-Qaeda and IS encrypted all of their telephone traffic in a way that made what they were doing invisible. And that is the big answer to the mystery of what happened in northern Iraq. How did IS roll into northern Iraq and Mosul without Western secret services being able to pick this up? What on earth does disclosing Western interception methodology have to do with the privacy concerns of Western publics in Melbourne, Manhattan or Manchester? Snowden's leaks contributed to Daesh's victory in northern and western Iraq, the enslavement of the Yazidis, the mass rape of women, the destruction of the Tomb of Jonah and all of the antiquities in the museum in Mosul, as well as the horrible persecution of Christians and people who live in that area. What a dubious achievement! Well done, Mr Snowdon, and his apologists!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to contrast that with the measured and balanced way that the members for Holt and Isaacs have approached this. They have cited Professor George Williams of the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law, having accepted the need for metadata retention. They have quoted Professor Gillian Triggs, of the Human Rights Commission, who acknowledges there is a need for data retention. The member for Holt said in his speech this morning:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We cannot have a discussion about national security laws without acknowledging the growing threat that our country faces from the terrorist menace. What needs to be contemplated by those that have some resistance to this metadata regime is that they can be reassured that the committee looked very extensively at the case for and against. You can rest assured that some of the safeguards that have been put into this reportâthat hopefully will be enshrined in legislationâare amongst the strongest safeguards in the Western world for any data retention regime. You can be reassured that we will continue to monitor the implementation of this data retention regime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Snowden and those who support him have little or no appreciation of the threat that Australian and Western civilians face. They have nothing compared to the carefully balanced efforts that Labor, together with the government, have made to protect the citizens of this country. The Greens are all about protest and rarely constructive. Labor, by contrast, will insist on legislation with sunset causes, parliamentary oversight, data breach provisions andâshould Mr Turnbull provide sensible legislation that will adequately protect Australian's interests and privacyâLabor, I am sure, will pass it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  The origins of the grievance debate date back to the 13th century formation of the House of Commons, when landowners would send their representatives to Westminster to air their grievances. In the modern Australian context, the grievance debate no longer as a procedural significance, but on this occasion I wish to return to our heritage and raise a real point of grievance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue, on which I have received a torrent of constituent correspondence over weeks, that represents a key element in our liberal democracy. In my life some of the best people I have encounteredâand the very worstâhave come from a few professions: politics, journalism and the law. The relationship between the third and fourth estatesâthe government and the pressâis symbiotic and often stretched.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Journalism runs deep in my family. It is a noble profession that dates back to the early 17th century. At its best, journalism is the faithful reporting of the news without bias or prejudice, fear or favour. At its worst, journalism is the use of the medium to circulate argument that has little basis in fact. Journalism has been challenged to adapt, particularly in response to the 24-hour news cycle and the ease of communication through the internet and social media. News is now big business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the integrity of journalism is to be maintained, there will no doubt be times when the business of news will flourish and other times there will, alas, be a slow news day. The unfortunate reality is that slow news days have led to a relatively recent phenomenon where journalism flies closer to an area of entertainment than political reporting. Entertainment is the world of Hollywoodâof great musicians and pop entertainersâwhere the opportunity to dream and the escape to fantasy are not impeded by the facts, by reality or by the very serious business of governing the country. Entertainment now occupies more of our attention in the world of sport, where what happens in the athletes' private lives is of greater importance than the marvels they perform on the field. Every nuance of the athlete's existence is dramatised to make news, to sell papers and to drive ratings. The news is now fully entrenched in this conflict between journalistic integrity and the business of selling papers or chasing ratings to produce higher profits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some journalists see themselves as celebrities with notches on their six-shooter of political lives destroyed or governments brought down. In my early days as an aspiring politician it was arranged for one of these celebrity journalists to provide an insight as to how the press works. He gave an example of using information he knew to be false to damage a politician. This was a corruption of the professionâa sell-out for personal or professional benefit. But why let the truth get in the way of a good story? And so the piece was published and the damage done, resulting in a resignation and a career destroyed; but the journalist had his story and could etch another notch in his gun.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning, in a wholly unrelated debate, I spoke of government funding increases for the treatment of mental illness. A technique often employed in counselling treatment is known as reflection, where the psychologist listens intently to the patient and then strategically selects specific things the patient has said for the patient to then consider objectively. If the recent performance of the press in generating drama around leadership speculation was the subject of their reflection, and if they were to apply to themselves the same imperious standards they feel are their right to apply to our political leaders, how would they judge themselves?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This point is the one that has garnered the most interest from my constituents. The media now appear to play as prominent a role in our democracy as the elected officials, so surely they should be subjected to the same fact checking and the same scrutiny. Almost daily, we see the media mock elected representatives who may make a small error or misspeak in a long speech or interview. I know we must be thick-skinned in this occupation, but I say to the fourth estate: if all you ever do is criticise ideas, what will there be left to print? It is actually a threat to our nation's development that conversation on policy is not interesting enough to print anymore. Is that really the kind of nation we wish to live in? Who will look after our growth over future generations?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The obligation of a member of parliament is to represent their constituents and to act in the national interest. I am here because of the leadership of our partyâwho led us from despair to the brink of victory in 2010 and then, in the next election, with great certainty to government. If not for our leader's untiring fight and absolute commitment, we would not have had our first Indigenous member of this House or the youngest ever member of Parliament. One indisputable quality of our Prime Minister is that he will fight for the right of every Australian to a fair goâas he often says, 'to be your best self'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These two facts, given any amount of reflection, would demand that in return a fair go has been earned. The most central foundation stone of our character as Australians is the entitlement to a fair go. Has our Prime Minister been given a fair go? He declared Australia under new management and open for business, with his aim of providing certainty and stability to make us, again, a reliable trading partner and a nation of sovereign trust.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His character forbids the making of excuses. He is too noble for that. Last week this Abbott government had a good week. We left Canberra feeling positive. The Prime Minister's new processes of consultation are already bearing fruit. There was a universal view that after some unfortunate instability a few weeks earlier we were back on course. Even the polls were starting to turn. And yet, within a few hours of leaving this place, news headlines flashed that the leadership spill is back on, and could even occur within a few days. 'High drama,' unnamed sources were quoted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This kind of activity is not anywhere close to the noble art of journalism. It is a self-serving effort to sell papers, to drive ratings by creating drama. The single story then validated a host of others, which can repeat the creative activity by using the words, 'As previously reported'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we have arrived at a point whereby the so-called reporter can broadcast pure fiction as a way of trying to influence the direction of decision making, we are in trouble. From my own experience, I know there are some members of the media who continue to act with integrity. But to those who sully their reputation by association, to those who act outside the boundaries of a decent civil society, I wish to turn the tables and be a mouthpiece of the community back to you. Given that chance, I would tell you that when the average reader sees a story based on information from unnamed sources, they know that is code for a story that is pure fiction, invented by a desperate journalist. If someone is not willing to attach their name to the comments, then what they have to say is not worth printing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If a meeting is closed, then do not ask those who attend to provide you a rundown of what was said. If a document is private and confidential, then do not print it. It is stolen property. These may seem like pretty basic principles that anybody could understand. Yet our national political conversation has become too dominated by terms like 'backgrounding', 'leak' and 'off the record'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This places shame on all of us in this fine institution. We were elected to represent our constituents, to do what is best for them and the nation, not to get wrapped up in a game of feeding the hungry beast for more ratings, for more sales and for more entertainment to make celebrities out of journalists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some may say that I am naive to hope for a better way. Some in the press will likely criticise me for voicing this call. But, as a local representative, I can absolutely assure them that this is the wish of their audience. The noble art is losing its nobility, and as a nation we are all poorer for it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(a) International education is a major priority for the Government and has been the subject of a number of reviews in recent years. A discussion paper 'Reform of the ESOS framework' was released on 1 October 2014 to seek views from interested stakeholders on opportunities to improve the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 and associated legislative arrangements. Data from the Graduate Careers Australia's Graduate Destinations Survey shows that from 2008 to 2013 Australian domestic graduates consistently gain employment after graduation at higher rates than international students who graduate and choose to stay on in Australia. Deakin University's research has provided advice on strategies that may enhance employment opportunities for overseas students and graduates in Australia.</span>

                  </a>  asked the Minister for Education and Training, in writing, on 14 November 2014 :</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) Will the Minister review the 2012-13 Australian Government Review of labour market demand, which found that there was no shortage of graduate accountants and that graduate employment outcomes for accounting bachelor degrees have fallen over the past five years.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) Is the Minister aware that in 2012, 7,200 domestic students completed a bachelor or higher degree in accounting, with the Department of Employment declaring that 'a more than adequate supply of accountants existed in Australia'.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) Is the Minister aware (a) of reports that overall employment of accountants increased by just 1.3 per cent over the five years to May 2014, which was well below the 'all occupations' average of 7.4 per cent, and (b) that advertised vacancies for accountancy positions have also fallen since 2008.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) Is the Minister aware of the recent media report by Edmund Tadros 'Accounting bodies do about-face on jobs for foreign students' ( Australian Financial Review , 29 October 2014), claiming that the Australian Government says it will review the Skilled Occupations List early next year, and that based on the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency's recommendation, a reduced ceiling of approximately 5,000 places or 3 per cent of the domestic workforce, has been set for accountants in 2014-15. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) Is it a fact that the Department of Employment has recommended that accountants be removed from the Skilled Occupations List, having concluded there is a surplus of accountants and 'deteriorating outcomes for graduates relatively low pay rates for bachelor graduates and weak employment outcomes for masters graduates'; if so, and in light of the evidence from the academic research, media reporting and professional views, will the Minister consider removing accountants from the Skilled Occupations List.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(7) Will the Minister acknowledge the suggestions in the Deakin University's Centre for Research in Educational Futures and Innovation's report Australian international graduates and the transition to employment (September 2014) and media report in part 6), that overseas accounting students are being lured to study accounting in Australia on the misleading impression that it is easy to find work experience, work opportunities and permanent residency in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(8) Is the Minister aware of the findings in Deakin University's report in part 7), which showed that international accounting students were a major source of income for Australian Universities, making up a record 79 per cent of the 17,600 enrolled postgraduate students in 2013, and 55 per cent of the more than 24,500 enrolled undergraduate students. </span>

The current government also supports this arrangement, which allows international students who have recently completed an Australian Bachelors, Masters or PhD qualification to remain in Australia after graduation to gain further work experience in any field they choose. Bachelor and Masters by coursework graduates are eligible for a visa that allows them 2 years of post-study work in Australia, while Masters by research graduates can work for 3 years and PhD graduates for 4 years.

                <span class="HPS-Small">(a) The Australia Government is continuing to consider a potential east coast High Speed Rail (HSR) network by engaging with the Queensland, New South Wales, Victorian and ACT governments about each jurisdiction's level of interest in a potential HSR network, and their capacity and ability to support the proposed development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In line with the recommendations of the 2013 HSR Study Phase 2 Report, jurisdictional consultations have focused on corridor issues relating to the preferred alignment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is currently working with the jurisdictions to identify priority sections of the preferred alignment for potential protection. This work involves considering the wide variety of geography and current land uses through which the corridor is located, including agricultural, urban, residential, commercial and recreational land areas. The priority sections of the corridor for potential protection are most likely to be located in densely-populated urban environments, which have a higher risk of encroachment by competing development. However, the current and likely future use of some areas may mean the expense of acquiring land may be able to be deferred, as may impacts on current owners or users. The issue requires examination at a detailed level.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(b) The Government and the jurisdictions have not yet protected or acquired any sections of the proposed HSR corridor. A decision on whether or not to acquire land will be informed by the outcomes of the Government's continued consultations with the jurisdictions, and will require jurisdictional agreement and contribution. </span>
