                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  I have a couple of statements to update the House on two matters. The first relates to access between committee rooms and the chamber. As part of the Parliament House upgrade works, construction activity at the security guard station located at level 1 Members Hall on the House of Representatives side has commenced and will continue for a couple of months. These works will impede access between committee rooms 1R1, 1R2, 1R3, 1R4 and 1R5 and the Members Hall. If members are in a level 1 committee room and need to attend the chamber for a division, you should first move to the ground floor via either the elevators or the staircase prior to heading to the chamber. Thank you for your ongoing cooperation with these works.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second statement I have relates to the publication of the seventh edition of the <span style="font-style:italic;">House of Representatives Practice</span>. I'd like to inform the House about this. The seventh edition of the flagship publication <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span> has been published by the Department of the House of Representatives, and, as members know well, we rely heavily on it for authoritative advice to inform our roles as chairs and as members. The content of the <span style="font-style:italic;">House of Representatives Practice</span> is particularly important, and, quite apart from its value every day as a reliable and practical resource for our thinking and decision-making in the chamber, it has an added value. Since the first edition in 1981 it has been documenting and putting into perspective the changing and sometimes turbulent times in the life of the House in an accurate and understated way. It provides a very significant foundation to our understanding of the House as an institution. This new edition brings us up to date, with additional precedents from the sixth edition in 2012, a new chapter on the Federation Chamber, an additional chapter on the work of the committees, and discussions on the roles of members, the House, the government and the opposition. All members will be invited to a formal launch of the new edition next week. I thank the Clerk and Peter Fowler in the Chamber Research Office particularly for their contributions to what is the House's most significant publication. I also thank the large number of other staff of the House who've had a significant input to the new edition. The Clerk has provided copies to the offices of all members. I have no doubt I'll soon see lots of post-it notes and annotations on members' new copies as it's invoked during question time, and I commend the seventh edition to all members.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, 86% of energy in Australia comes from the burning of fossil fuels, whilst only 0.1% comes from solar power. Considering Australia has the highest level of solar radiation per square metre than anywhere else in the world, it is absurd that we arenât adopting solar power more heavily into our society. Itâs free- it comes from the sun, unlike coal which we must spend millions of dollars on mining. Although solar power is expensive directly, it is cheaper than fossil fuels in the long-term. Within a few years, people wonât be losing anywhere near as much money as they wouldâve with coal. The burning of fossil fuels is the number one contributor to climate change, and if we continue to burn at the rate weâre going, by 2100, 74% of the Earthâs population will face lethal heat exposure for more than three weeks every year. Sea levels are predicted to rise by more than a metre, and storms, wildfires and droughts will be much more severe and longer-lasting. Solar power, however, can prevent this. That's why we need to embrace solar power and use it instead of fossil fuels.</span>

This would be a great start to Australia's solar intake and I ask the House to act upon a suggestion such as this that will escalate Australia's solar energy usage and lead the Earth towards a better future.</span>

Many voters have filled in reports of Commonwealth crimes and asked the Australian Federal Police to examine Commonwealth crimes committed by these former MPs in signing a false declaration to nominate for election. The Australian Federal Police advised those who lodged the crime reports that reports of Commonwealth Crimes will be ignored in relation to false declaration on nomination forms. The AFP have advised it is up to the Australian Electoral Commission to prosecute those crimes. The AEC have advised their legislation does not allow them to prosecute. The Attorney General department advised in November 2018 that they cannot tell the AFP what should be prosecuted.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Many Australians are suffering from a debilitating condition called Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS). This condition is often misdiagnosed as Fibromyalgia, Parkinson, Multiple Sclerosis to name a few. CIRS is a form of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). With no formal recognition of the condition this has placed many Australians in a situation of not being treated with human dignity by the Medical Profession. Many are happy to treat but not formally diagnosis the condition. At the moment, many Australians have to fly interstate and pay upwards of $900 for a consult. With a long wait list with very few Doctors who are aware of the condition. A more formal recognition and awareness of the condition would bring a dignified diagnosis and treatment plan for all Australians who are suffering. This would result in more Australians being treated and becoming productive members of the community again. The formal recognition of the condition would also include the request to make changes to the Human Rights Act to include discrimination for those suffering from mold exposure. This illness in many cases are resulting from inadequate Work, Health and Safety Practices. I myself was affected in a Government building. If I had become aware of the environmental exposure I would not have suffered a disability resulting by exposure and facing long recovery. This situation was avoidable if full disclosure was made by the workplace.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House's to the importance of citizen's data privacy and security on the Internet. We believe is important that Australia now review and improve the digital rights of its citizens. Regulation of commercial data collection and increased accessibility to data privacy options has the power to improve civilian, commercial and national security, as well as significantly reducing both the economical and psychological impacts of regular and inevitable data breaches, data leaks and internal data abuse. These issues affect all of society, including young children and teenagers. Many nations, including the EU and UK, realise the far-reaching implications of citizen's data privacy and security and have responded. It is vital that Australia responds in a similar manner.</span>

These regulations focus on providing digital rights to citizens, including but not limited to: The right to be informed The right of access The right to rectification The right to erasure The right to restrict processing The right to data portability The right to object Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling. There is also focus on the importance of citizens being secure by default. Furthermore, we believe it is critical that these regulations are developed by an independent panel of privacy and security experts in order to ensure these goals are properly met.</span>

Even worse, the mortality rate of live animals that are exported is currently 3.76%, on ships full of tens of thousands this means of animals hundreds of animals can die in transit. According to the Australian Position Statement on the Export of Livestock released in April 2011, on average, cattle are permitted under a metre of space on the transportation vessel per cow, and this space is even smaller for sheep. Majority of animals that are exported are slaughtered upon their arrival at their destination, yet we still insist on putting these animals through torture before that happens.</span>

Oleg Sentsov was arrested on trumped-up terrorism charges by Russian authorities in the spring 2014 in Crimea. The entire case against him was based on the testimony of two supposed witnesses, one of whom subsequently recanted his initial statement as made under tortures. Sentsov also stated that he was tortured during the investigation of his deal. Sentsov is considered to be a political prisoner by the Human Right Centre Memorial, Amnesty International, PEN International, and other organization. On May 14, Sentsov started an infinite hunger strike demanding to free all Ukrainian political prisoners in Russia. This put his health and the same life in serious danger. Statements in support of Oleg Sentsov during his hunger strike were made by the Spokesperson of the European External Action Service, International PEN organizations of writers, European intellectuals and politics, and more. The issue was raised during the French President Emmanuel Macron visit to St Petersburg on May 26. Still, Oleg Sentsov continues a hunger strike, and no information about his health condition is available.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The current PAYG and company tax system in Australia is complicated and expensive to comply with, and god help anyone who is without resources who gets it wrong! It is seemingly full of "loop-holes". Everyone complains about the system and its fairness. It has a lot of drawbacks and, apparently, little support. This legislation should be repealed and replaced with a flat tax, minus all of the options for individuals and business to minimise their taxable income. So, no laws to reduce tax by moving money offshore or through negative gearing. A tax-free threshold could still be implemented under a flat tax system for individuals and businesses with insufficient resources. My request focusses on providing government with the taxes it needs to do its job, while avoiding the polarisation associated with tax related politics. It would also act as an additional incentive for government to implement policies that are positive for the economy and avoiding economically harmful policies.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I request the House repeal all PAYG and company tax legislation and replace it with a new flat tax of 15-20%. A "tax-free threshold" kept in line with the average annual wage could be used for individuals. The business tax-free threshold would apply to small business. The new legislation should not provide a mechanism to reduce taxable income. This flat tax would simplify the tax system and remove the politics, while ensuring the government is resourced adequately and is incentivised to implement good economic policies.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Single parent families are a growing family type in Australia: as such, ensuring a fair system is in place which ensures the best interests of children must be of paramount concern. The current Child Support Act is encouraging some parents to withhold children from their other parent (parental alienation) and does not reflect societies belief that all children deserve a meaningful relationship with both parents. The current act seeks to ensure that the main care-giving parent receives extra support if the other parent is choosing not to see their child however it is not applied in reverse to ensure that the main care-giver does not withhold the child and receive extra support. Currently, a below regular care determination can be made despite a parent wanting to see their child and being denied that right without cause. There is no onus placed on the main care-giver to negotiate a parenting plan. Currently if this situation exists timely and costly court proceedings are the only option for the alienated parent. For some parents who have teenage children, court action is unlikely to be viable due to the time delays in the courts. This results in a parent not only not being able to see their child but also being effected financially also. This is crippling to that parent.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Requesting that the House amend Social Services Legislation Amendment (Encouraging Self-sufficiency for Newly Arrived Migrants) Bill 2018. The proposed extension to Newly arrived resident's waiting period (NAWRP) is unfair. The current change suggests that all people who gain permanent residency after July 2018 will have to wait 4 years before they can access most benefits. These include individuals who have applied for their permanent residency last year and are waiting for their grant and if they were to receive their grant after Jul 2018 for no fault of theirs (longer processing times) they wouldn't be receiving these vital benefits. Through the current bill the applicants of permanent residency are put to the mercy of case officers which should not be the case. Furthermore there are other people who have been in Australia for more than 5-8 years and will be eligible for permanent residency in near future but they too will be deprived of these benefits even though they have spent a major part of their life in Australia contributing towards the welfare of the nation.</span>

Ensure the governing body is independent and external of government, so they have the power to investigate individual case complaints made by employees, carers, families and vulnerable children to enforce accountability at the frontline. Innocent Braxton Slager died needlessly from neglect after 3 weeks in care in 2014. His case manager had just 3 days internal training to manage his case and those of other children while employed as an administration officer. Details of Braxton's Story: https://www.facebook.com/braxtonnicholasslager/ Many children have died, disappeared, and are being neglected and abused daily nationwide. The main cause of failure in child protection is and always has been the lack of external accountability. The only way to save our vulnerable children is to enforce external accountability through Mandatory Registration as other Western Nations have for their child protection workers and as all other professions in Australia have to protect the public from harm. Child protection workers have more power than any other profession but are not registered or held externally accountable. No one is protected from the harm, often lifelong they cause particularly to children daily. Braxton's Law is recommendations 27 from the Federal Senate Community Affairs Committee 2014 Inquiry into Children in OOHC and has still not been acted on. It should not be the public calling for Mandatory Registration of all child protection workers this is role job of responsible government.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As a person who lives in rentals, large pets are hard to rent with. You have slim options of housing because not all houses can accommodate pets. A landlord can outright refuse to let an uncontained animal on their property, so we are left with slim options. Some people need a companion that can help with stress and loneliness. Pets have many benefits for those suffering mental illnesses such as depression. We do have rabbits and guinea pigs, but they are still too big, and are more of an outside pet compared to something like a hedgehog, which is considered an indoor pet. These pets should be licensed but not outright illegal, as a license would mean that they are living with someone who could take responsibility for their companion and know enough about them to treat them well. When they are properly monitored, registered, and distributed, there would only a negligible risk of Zoonotic diseases or release of animals into the wild. Myself, and many Australians living in small rentals and apartments would be much happier to have the option to have a small, lovely companion to live with. To have the option to own a pet that doesn't make a mess of your home compared to having nothing at all would be great for both landlords and those renting</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Wicks</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 16 October 2017 to the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon Dan Tehan MP, concerning petition number EN0325. The petition requests new laws to prescribe periods within which a delegate is required to make a decision in relation to DVA claims. I apologise for the delay in providing a response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission (MRCC) has previously considered the introduction of statutory timeframes in relation to determining initial liability claims. In June 2014, the MRCC released a report into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of Statutory Timeframes under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (MRCA). </span>A number of potential models were examined as part of this review.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The MRCC recommended that statutory timeframes not be applied to MRCA initial liability claims. It concluded that statutory timeframes would not produce better outcomes for claimants. In particular, the MRCC concluded there is a significant risk that statutory timeframes would result in poor, incomplete and incorrect outcomes for claimants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The time in which an initial liability claim is finalised can be influenced by a number of factors including:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Whether the claim is complete;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The complexity of the claim;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Whether further evidence or information is required from the claimant, the Australian Defence Force, medical practitioners and specialists or other relevant third parties;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Determining the applicable legislation, as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Entitlements Act 1986 </span>(VEA), <span style="font-style:italic;">Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Defence</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-related Claims) Act 1988 </span>(DRCA) and MRCA may all be applicable to the claim; and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The time between incident and lodgement of claim: if there has been a long period between the incident and claim further evidence or information may be required. All of the above factors may result in unavoidable delays in determining the initial liability claim.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While I acknowledge that statutory timeframes for determining initial liability claims may provide certainty to claimants, there is a significant risk that claims may be determined without consideration of the full merits of the case and result in inequitable outcomes among clients with similar circumstances. Determinations should be based on evidence, as per the legislative intent of the repatriation legislation, as opposed to timeframes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current process for determining claims is that, where possible, the investigation of all claims commences within seven days of a delegate being assigned the case, all follow up actions are completed on the day they become due and that delegates seek assistance immediately where difficulties or complexities in determining the claim arise.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The MRCC and the Repatriation Commission are committed to determining all claims for compensation in an accurate and timely manner. As part of this, the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) is undertaking a number of reform initiatives to improve the compensation claims process as well as communication and engagement with clients. These initiatives include:</span>
            </p>

Over the past four financial years, the mean time taken to process has decreased for DRCA and MRCA liability claims, and remained steady for VEA claims. A graph showing this data is enclosed. The Commission are continuing to undertake work to improve the time taken to process compensation claims, and reduce the time taken to process claims.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 February 2018 referring petition EN0440 submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions which seeks to ban pesticides in Australia. As the minister with portfolio responsibility for agricultural chemicals, I welcome the opportunity to respond to the petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As reflected in our robust regulatory systems, protecting human and environmental health is always the Australian Government's first priority and a ban of pesticides is not warranted. I recognise the considerable risks posed by the misuse of agricultural chemicals to the environment and human health. At the same time, where chemicals can be used safely, they enhance the productivity and competitiveness of our agricultural sector and protect our community and environment from pests and diseases.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a risk-based, efficient and robust regulatory framework for agricultural chemicals. Before agricultural chemicals can be legally sold, supplied or used in Australia, they must be evaluated and registered by the independent national regulator for agricultural chemicals, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The APVMA and its external advisory agencies scientifically assess the risks posed by new agricultural chemicals to ensure the health and safety of people, animals and the environment are protected, and to support international trade. The APVMA may also undertake a formal review of a registered agricultural chemical or product if new scientific information emerges suggesting a change in the risks to people, animals, the environment, or trade.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The states and territories are responsible for regulating and managing the use of agricultural chemical products once they are sold and ensuring that users comply with the APVMA-approved product instructions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government does not support a Royal Commission into the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA), as there's already been a number of significant, independent reviews conducted and several new reviews underway relating to suicide and mental health in the veteran community and the performance of the Department. Furthermore, DVA has listened to concerns from the veteran community about its programs and delivery of its services and is on a substantial journey of transformation to put veterans and their families first. This transformation will address DVA's business processes, client service, organisational culture and information and communications technology (ICT).</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, in response to the tragic death by suicide of a veteran, Mr Jesse Bird, on 27 June 2017 the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Dan Tehan MP, requested a joint inquiry by DVA and the Department of Defence and the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service into the management of Jesse Bird's case. Nineteen recommendations were made by the inquiry with a focus on improvement of the service and experience of veterans seeking compensation and support. These recommendations were released publicly by the then Minister. Changes have been made to DVA policies, client service, processes and systems to address the recommendations. An independent review will be conducted later this year into the Department's implementation of these recommendations.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2016-17 Budget, the Government provided $23.9 million over two years to enable OVA to upgrade its ICT for rehabilitation and compensation claims processing. In the last two years DVA has been progressively building new ICT capacity for this processing and this capability has already had an impact in reducing processing times and improving the quality of decision-making and communication with clients.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2017-18 Budget, the Government allocated $166.6 million over four years as a first tranche of funding towards DVA's transformation journey â transforming DVA into a more connected, client-focussed organisation responsive to the needs of the veteran community. Veterans and their families will benefit from a better experience dealing with OVA and improved programs of support. The first year has been focussed on delivering more modern technology foundations for DVA's new ICT infrastructure and establishing new DVA service capabilities. Already a number of new service concepts have benefitted the veteran community. DVA's transformation has been informed by considerable program of engagement, communication and co-design with the veteran community. This has enhanced DVA's understanding of its areas of client service delivery needing improvement and the new programs and services required to meet the needs and expectations of the veteran community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2018-19 Budget, the Government has continued to invest in DVA's transformation journey with a further $111.9 million over four years to build on the foundations laid in 2017-18. This represents a substantial financial commitment by Government to transform OVA to provide a more modern and client-centric service to veterans, their families and the broader community.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Wicks</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 26 March 2018 concerning Luxury Car Tax (LCT). I sincerely apologise for the delay in responding to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is not currently considering removing the LCT, which has existed in one form or another for many years, Prior to its introduction in 2000 as part of the goods and services tax (GST) changes, luxury cars were taxed at the standard rate of wholesale sales tax plus a higher rate above the luxury threshold.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of the LCT was to ensure that when the GST was introduced, the price of luxury cars did not fall disproportionately more than the price of standard cars. The LCT originally applied at a rate of 25 per cent of the value of the luxury cars above the LCT threshold. The rate was increased to 33 per cent (the current rate) in 2008.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In acknowledgement that fuel-efficient cars have a lower environmental impact, legislation was passed in 2008 to distinguish the LCT treatment of fuel-efficient cars from other cars. For this reason, the LCT threshold is $65,094 for ordinary cars, and $75,526 for fuel-efficient cars. This distinction in the application of the LCT is designed to encourage the purchase of fuel-efficient cars.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government uses the revenue from the LCT to fund essential services that all Australians benefit from such as health, education, defence and security.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 26 March 2018 concerning removing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on feminine hygiene products. The Government understands the application of the GST to feminine hygiene products is an important issue for many people. I sincerely apology for the delay in responding to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The GST is a broad-based tax of 10 per cent on most goods, services and other items sold or consumed in Australia. Limited exemptions were included where imposing the CST would be technically difficult, create inequities between private and public sector providers, or necessary to secure the passage of the GST legislation through the Senate.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations </span>and Commonwealth legislation, a change to the GST rate or base would need the unanimous support of the States and Territories. At the August 2015 Council on Federal Financial Relations Tax Reform Workshop, former Treasurer Joe Hockey raised the issue of feminine hygiene products with the States and Territories. As no unanimous agreement was reached, no changes to the existing GST arrangements were progressed.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As you and the Committee would be aware, the United Kingdom House of Commons has arrangements to enable debate on petitions in certain circumstances. The request in the petition would, in my view, require standing orders to be amended. As you would be aware, formal proposals to amend the standing orders of the House are a matter for the House to consider, usually at the initiative of the Leader of the House. On this basis, I suggest it would be appropriate for you to direct this petition to the Leader of the House, the Hon Christopher Pyne MP. The Leader of the House may then choose to consult the Clerk if he wishes to propose an amendment to the standing orders.</span>

The first Coat of Arms showed the kangaroo and emu supporting the shield and standing on a grassy mound. The shield displayed the cross of St George. King George V made Australia's second grant of arms in a Royal Warrant dated 19 September 1912. The significant change was to include the symbols of the states on the shield. The petitioner may be interested to know that the shield includes two images of the Imperial Crown, as seen in the symbols for Victoria and Queensland.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government continues to use the nomenclature 'former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia' in all bilateral and multilateral interactions with the country. Australia's policy strives to be impartial by using the terminology agreed to in the United Nations by the parties to the dispute. This is a temporary measure pending a mutually agreed solution by the governments in Athens and Skopje.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  Of the 17 petitions I present to the House today, sixteen are e-petitions. In total 309 e-petitions have now been presented to the House during the 45th Parliament, either by myself as Chair of the Petitions Committee or by individual members of the House. In contrast, 273 paper petitions have been presented to the House during this parliament.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These numbers continue to show how e-petitioning has successfully engaged Australians in petitioning the House. The committee reflected on the first years of e-petitioning during its recent inquiry into the House e-petitioning system. After hearing directly from users and learning from the experience of other parliaments, the committee recommended a number of enhancements to further simplify the e-petitioning process and improve the user experience. The committee hopes these improvements will see even more Australians create, sign and share e-petitions on matters of concern to them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="E09" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms OWENS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  I'm very proud to stand to support the Fair Work Amendment (Restoring Penalty Rates) Bill, because we on this side of the House understand just how much pressure families are under. Cost-of-living pressures and the cost of rent in my area of Parramatta are dramatically impacting on households' capacity to pay their bills. I know how many families in my area trying to balance their work, family and cost-of-living issues have sorted out ways to get through their lives by working a few extra shifts on the weekend, with maybe one partner working a few extra days. That is incredibly important to the decisions they have made about how they fund their families and pay the bills. And this decision by the Fair Work Commission and the decision by this Turnbull government to enthusiastically support that decision show just how out of touch this government is. It shows a complete lack of understanding of how much pressure households are under from the costs of living and stagnant wage growth, let alone wage cuts. It's also bad economics. It was at the time and it has been proven to be so since it was introduced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the impact on families first. Let's look at who's hit and who suffers the most. Low-paid workers in retail, fast food, hospitality and pharmacy have had their penalty rates cut and, when it flows through finally, will be up to $3,273 worse off a year. That's a $70 cut for a Sunday penalty shift. Calculations show that, because of the cuts to Sunday and public holiday penalty rates, workers in various industries face cuts to take-home pay up to the following amounts: pharmacy, $3,273; retail, $2,450; hospitality, $1,884; fast food, $1,628; and restaurants, $586. The government can afford to give $7,000 tax cuts to people on $200,000 a year, while taking away penalty rates from the people who can least afford it. In Parramatta, there are 12,300 people or one in six workers in the retail, food and accommodation industries affected by the cuts to penalty rates. That's one in six. In Parramatta, we're seeing up to one in six workers losing up to $77 a week as well as an additional $80 a week on new tolls, rents well over $400 a week and a new Medicare levy coming in for lower income workers. The government, of course, thinks it can compensate people with a $10 a week tax cut for what are substantial decreases in their take-home pay. But it's not just about the families that are affected. These are actually customers. One in six customers in Parramatta have had their take-home pay cut, and these are the lowest paid people in our community who spend every dollar they earn. If you cut the wages of one in six of your customers, what do you think you get? You get less spending for a start. That, to me, is so obvious. When we have been debating this for over a year now, I've been wondering why those on the other side who claim to know so much about business don't get what happens when one in six of your customers get their take-home pay cut, particularly if those customers are the ones that spend all the money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The figures prove the point. A survey of 1,351 workers by the University of Wollongong and Macquarie University found 'there has been no short-term increase in the number of hours worked by employees'. The government promised that, if they cut penalty rates, there would be more jobs and more hours. There are not. University of Wollongong lecturer Martin O'Brien is reported as saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ some workers experienced a drop in the number of penalty-rate hours they worked in the first two months after penalty rates were reduced. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They concluded:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ 15 per cent of all retail workers who were employed on Sundays worked 9 per cent fewer hours, while hospitality workers experienced no change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So retail workers actually worked fewer hours. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also obvious that the cuts would impact on consumer spending. All those penalty rate workers that dropped into the pub on the way home from work before their penalty rates were cut just don't do it now. They just don't do it. They have less money in their pockets to spend in local businesses. The controversial cuts to Sunday and public holiday rates on 1 July were followed by the weakest three months of consumer spending since the global financial crisis. So consumer spending was at zero growth following the cuts to penalty rates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All the promises about the positive benefits of cuts to penalty rates have not been forthcoming, but damage to the income of households has. We have families increasingly struggling to pay the bills and looking at subsequent penalty rate cuts over the next few years. It's bad policy from the government, and I support this amendment to wind it back.</span>

For over 100 years now, rates of pay in this country have been set independent of government. The reason for that was in case you ever had a situation where a populist leader, desperate to do anything to become Prime Minister, turned around and promised a pay increase in an attempt to get votes. Heaven help us that that's exactly where we find ourselves today. The even greater irony is that the independent umpire in its current form was in fact put in place and overseen by the Labor Party and the union movement, post the 2007 election: the Fair Work Commission, which is the independent umpire in all things to do with industrial relations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The irony doesn't stop and the hypocrisy doesn't stop there. The Leader of the Opposition was one of the key architects of that act, where the four-yearly reviews of modern awards were initiated, the process that came up with the decision that we're debating today. There was hypocrisy again in 2010, when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister responsible, when there was the first decision by the Fair Work Commission to reduce penalty rates in some modern awards. What did we hear from those opposite? Crickets. We heard nothing. Then in 2014, at the end of another four-yearly review, there were more changes to reduce Sunday penalty rates to some restaurant awards. And what did we hear then? We finally heard support for the Fair Work Commission, especially, most loudly, from the member for Gorton, the shadow minister, who stood up and argued that that is how the system works and the Fair Work Commission is the independent umpire, as it should be, as is fit and proper. But the even bigger hypocrisy here, the latest example, is that those opposite today are saying that they will turn around and overrule their own independent umpire, the Fair Work Commissionâthe one that they constructed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that we're talking about, the Fair Work Amendment (Restoring Penalty Rates) Bill 2018, does not include changes to enterprise bargaining agreements. But the reality is that the Leader of the Opposition, in his union career pre politics, did exactly what he is rallying against today. In 2006, in an agreement that he oversaw, 780 BigW workers in North Queensland had their Sunday penalty rates cut from 200 per cent to 150 per cent. In another 2006 agreement, again under his stewardship, 129 Target workers in North Queensland had their penalty rates cut from 200 per cent to 150 per cent.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It suited him then; it doesn't suit him now. Why? Because he's in a populist drive for votes. At the same time, as I mentioned, there is the hypocrisy. I ran into a young bloke, Michael, in my electorate working in a major fast-food chain a couple of weekends ago, on a Saturday. I asked him what roster he works. He works six hours on a Saturday and six hours on a Sunday. He is $27 a week worse off because he is employed under an enterprise bargaining agreement that was negotiated by the shop, distributive and allied union, the SDAâthe biggest supporter of the Labor Party in terms of both membership and dollars over the last decadeâwhich has actually reduced penalty rates far in excess of what the Fair Work Commission has come up with, after taking hundreds of submissions on the topic across all players in the industry and considering the case on its merits. </span>

You've got predominantly young schoolkids and university students in these major retail chainsâmultinational in some cases, but national in all casesâthat are subject to enterprise bargaining agreements that have deductions that are well in excess of what we are talking about the Fair Work Commission making. It is hypocrisy writ large. Today is just the latest example of that. If the Leader of the Opposition tells you it's raining, I'd advise those in Australia to stick their head outside and have a look.</span>

Before I do, in the absence of the shadow industrial relations minister, I'd like to pass on my condolences to Brendan and Una on the loss of their fabulous Jodi Dack at this sad time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak on this bill, which was introduced by the Leader of the Opposition in June. Sadly, the government's agenda didn't include bringing this bill on for debate before the long winter recess. Clearly, they had other things on their mind, like trying to give an $80 billion tax cut to the big end of town. The take-home pay of working Australians was cut yet again on 1 July, again on this minister's watch, on the Turnbull government's watch. On 1 July, hardworking Australians who make sacrifices to work the hours when most of us are spending time with our families again had their take-home pay slashed. This time the cuts were even deeper. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when workers are suffering the fall-out from wage stagnation and rising cost-of-living pressures, this heartless government has overseen more money leaving workers' pay packets. This mean-spirited government has done everything it can to undermine working Australians. More than 13,000 workers in my electorate of Moreton rely on penalty rates to put food on the table, to put petrol in their cars and to pay their rentâthat's one in six workers. Cutting penalty rates means my people will have to work longer hours for less pay. That is why Labor has introduced this bill to protect a principle as old as the Labor Party itself: a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's nothing fair about the lowest-paid workers having their take-home pay cut. There's nothing fair about women, who already suffer from the gender pay gap, having their take-home pay cut. There's nothing fair about the economic policies that the Turnbull government believes in and continues to inflict on Australian workersâpolicies that will give corporate giants an $80 billion tax cut while cutting $17 billion from our schools and cutting $440 million from preschool education, which will see 350,000 Australian children miss out on preschool altogether. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Medicare freeze has effectively already cut $3 billion from Australia's health care. Not protecting the penalty rates of Australian workers and cutting the take-home pay of the most vulnerable workers deepens inequality. On average, a woman earns $25,000 less each year than the average man and spends between five and 14 hours a week doing unpaid housework compared to fewer than five hours for men. Yet women make up the majority of employees in industries that will have their penalty rates cut, such as retail and hospitality. I would hope Minister Cash spoke up and knew about this when this cut came through on 1 July. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Vulnerable, low-paid workersâwomen and young people especiallyâare the people who will suffer most from these penalty rate cuts. The young university students who work weekends so they can attend their lectures during the week will be forced to make up extra hours to pay their way through university. Single mothers will have to spend more time away from their children just so they can put food on the table. You have to wonder about the priorities of the Turnbull government, which are prepared to cut the take-home pay of young people who are striving to make a greater contribution to Australia and of mothers who just want to give their children a good start in lifeâthis, while they are zealots about making sure their big corporate mates get a tax cut, including giving the banks $17 billion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tragically, cutting the penalty rates of people who earn low wages is also hurting the economy. Workers on low wages usually spend every cent they earn. They now have less to spend, starving the economy of much-needed expenditure; it's especially bad for retail and hospitality. On eight separate occasions in this parliament, this government has voted against protecting the penalty rates of vulnerable, low-paid workers. Eight times it has made it clear that it will not protect the wages of hardworking Australians. Labor will not sit back and do nothing. Labor will protect hardworking Australians, who are just trying to pay their bills. That's why the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, introduced this bill. It's a bill to stop the cuts to penalty rates and ensure that they can never be cut again. The Turnbull government did not bring this bill on for debate before 1 July. Why? Because it wanted Australian workers to get a pay cut. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Penalty rates are not a luxury for the 13,000 workers in my electorate of Moreton. Penalty rates put food on their tables and petrol in their cars and give them a chance in life. The Labor Party will always stand up for such workers. The Labor Party will always do the right thing. The fact is that the opposition leader has always stood up for workers. Despite the comments being made by those opposite, the opposition leader has a long track record of actually working to support working-class and middle-class Australiansâthose who want to get ahead. Labor will always stand up for those workers, and I will fight for penalty rates as long as I am here. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  It's a great pleasure to get up and speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Restoring Penalty Rates) Bill 2018, because it's not often in this place, Mr Speaker, that you see an own goal being provided while it's in action. It's not a hole in one like the member for Shortland's new mini golf course but an own goal, where the opposition get up and move a motion, filled with impassioned speeches concerned about penalty rates so that they can load up onto Facebook and their social media accounts something that simply isn't occurring. Instead, what it does is provide an opportunity for the government to talk honestly about what is actually happening and shine some light onto the dishonest scare campaigns led by the opposition and particularly by the actions of the Leader of the Opposition, who has never shied away from an attemptâand the previous speaker was rightâto cut people's penalty rates, to cut their benefits and, even worse, while he takes money from them as a former union leader, to advance his own interests at their expense. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I actually happen to agree with the previous speaker on the point about penalty rates being necessary, particularly in disproportionately being to the benefit of young people who are seeking work, often when they're balancing out multiple workplaces or they're also studying, or women who may want flexibility in their workplace arrangements. But, of course, many Australians want flexibility in their workplace arrangements. These are exactly the people that the opposition leader has a long track record, and the Labor Party has a long track record, of selling out. We have the example in 2006 with the agreement for 780 Big W workers in North Queensland who had their penalty rates cut from 200 per cent under the award to 150 per cent under the wonderful leadership of the opposition leader and the Australian Workers' Union. We had the other 2006 agreement covering 129 Target workers in North Queensland who had their penalty rates cut from 200 per cent under the award to 150 per cent as well. Another example in a long line, a conga line, of secret deals done between the opposition leader as a trade union leader and big business to advance his interests at the expense of workers is the 2006 agreement covering 119 Just Jeans workers, who also had their penalty rates cut from 200 per cent under the award to 150 per cent. The result for all these workers was that they had $53 less pay in their pockets for a Sunday shift. What a proud record the Australian Labor Party has in defending the interests of workers! </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many examples. The union has a long history of selling out its members and their interests by striking deals with big business to advance the interests of the apparatchiks who operate inside their unions and their political arm, which is, of course, the Australian Labor Party. These same workers have watched their penalty rates disappear under the Australian Workers' Union and are now watching the shallow morals of the Leader of the Opposition spread like a weed throughout the Labor Party. It's a cancerous infection that is now deep at the heart of the opposition, who don't care about workers and won't stand up for them but carry with them the legacy and track record of selling them out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this bill, the Leader of the Opposition is essentially asking the Fair Work Commission to act with the same inconsistency he has demonstrated day in, day out in his role as a leader of the union and also as the opposition leader sitting in this parliament. It might come as a surprise, but being opportunistic and untrustworthy are not character traits that should be emulated. Australians expect their leaders to act with integrity and, I might add, some consistency, which the opposition leader can claim no capacity to do. They also don't expect politicians to demoralise independent bodies like the Fair Work Commission purely for their political gain. The Fair Work Commission, as set up by Laborâlet us remind ourselves of thisâis required to ensure awards are fair and relevant, taking into account the impact on business employment costs and, of course, wanting to increase the number of jobs in the economy. That includes making evidence based adjustments to our award system that may involve corrections to take-home pay. You cannot expect the Fair Work Commission to perform its role if it loses the ability to deal with the different challenges affecting different workplace arrangements. There needs to be some flexibility to grow jobs for those people who are denied them. Both people and beliefs are disposable to the Leader of the Opposition and, as we've come to expect, if his lips are moving, you can't assume it's for anything other than self-opportunism.</span>

This shows the total lack of policy direction from this government and, in effect, it shows just how out of touch the government is with low-paid workers in Australia at the moment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to support the Fair Work Amendment (Restoring Penalty Rates) Bill 2018. It's often said by commentators and indeed in this place that the news cycle, social media and political culture conspire to create a situation where arguments can be run, won and indeed lost in the space of hours, days or weeks on matters that seem to be of prime importance but, for those not engaged in politics, are of little consequence. If politics is the contest of ideas, those ideas should be about the issues that matter to the electorate. One side of politics may seek to promote its vision for Australia. Our responsibility as the opposition is to set up our alternative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast between the government's priorities and those reflected in this bill is significant. In fact, the contrast could not be more marked. This government has, at least in my view, a one-point plan, because that is all it has left. This one-point plan involves giving a tax cut to the largest corporations in Australia, including the big banks, in order to drive prosperity, championing the economics of trickle-down. Labor says that the revenue forgone through a tax cut for the big end of town could or should be spent on matters that deserve priorityâimportant priorities like our healthcare system, education and supporting the jobs of the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to look at the immediate pressures upon Australian families. Australian voters know that this government cannot be trusted when it makes promises like savings on their power bills. Cost pressures are affecting ordinary Australians every day, and they need to see practical reliefânot trickle-down economics, not promises that this government's energy policy will see reductions in power bills and not promises of new employment driven by tax cuts but practical relief which is targeted at those who need it most.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The extraordinary thing is that this government, which claims a mantle of fiscal responsibility, should know that giving a tax cut to the largest corporations means that there is less money in the budget to pay for services that are important for ordinary Australians. They should know, because many economic commentators have been expressing their concern for many years that low wage growth is a significant risk for the Australian economy and threatens growth within the Australian economy, including employment growth, which also has the effect of depressing the amount of tax that will be collected from both personal and corporate income tax. In this setting the government needs to take responsibility for cuts to penalty ratesâcuts that affect the take-home pay of more than 700,000 Australian people and cuts that materially affect low-paid workers, students and people in the regions, including northern Tasmania, in which my electorate of Bass is based.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is quite properly criticised for being out of touch and failing to understand the pressures that have built up over many years due to low wage growth not keeping pace with cost-of-living increases. This government either doesn't care or simply ignores the fact that many low-paid workers will have suffered a reduction in their income, meaning there is less disposable income circulating within many communities. Small business relies upon customers that are able to access either disposable income, savings or borrowing. Any reduction in the disposable income of their customers will in turn affect those small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear no more about the potential for increased employment in hospitality or retail trade as a consequence of the reduction of weekend penalty rates. How many people really believe the promises that reduction in penalty rates would enable the employment of more staff? Even the government's much-vaunted job creation fails to recognise that wages growth overall is depressed, which in turn creates limitations upon economic growth. Underemployment continues to be a significant problem. People who are in insecure or part-time work are sustained by penalty rates. In some instances they organise their lives so that they are able to work on a Sunday so that they can receive extra income to sustain their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The spectre of rising inequality is something that should not be ignored by this government. Whilst the Treasurer insists that inequality is not a problem, economic commentators insist that increased inequality is again a restraint on this economy not just affecting those in insecure work and low-paid work but also limiting the opportunities of businesses to expand and the economy as a whole to grow in a more robust and sustainable manner. Only Labor has a plan to address the immediate concerns of workers that their wages will be cut.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOODENOUGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  I have listened to the contributions of other members and wish to make the point that the commercial landscape, particularly in the areas of retail and hospitality services, has changed dramatically over the past decade. Retail trading hours have extended. Consumers demand more choice and flexibility in the hours during which they shop and access services. Competition has increased both domestically and from emerging economies in our region. In an increasingly global economy, costs have risen and margins have narrowed. Socially, we have changed as a nation as our nation has become more multicultural, with a diversity of customs. So, no longer is Sunday the universal day of rest that it once was, with different cultures observe Friday or Saturday as their preferred days of rest or those with busy lifestyles choosing to schedule their work and leisure commitments around study timetables or family commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The contemporary Australian workplace must also adapt to these trends in order to stay relevant and competitive. In my electorate of Moore, retail businesses and those in the hospitality services sector make up a significant proportion of the local economy, with Hillarys marina being a major tourist destination, as well as a golf resort, major shopping centres, a bulk goods retail precinct and a service industrial area. Many businesses in my electorate are small to medium businesses, which are represented by the Joondalup Business Association. Our local business community is experiencing difficult times in the economic downturn and would like to extend trading hours to take advantage of the trend in consumers choosing to shop and dine at their convenience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a business owner myself, I have experienced a recent decline in retail turnover and have seen a few tenant vacancies as the economy goes through a rough patch. Trading hours in Western Australia have been extended only relatively recently compared with the eastern states. Our dining and hospitality venues tend to close earlier than in the east, leaving locals, tourists and visitors with unmet demand as many small shops, pharmacies and takeaway shops have found it too expensive to open on Sundays and public holidays. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The independent Fair Work Commission has made a determination on penalty rates after extended hearings and consultation. The recommended reforms are both measured and moderate and will mean that our small business sector will be able to compete on a level playing field with big business, which currently uses enterprise agreements to make deals with unions to reduce Saturday and Sunday penalty rates. For instance, the local takeaway shops and cafes at Hillarys marina will typically have to pay their staff $8 per hour more than McDonald's or KFC, which have negotiated enterprise agreements with the unions. Similarly, a family-owned, speciality gourmet greengrocer shop will typically pay $5 an hour more than Woolworths under its union negotiated enterprise agreement. A family bottle shop is more likely to be subjected to a wage bill of $7 per hour more than Dan Murphy's. A family-owned hardware store is likely to pay $5 per hour more than Bunnings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the current economic climate, margins can be less than 10 per cent and penalty rates can be the difference between returning a profit or making a loss. I would much rather see businesses in my electorate opening on Sundays and public holidays, employing people, rather than closing due to excessive costs. Why should small businesses be denied the same conditions as large businesses? The independence and consistency of the Fair Work Commission in making its determination on penalty rates should be respected, as it followed due process and is moderate in nature. It will set a bad precedent to arbitrarily interfere with determinations made by the Fair Work Commission, which are designed to boost the economy and create employment. Wages should be determined by productivity as opposed to the time of work. Inflationary pressures arise when wage growth is not matched by productivity gains. The modern workforce has a great degree of flexibility in choosing when to work. To match the contemporary consumer preferencesâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Batman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:37</span>):  I rise to support the Fair Work Amendment (Restoring Penalty Rates) Bill. I am constantly surprised and amused by the government's sudden respect for independent umpires, with regards to the Fair Work Commission, when we know that they unilaterally abolished the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which was an independent umpire that would have meant that truck drivers would not have to drive themselves to death under unfair conditions. The government simply show ignorance; they do not know the difference between the bargaining regime and what is a unilateral cut to people's pay by the Fair Work Commission. These are two very different things. Being elected to parliament is a great privilegeâone beyond beliefâand I intend to use this time, as I come to it very late, to make a difference. That is what we should be doing here. That is why I joined the Labor Party. It was to be in a party that formed governments and has, as its objective, the great challenge laid down by Ben Chifley: to make people's lives better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House often wonder what the Prime Minister strives to do each day for everyday Australians. Does he ever get out of bed and think, 'Today, I want to make a single mum's life easier. I want to shore up jobs for kids in Townsville. I want to find a way to meet the challenges facing Indigenous families in remote areas. I want to help the homeless and fix the scourge of insecure work'? Does he even worry about people struggling on low incomes? If he does, he doesn't show it. All he shows us is that he is about helping the wealthy stay wealthy and pretending that he believes in trickle-down economics while he watches the IPA froth at the mouth when he talks about tax cuts for incredibly powerful and wealthy corporations. I don't normally harp on about individuals, but todayâas hundreds of thousands of workers on low incomes face losing wagesâI find it incomprehensible that the Prime Minister and his government refuse to admit that cutting penalty rates will adversely affect people on low incomes. They refuse outright to stop it happening. They could stop this happening, right here, by supporting this bill. I am sorry, but this is inexcusable. We have heard over and over the damage this will do to families, to individuals and to the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Penalty rates have existed for decadesâaround 70 years, in factâand the economy has continued to grow and the hospitality and retail sectors continue to employ more and more people. No-one believes jobs will increase dramatically with wage cuts. In fact, the opposite is true. In those depressed economies in the US, raising wages has resulted in stronger, better economic conditions. There are those who will say that when wages are out of control the economy suffers. The only wages out of control are those of CEOs of multinational corporations. Wages growth for ordinary Australians is at an all-time low. In fact, people in this country are working harder and making more profit for companies but their pay is going backwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the Prime Minister, I know the Leader of the Opposition worries every day about those who are struggling to make ends meet. He worries deeply about the effect of cutting already low wages, and that is why he has introduced this bill. He, and those of us on this side of the House, knows that penalty rates make a real difference. The $70 on a Sunday wouldn't be a drop in the ocean for the member for Wentworth, but for so many people it puts food on the table and pays the bills. We on this side of the House want working mums to have time to care and earn a decent part-time, secure wage. Penalty rates are part of that. We want young people away from home combining study and work not to have to couch surf. Penalty rates are part of that. We want low-paid older people to be able to afford to buy their grandkids Christmas presents. Penalty rates are part of that. We want families to afford a simple holiday or pay their energy bills. Penalty rates are part of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We respect the contribution of working people. In fact, we honour it. If you work unsociable hours, we actually think that you should be paid something for thisâfor missing out on those times with your family and friends. This legislation is as real, as practical and as urgent as it gets. I want people to have better lives and, yes, that is everyone from asylum seekers, migrant workers, nurses, hairdressers and cleaners to truck drivers and so on. I want something better for people everywhere. Saving penalty rates is part of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Workers in Australia need a pay rise. Everybody is arguing that, from the Reserve Bank of Australia right through to every economist that has written on this issue. Australians need a pay rise, a decent pay rise, but we have a weak and mean-minded, bank-loving, corporate-kowtowing Prime Minister who still wants to cut the lowest-paid people's pay packets. This is a disgrace.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  Here we are, the first day back after the winter recess, we're not even an hour into the new parliamentary sessions and yet we have this blinding hypocrisy from the Labor Party. The member for Batman gave the game away when she brought up bringing back the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal in this debate. The tribunal was simply about putting sanctions and mandates upon small business operators in the road transport sector but not putting the same sanctions or mandates against the large companies with their unionised employees. This is exactly what we are seeing in this argument over penalty rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be nice if the Labor Party came in and said that the bill that they were introducing applied to all the cuts that have been made by their friends at the SDA over recent years, but, no, it's not. This is the whole problem, it was those cuts to penalty rates that were made and authorised by the union officials that forced the hand of the commission. Let's just have a look at some of them. At Bunnings the 'shoppies' union, the SDA, and the Leader of the Opposition's former union, the AWU, cut penalty rates for workers at Bunnings from zero on Saturday and down from 100 per cent to 50 per cent on Sunday. Where were all the members of the Labor Party standing up and saying how terrible these cuts to penalty rates were then? We didn't hear a whisper or a murmur from them. All that did was make small business in the hardware sector have to pay more wages than their competitorsâtheir large, big-end-of-town competitors, backed by their union matesâso they were at a competitive disadvantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the same thing at David Jones. The SDA, with the backing of the Labor Party and all the Labor members that sit over there, cut penalty rates at David Jones. They cut them to zero on a Saturday and down to 50 per cent on a Sunday. That put David Jones, with a unionised workforce, at a competitive advantage against small business that were forced to pay higher wages on a weekend. Where were the complaints from the Labor Party when that happened? Absolutely none.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example: the SDA cut the penalty rates for workers at Pizza Hut in Queensland, making them over $13,700 worse offâthey actually cut the penalty rates to zero on a Saturday and Sunday! And where was the outrage of the Labor members of parliament over this? When did they come into this place and complain about penalty rates being cut for Pizza Hut workers in Queensland? A deathly silence. But that cut, again, placed a large corporation with a unionised workforce at a competitive advantage over their small-business competitors. And that is what we see this debate is all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This debate has nothing to do with penalty rates. It is about more union control, more union dominance, across the workforce. The Labor Party don't care about those workers who had their penalty rates cut, otherwise they would have come in and spoken up about them before. They just wanted to see those small businesses with a non-unionised workforce placed at a competitive disadvantage, and to have those workers have to go over to their big-end-of-town competitorsâand, of course, cough up their union fees. That is all this debate is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard a few other comments from other members. The member for Bass raised power billsâwell, if the member for Bass is so concerned about the cost of electricity in this nation, I hope he will get behind the recommendations made by the ACCC, and reduce the subsidies that are currently flowing and being added onto everyone's electricity bills. If the member for Bass is fair dinkum, he will get behind those recommendations, and he will stand up and say, 'I support every single one of the ACCC's recommendations.' But, Deputy Speaker, five will get you ten that there's not a chance of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we had the hypocrisy on the corporate rate of tax. We live in an internationally competitive environment. Our companies have to compete around the world for capital and for workers. We currently have a situation where the US have lowered their corporate rate of tax down to 21 per cent. We have France planning to lower their corporate rate of tax from 34 per cent to 25 per cent. We have the UK, 20 to 17 per centâ<span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  What's happening in the Australian economy right now is pretty clear. We need to have more consumption, we need to have a situation where there's a stimulus in the economy, and one way to do that is to ensure that the wages of people whose marginal propensity to consume is pretty high are not cut. It is a no-brainer that the last thing we should be doing right now is cutting the wages of working Australians. It's pretty clearly the case also, when you look at the Wage Price Indexâand, as you know, Deputy Speaker, it has been languishing, down at its lowest rates since we started keeping the Wage Price Index in 1997. All of these factors should make it blindingly obvious to this government that it is economic vandalism to allow the commission to be cutting wages at this time for some of the lowest-paid workers in the country. And the government has failed to do anything about this, despite the blindingly obvious nature of the problem that's before us. The government could step in and legislate to ensure that people's penalty rates are not cut. The government could step in and legislate to ensure that the commission does not reduce the take-home pay of working Australians. But the government has not only failed to do this, it is preventing the opposition from having a vote on doing these things, and I think that's deeply reckless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is trying to blame the fact that this cut has happened on the commission. The fact is: of course the commission has an obligation to review awardsâof course it does. If the commission doesn't review awards, awards become obsolete, because community standards and industry rates so far exceed the award that it is rendered useless for all except those who really want to completely underpay their workers. So you have to have reviews of awards, and those reviews of awards, of course, have to take into account more than just the base rate of pay; they should take into account penalty rates, allowances, working conditionsâall of the things that go into an award. But that's not a reason to say that we should just wash our hands of the decisions that are made in respect of the review of awards when the commission makes a decision that is so obviously wrong for our nation, for our economy, and for the people who depend on those wages. We have the opportunity right now to say to the commission: 'Look, fair enough, you are reviewing awards; you're expected to do that under the legislation. But it is up to this parliament, the sovereign parliament of this nation, to ensure that the laws that are made here are for the peace, order and good governance of this country. That requires us to take a responsible approach to our economy and our society and to the people who live within them.' Once we have taken that approach, we can see quite clearly that there needs to be legislative change to ensure that the commission knows that it is not to be reducing take-home pay of working Australians, and that's what this bill does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an opposition private member's bill. It's a private member's bill to introduce into the workplace relations legislation provisions that would preclude the commission reducing the take-home pay of working Australians. It's a very straightforward piece of legislation. It's only a couple of pages long, but it would introduce amendments to ensure that, in the process of reviewing awards, the commission does not reduce the take-home pay of Australians. Not only would it resolve the penalty rates problem that has been caused by the decision of the commission to reduce penalty rates, but it would be a method of preventing the commission making further decisions in the future that reduce the take home-pay of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's pretty rare to see a commission make a decision to reduce the take-home pay of Australians. You will remember that under Work Choices, which of course the government would love to go back to, there was a minimum pay panel, and they increased the minimum wage every year except for 2009, I think. That was one of the years. Deputy Speaker, I'm sure you remember the controversy that surrounded the decision of that panel not to increase wagesâwhich, for what it's worth, I thought was a pretty terrible decision, as we were just coming out of the global financial crisis. But to now be going a step further and have the commission reducing take-home payâgiven the economic circumstances at the moment but also, of course, as a general propositionâshould be, and is, even more controversial. That's why you're seeing no matter where you goâwhether in the Longman by-election or the streets of my suburbs in the electorate of Griffithâyou are seeing people raising concerns about the fact that this government is doing nothing to prevent cuts to penalty rates and that under this government's watch the commission has cut penalty rates. This government, by allowing that to stand, is effectively responsible for cutting penalty rates. It has the chance now to fix it, and it should. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="BU8" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  Given that there are no government speakers taking the jump, I thought I would use this opportunity to say a few words about the Fair Work Amendment (Restoring Penalty Rates) Bill 2018 and the importance of maintaining penalty rates. Let's face it: when was the last time you planned your child's birthday party for a Monday morning, went to a christening on a Tuesday, invited friends to your house for a barbecue lunch on a Wednesday or went off to see the AFL Grand Final on a Thursday lunchtime? The fact is weekends exist for a reason. They help workers coordinate socialising time together, which is so vital to the health of the Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in an Australia that has become more disconnected over recent decades. We've seen a decline in the share of Australians attending church or being part of community groups such as the Scouts, the Guides, Rotary and Lions. Surveys that I've helped to have commissioned over the years have shown that the share of Australians who know their neighbours has fallen and the number of close friends that Australians can count has dwindled. So protecting the weekend is absolutely vital to building the strength of social capital in Australia. The strength of the weekend reflects the ability of a society to get together to enjoy life. The purpose of life is not to work. It is terrific when we add to GDP, but GDP is not the sole benchmark of the performance of a society. When we have strong weekends, when people can get together with their friends and neighbours, we are healthier as a society. Frankly, things work a lot better in a society with a high degree of social capital and civic connectedness. Playing sport, being part of a union, attending religious services and supporting community life are fundamental to the kind of Australia that many people want to live in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet we've seen attempts from the conservative side of politics to hack into penalty rates. This is the side of politics that often touts its 'family values' credentials and says that it is the party that believes in supporting families. But what can be more fundamental to family values than the ability of someone to know that they will be able to attend a child's birthday party, take their kids to sport on weekends and not have their weekends treated by their employer like any other day? Those who are working on the weekends ought to be properly remunerated. Those who are working as baristas or waitstaff are workers who are spending time away from their family, and it is appropriate that they are compensated through the system of penalty rates which defend the weekend.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Penalty rates are a bulwark against the attempt of unchecked market forces to take over the weekend and to corporatise the weekend. When baristas and waitstaff spend time away from their friends and family, often the cafe or restaurant will put in place a surcharge for Sundays and public holidays. I don't think anyone in this place begrudges paying that surcharge, because that recognises that you're there enjoying socialising at a time when others are working to literally put the food on your table. The money that goes to penalty rates disproportionately goes to those who are at the lower end of the income spectrum. The weekly minimum wage set by the Restaurant Industry Award is not much over $600, less than half the average median wage. Those getting penalty rates aren't using them to go off and buy yachts; they're putting them into paying the family bills. So penalty rates go back into the economy. I know there are some business leaders who love to have low-paid workers and high-paid customers. Sadly, workers and customers are the same group of people. If you cut the pay of workers, particularly those workers who are spending their whole pay cheque, then you cut the amount of money that goes back into the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To treat Saturday and Sunday as standard days of the working week would mean that shop assistants, petrol station workers, bakers and hundreds of other kinds of workers would lose their penalty rates. Penalty rates have a long and distinguished history, going back to 1947, and they reflect the simple notion that at least three-quarters of Australians supportâthat penalty rates are an Australian value and an egalitarian value. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm thrilled this government is continuing its strong support of our volunteers. Volunteers are the lifeblood of our local community, organisations and groups. They make a real difference. I'm proud to recognise the outstanding volunteers in my electorate every year with the Bonner Volunteer Awards, and I'm proud to be part of a government that is supporting their efforts with $20 million for the 2018 Volunteer Grants round. There are more than 8.7 million volunteers across Australia who make an estimated annual economic and social contribution of $290 billion. Volunteers help people into jobs and reduce social marginalisation. They help increase community participation. By helping people come together and work alongside each other, they help build a stronger and safer community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've gotten to know so many of my fantastic volunteers in my electorate. I've spoken here before about the men and women who've been nominated for my volunteer awards. They come from all walks of life and from many different backgrounds, but deep down they're the sameâhardworking, selfless, giving up their free time to help others and never asking for recognition or reward. There are many amazing volunteers that I want to talk about today, but, in the interests of time, I want to single out Mrs Irene Edwards OAM from Manly West. Irene epitomises the very best qualities of a volunteer. She's done so much for the community over many years. She's been a volunteer, team leader, management committee member and historical officer at Wynnum &amp; Manly District Meals on Wheels for over 30 years. In that time, she's helped countless elderly locals. She's provided them with good meals, and, better yet, with the love and support of a good friend. You couldn't find a more skilled or passionate fundraiser.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been working with Meals on Wheels to get their new kitchen and community centre up and running in Wakerley. Irene was a major driving force in raising over $1.5 million towards the new centre. She has also helped local veterans fundraising for the National Servicemen's Association of Australia, Brisbane East Branch, for over a decade. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Irene has touched the lives of so many in the Wynnum-Manly community. Her work has not gone unnoticed. She has received the Medal of Merit from the Lions Club of Moreton Bay, as well as the Paul Harris Fellowship Award from the Rotary Club of Wynnum and Manly for her volunteer work. In June, His Excellency the Honourable Paul de Jersey AC, Governor of Queensland, presented her with a medal of the Order of Australia for her services to the community. Unfortunately, she was too ill to attend Government House for the general presentation, so in a very touching and rare display the Governor actually paid her a home visit for a private investiture ceremony. Her husband, Ken, tells me it was a wonderful experience for them, their children and their grandchildren who attended. Irene was deeply humbled and proud to accept this high honour. Ken tells me that she still can't believe it. Well, I and many others in the community can, and we thank her for everything that she has done for us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  I was delighted after the last election to be appointed by Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, as the shadow minister for charities and not-for-profits. It's the first time that either major party has had a portfolio for charities and not-for-profits, reflecting Labor's strong belief in the charitable sector. I acknowledge the important work also being done by Senator Louise Pratt in her role of working with volunteers. It indicates very clearly Labor's strong support for our voluntary sector. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that strong support for the voluntary sector hasn't been reciprocated by both sides of the House. We have seen two open lettersâone to Prime Minister Abbott and another to Prime Minister Turnbullâfrom the charity sector, complaining about attacks on the charity sector. The most recent letter was signed by Volunteering Australia, Carers Australia, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Community Council of Australia, Justice Connect, Philanthropy Australia and the Starlight Children's Foundation. The fact is the Liberals have brought charities togetherâagainst their retrograde policies. This government has had five ministers responsible for the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission: Kevin Andrews, Scott Morrison, Christian Porter, Michael McCormack and Michael Sukkar.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you. And we saw a period from 2011 to 2016 in which the Liberals were trying to close down the charities commission. Being unable to get that legislation through the parliament, they have now backed off in trying to shut down the charities commission and instead have appointed as head of the charities commission, Gary Johns, a noted critic of charities, who has referred to Recognise as the 'officially sanctioned propaganda arm of the Australian government', who has said that Australia is 'sucking in the wrong type of immigrant' and who has described poor women in Australia as 'cash cows'. We have seen from this government the appointment of a charities commissioner in the hours after the marriage equality vote passed the parliamentânot the moment you make the kind of announcement of which you are proud. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government, we have just seen attack after attack on the charitable sector. The most recent has been the attempt by the Liberal government, under the guise of banning foreign political donationsâa measure that Labor supports and which we have voluntarily implemented, unlike the Liberalsâto wrap in charities to try to stop the important issue advocacy work of charities being funded by overseas donations. This would prevent, for example, anti-tuberculosis work and support by New Zealanders of a state based charity that has helped their children. Indeed, one charity was concerned that it might be necessary, before religious organisations pass around the collection plate, for churches to say, 'If you're not a citizen, don't put money in the plate.' That's what they were concerned about. So we've seen from this government much warm talk in public forums about the value of volunteering, but when it comes to action we've seen quite the opposite: these continued attacks on charities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have in Australia many worthy volunteers. In my role as shadow minister for charities and not-for-profits, I've been holding forums across the country. We've held 14 such forums now, with more than 1,200 charities, speaking with them about ideas that other charities and not-for-profits can learn from in order to build community. Labor is keen to work with Justice Connect on their Fix Fundraising campaign and to work with states and territories to reduce the paperwork burden on charities by having the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission serve as a one-stop shop, akin to an ASIC for charities. We want to work with the charitable sector, and we're keen to boost volunteering in Australia. According to the census, the volunteering rate's gone up a little, from 18 to 19 per cent from 2006 to 2016, but the General Social Survey tells us it's gone down from 34 to 31 per cent from 2006 to 2014. Either way, we're not seeing a massive upsurge in volunteering, which is what Labor would like to work on with a strong and constructive relationship with our charitable sector.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  We've got many valuable assets on the Sunshine Coast: world-class beaches, our glorious hinterland, our cutting-edge healthcare facilities and our innovative businesses. But our most important asset is our people and the thousands of committed volunteers in Fisher who give up their time to make our community a better place for everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of these local assets is Kevin Stroud, who won the Fisher Senior of the Year award at my community awards in March. After arriving on the coast in 1976, Kevin has constantly been giving up his own time to help others. He's been the President of Met Cal Nippers, he's volunteered with Caloundra junior rugby league and he has been a member of the Sunshine Coast referees for 30 years. Since 2011, he's also found time to commit himself to TS Onslow Australian Navy Cadets, where he's been the president and a petty officer instructor, giving up his Wednesday night activities for training and his weekends for these young cadets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Margaret Smythe, along with her husband David, is a cornerstone of the Caloundra community. Between them, the couple volunteer for 110 hours every week to manage the CCSA Hall. Margaret needs little prompting to speak passionately about the community events and meetings which collectively bring 900 visitors to the hall every week. Margaret and her team of volunteers prepare the hall for dancing, stage performances, community meetings, charity groups and much more. When she isn't moving chairs and tables, she's working on grant applications to improve this vital and much-loved facility with upgrades like the new curtains recently funded by the Turnbull government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ivon Northage is another of our valuable local volunteers. Ivon lives in the shadow of Mount Beerwah in the beautiful Glass House Mountains. Those iconic mountains have been an inspiration to him and, over 15 years of volunteering at the Glass House Mountains information centre, he has in turn been an inspiration to thousands of visitors to our region. Ivon works tirelessly to promote understanding and appreciation of our beautiful mountains locally and to draw more tourists to our region. He's constantly called upon to give presentations in local schools, government organisations and community groups and to train other volunteers. Last year, with the help of a $10,000 grant from the Turnbull government and together with Celebrate Glasshouse Country, he wrote and published a book, <span style="font-style:italic;">The National Heritage Listed Glasshouse Mountains</span>. When I visited him this year, Ivon took me on a personal tour of the region he knows so well. After just a few hours, I had no doubt of the huge debt of gratitude our community owes him for the knowledge and the passion that he has instilled in both locals and tourists alike.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government currently has three separate grants available to volunteers just like Kevin, Margaret and Ivon and the groups they represent. Just a moment ago, the member for Fenner talked about Labor, but that's all it was: talk. We walk the talk on this side of the House. Our Volunteer Grants program offers funding packages of between $1,000 and $5,000 for volunteer costs like fuel, training, fundraising and small-scale equipment. The Stronger Communities Program allocates $150,000 to the electorate of Fisher and every other electorate in this country for small grants between $2,500 to $20,000 to support the purchase of new equipment or new and upgraded facilities. Finally, the government has also launched a community sport infrastructure grant program offering funds of up to $500,000 to undertake projects which will build participation in physical activity. All of these grants are currently open, and interested groups in my electorate should contact my office as soon as possible to find out how to get involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These grant rounds are only the latest manifestation of the exceptional commitment demonstrated time and again by this Turnbull government to supporting community groups in Fisher. In the past two years, we've provided around $750,000 in smaller grants to volunteer-led community organisations in Fisher. Some have been substantial, like the $231,000 for upgrades to the Palmwoods Memorial Hall, but the Turnbull government has also recognised that sometimes it is the small-scale grants that can be the helping hand volunteers need to make a difference to people's lives. On this side of the House, we walk the talk when it comes to volunteers. Volunteers are the backbone of our community, and this government will back them to the hilt.</span>

I'm particularly proud to speak in support of the volunteers from the 830 or so community groups scattered across the electorate of Moretonâsome small, some large, all running on the sweat and love of volunteers. There is no doubt about the enormous contribution that our local volunteers make to our society. I'm very fortunate that I get to see their wonderful work everywhere I go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently rolled out my Say G'day in May campaign in Moreton. The aim of the campaign was to introduce locals to community groups that are already up and running in the area. I walked around my electorateâmore than 60 kilometresâvisiting community groups, walking and talking with local individuals, and spreading the word about volunteering or joining the fantastic community groups that are servicing the south side and beyond. The campaign culminated in the community group showcase, where more than 30 community groups set up stalls with information about what they do, how to join them and how to volunteer so that locals had a face to meet, because often the first and most difficult part of joining a community group is walking through the door into the first meeting. The feedback was extremely positive, and it's likely to become a yearly event in Moretonâalthough who knows what we'll be doing in May next yearâso I look forward to hooking people up with their community, making us a stronger and safer place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What struck me most was how generous and caring most people are and that they're keen to get more involved, especially once they have been asked or given an opportunity to step forward. A big shout-out to just a few of my local community groupsâfrom the Say G'day in May campaign, I particularly want to mention West Side Community Services, St David's Neighbourhood Centre, Cathay Community Association, Yeronga Community Plus, Braille House, Deaf Services Queensland and Cerebral Palsy League. These groups cannot operate without the immense contributions of their volunteersâordinary locals who give up their time for the benefit of others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year, in January, we in Moreton recognise the wonderful contribution of volunteers. We have a special ceremony, normally held around Australia Day, to recognise our wonderful volunteers. These awards are to celebrate the spirit of volunteerism in our local community. This year I handed out the 10th anniversary Moreton community service awards. Annually, one volunteer out of all the nominees is awarded the Sir James Killen AwardâSir James was a previous member for Moretonâfor their outstanding contribution to volunteering in Moreton.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, Lady Bernice Killen, on behalf of her late husband, presented the Sir James Killen Award to Joan McGrath. Joan has been the treasurer of the Salisbury Moorooka St Vincent de Paul Conference. She has been the touchpoint for many locals from Moorooka, Rocklea, Annerley and Salisbury and beyond who are experiencing hardship. Her role involved coordinating the resources to maximise assistance with rent, utilities, food vouchers, school resources and much more for these locals who need a helping hand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joan McGrath's commitment to social justice and building community is also reflected in her work with the local refugee community. Again through St Vincent de Paul, Joan participated in local settlement services to provide support, advocacy and information to some of our newest Australians, helping to make them contributing members of society. Other volunteers obviously are doing similar work, but I wanted to particularly call out Joan McGrath. These other volunteers who are making the south side stronger and safer include Lisa Briggs, from the Sherwood Australian Breastfeeding Association; Brian Tovey, from Oxley Neighbourhood Watch; Phyllis Stockwell, from the Bethesda Caring Centre; Bill Elliott, from Yeronga Men's Shed and Annerley-Stephens History Group; Naomi Frampton and Paul Hodges, from Annerley Community Bookshop; Ruby Luder, from Yeronga Dutton Park RSL; Julie Segal, from the Kurilpa Scouts; the Reverend Heather Griffin for her work promoting community harmony; Mary Jane Lepre, from St David's Neighbourhood Centre; Colleen Williamson, from Omega International foodbank; Craig Schooth, the vice-president of Runcorn State School P&amp;C; Lyn Cassar, the president of Kuraby Special School P&amp;C; Leonie Hoey, from Lloyd Rees Park; Robin Blackson, from the Yeronga Anglican Church op shop; Ron Goeldner, from Yeronga Districts Residents Association, St Sebastian's P&amp;F, Hyde Road kindy, the RSL, the local NHW and many moreâwell done RonâDenis Peel, from the Annerley Stephens History Group; Jacquie Rogerson, from the Sunnybank Scout Group; Paul Rogerson and Michelle Flooder, from Scouts; Thomas Yuen and Rex Low, from the Australian Cantonese Association; Michelle Gadke, Michelle Langley-Taylor and Raina Davies, from Belong; Maria Hong, from the Australian Cantonese Association; and Willy Frommolt, from St David's Neighbourhood Centre. I could go on. There are many others I could mention, from the tuckshops, P&amp;Cs and sporting clubs, and they should all be commended.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  I thank the member for Bonner for moving this most important motion on volunteering, and I join him in recognising the fantastic contributions that volunteers have made in Chisholm and across communities in Australia. Indeed, the volunteering spirit in our local community in Chisholm is outstanding, and it has been my great honour since becoming the federal member for Chisholm to meet all the amazing volunteers locally who give of their time to support our community. The energy, expertise and time our volunteers give in Chisholm support those who are most in need and represent what Australian communities are all about: giving a helping hand. From the mums and dads coaching and supporting sports teams to dedicated tutors welcoming migrants and refugees, from environmental conservationists to amateur historians, the thousands of volunteers across Chisholm embody the best of Aussie mateship by reducing social marginalisation and increasing community participation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm delighted to be hosting the annual Chisholm Volunteer Awards again this Friday, where over 70 local volunteers will be celebrated for their hard work and volunteerism. I'll be presenting the awards again with the foreign minister, the Hon. Julie Bishop. The awards give us the opportunity to recognise, pay tribute to and warm-heartedly thank so many of the volunteers who dedicate their own time and commitment, sometimes on an individual basis and sometimes as part of a wider community group. The Chisholm Volunteer Awards recognise outstanding individuals who tirelessly give of their own time for the benefit of others. Indeed, all the awardees are so incredibly deserving of these awards, as they have been nominated by other members in the Chisholm community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While volunteers give so much to our community, the awards give us the chance to give back to them and to recognise them. As was last year's ceremony, which the foreign minister also attended, this year's ceremony will be a testament to the contribution of all our Chisholm volunteers and the way the Turnbull government wishes to publicly recognise and reward the large contribution made by these volunteers. I'm immensely proud that in addition to the local initiatives recognising the wonderful spirit of volunteers across our communities the Turnbull government is ensuring that our local volunteer organisations in Chisholm will have support to continue their valuable work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteering is in the DNA of Australians, and I am proud to say that the Turnbull government's Volunteer Grants round of approximately $20 million has officially opened. I strongly encourage and will be working with all Chisholm volunteer organisations to apply for this wonderful funding support opportunity which works to build stronger and safer communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my greatest honour and privilege to meet with the numerous wonderful people in many volunteer groups across Chisholm, and to have witnessed firsthand the incredible gift of compassion and civic responsibility that Chisholm locals embody. There are hundreds of people across Chisholm who demonstrate the wonderful Aussie spirit of volunteerism, who show kindness and caring every day, and who work way above and beyond the call of duty and give of their own time selflessly. There are over 200 volunteers at Box Hill Hospital, and a similar number in the Uniting Church group, as well as the wonderful people at Crossway LifeCare, the folks at Ashwood College Permaculture Food Garden, the various Rotary and RSL groups in Chisholm, Sally and Tony Walker, the dynamic duo leading the Scotchman's Creek and Valley Reserve, Judith Clancy and the team from Neighbourhood Watch, and people such as Tom Thorpe and Ed Bright from the Wattle Park Heritage Group, who are maintaining a wonderful piece of local heritage in Australia's first Lone Pine, planted and grown and passionately maintained in Chisholm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Communities like Chisholm are strengthened and enriched by the many passionate threads maintained and supported by volunteers. People who sacrifice their time for the betterment of our local community and people who, through the goodness of their character, give of their own time. I'm extremely proud to be their voice here in Chisholm. I've spent much of my time working with volunteers and supporting them in their wonderful work for the Australian community. I very much look forward to formally acknowledging a cross-section of individuals at this Friday's awards, the second annual Chisholm awards event, at which a congregation of all these amazing people will celebrate volunteerism in Chisholm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteerism is in the DNA of all Australians and is well represented in the people of Chisholm, and I'm very proud to be their voice here in Canberra. I very much look forward to acknowledging a cross-section of individuals this Friday. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

                  <a href="249224" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  I also commend this motion to the House. Celebrating our volunteers is one of the most important things local members can do in their communities. Having grown up in the community I represent, I know firsthand the value of those in our community who go the extra mile, and who take a personal passion and build from it to a shared passion that adds to the lives of our residents and the fabric of our community. In Lalor, we turn housing developments into communities, and we do that because we're building communities from the ground up. It requires an enormous amount of energy from our local residents to build those communities, and most of that work is done through volunteerism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own history, I owe an enormous debt to such people. As a youngster I was involved in many sports, but one became my passionâno surprise to this chamber that that sport is netball. Through netball, I met and was influenced by some amazing women, who gave of themselves tirelessly and had an enormous impact on many lives. I think about them every year at our Lalor Heroes Volunteer Awards, and about the service they gave to our community through my lifetime. I think of Irene Cooney, of Jenny Toohey and of Wilma Ryan, from whom I learnt so much, not least of which was about service to the community. They led by leading us younger people on the court and at meetings, and they taught us how to serve our community as well. That has grown as the City of Wyndham and surrounds have grown.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014 I initiated the Lalor Heroes Volunteer Awards and have been absolutely overwhelmed by the number of people that we have celebrated. It's designed to acknowledge their efforts. It's designed to celebrate the community that we are building together. Nominations for the Lalor heroes awards are open now, so I urge those at home to think about the people who they see working in their community and giving of themselves every week. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2017 Lalor Heroes were an extraordinary group. Margaret Campbell has given 50 years of volunteering in our community, and is celebrated as a Lalor Hero. In that time, she's been a board member for the Wyndham Community and Education Centre, and she's been involved in the Werribee community legal centre, the citizens advice bureau, the Werribee Red Cross, Meals on Wheels and the Werribee information network. She's been a campaigner for Aboriginal reconciliation and justice and she wrote a local history of Werribee, <span style="font-style:italic;">From There to Here</span>. It's people like this that we are celebrating, who give every week to their communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Robert Bradley was another 2017 Lalor hero. He's a Wyndham honorary justice of the peace and heads up that group in our community. He's an executive member and roster coordinator for that, and he works tirelessly, purely for the benefit of others. Lisa Heinrichs, a very well-known local, is always volunteering. She is a member of Wyndham Heritage Recovery. She chaired the 'Not in Werribee South' campaign and is a community activist. She also conducts tours to historical sites in Wyndham. She's incredibly passionate about the local community, and she was another that we celebrated that night. Another was Miwako Okumura, who founded Eat my Garden. She's an organiser of the Echo Action Fun school holiday program. She believes in the potential of local communities and children and gives back to the environment and works with NatureWest to foster a happy and healthy community in Lalor. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of these people are from sporting groups, as I've said. Nathan Jenner was a Lalor hero last year for his work with the Tenpin Bowling Association of Victoria. He's a local tenpin bowling coach and he works extremely hard with the junior bowlers to support their growth. He's always there to help. Another person that we've celebrated in previous years is a bloke named Wally. He runs Carpet Bowls for All Abilities. I've visited this recently on two occasions over the break. I have never had a wider smile on my face than I did when I shared some time with this group of people and with Wally and his wife, Dot, who ensure this group meets twice a week. When we say 'all abilities', we've got a group of people gathering there, some lonelyâmaybe they've just lost their partner in their later yearsâsome with a brain injury, some who have special needs. To see 70 people roll up, get the carpet rolled out and get the teams goingâthat is building the fabric of our community. I'd encourage all locals to think about the people they know and get their nominations in and I'd also encourage them to look at the community grants that are open right now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  I rise to speak about the important work volunteers do in our community and Australia. I'd like to thank my friend and colleague the member for Bonner for bringing this motion to the House and also the member for Lalor, who was talking about the community grants. I think we, as members of parliament, all participate in that program to make sure community groups in our electorates get the maximum benefit from it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteering is something that's become ingrained in what it means to be an Australian. Our cultural identity is bound by mateship, loyalty and a fair go. Aussies are always more than willing to lend a helping hand as we strive to give back to our own communities. There are almost nine million volunteers across Australia. These volunteers are within our local sporting clubs, churches, schools and charities and provide ongoing support within our communities. These volunteers donate large amounts of their time, energy and sometimes even their own money, and do so often without thanks. Our volunteers are Australia's unsung heroes and so, on behalf of the House and my electorate of Swan, I want to take a quick moment to thank each of those almost nine million volunteers across Australia for their commitment to serve our communities. Our communities are richer and stronger for the work you do. Volunteers are at the heart of Australian society and are strongly supported by those on this side of the chamber as well as those opposite. Many of us would have spent time before we came to this place working as volunteers in community organisations. I spent five years with the local junior football club and then with Perth Football Club doing volunteer work with them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side believe that bigger governments can't provide what those on the ground can do. We believe the best kind of work is done at the grassroots level, where those closest to the coalface know what's best for them. Community spirit that's built from community volunteers is an enormous boon to this society, and I encourage anyone who's thinking about volunteering to be involved. By way of background, here are some statistics on our volunteers in Australia. In 2010, the volunteer rates for adults by age group were: 27 per cent for 18- to 24-year-olds, 30 per cent for 25- to 34-year-olds, 42 per cent for 35- to 44-year-olds, 44 per cent for 45- to 54-year-olds, 43 per cent for 55- to 64-year-olds and 31 per cent for those 65 and over. That equates to 36.2 per cent of Australia's adult population, 35 per cent of which are volunteering at least once a week and are prime examples of how committed Australians are to volunteering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The hard work of our volunteers is fantastic. The impact of volunteering across Australia is estimated to produce an annual economic and social contribution of $290 billion. For context, this figure is almost double the Department of Social Services' 2018-19 budget. If it was to be fulfilled by the government, it would require an extra $11,600 in tax from every person in Australia just to match the contribution that our volunteers make to this great country of ours. The coalition government has allocated $20 million to support our volunteers across the country. In doing so, we acknowledge the hard work they continue to do day in and day out to support our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I'm sure is the case for most members in this chamber, volunteers are the heart and soul of the community in my electorate of Swan. I thank them all for making our community a wonderful place. There are hundreds of volunteer organisations that reside in my electorate that provide services to help support and improve the lives of many. There are sporting organisations like the Victoria Park Raiders Junior Football Club, whose many members put in more than 20 hours a week to support the club and ensure the players can make the games. On Saturday I attended the Perth Football Club pre-game lunch. Another prime example was the presentation to Keith Collins at the Perth Football Club, who received a magnificent trophy for 30 years of unpaid and unsung work at the Perth Football Club. He was then asked to do the raffle draw, and his humility stood out. To Keith Collins and all the volunteers in the community of Swan and around Australia, I congratulate you and encourage you to keep doing the fabulous work that we all appreciate that you do.</span>

I would like to point out to people, particularly in my constituency, that volunteer grants are now open for community groups and organisations to apply for. The applications close on 18 September. The grants are between $1,000 and $5,000 and are available to help not-for-profit community organisations or groups to support their volunteers through practical measures such as the purchase of small equipment items, reimbursement for volunteers' fuel and transportation costs and contributions towards the cost of training and background screening checks. I would encourage all of the volunteers, particularly in my constituency, to apply for these grants. I know that the financial assistance will make a real difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Holt, as we've heard in other presentations so far, we have many wonderful volunteers. In the constituency of Holt, each Australia Day we conduct the Holt Australia Day Awards to highlight the local unsung heroes who volunteer their time and who make a real difference in the community. One of the great volunteers who received one of the Holt Australia Day Awards this year was Aaron Grant. Aaron is a young man who has been a tireless volunteer on the committee for the Cranbourne Public Hall. Aaron can often be found working in the gardens or on jobs that need to be done, including painting the hall. Aaron also helps run the 'Casey Crime Page' on Facebook. He is the young man who helped start it up. It has 43,000 followers. He works full time, in addition to being a member of the blue light disco and Spirit of Cranbourne, whilst helping out unconditionally with many other community fundraisers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming back to the Casey crime Facebook page, it really is a very good reference point. When things do happen in the south-eastern suburbs you can often obtain a lot of useful information by accessing that particular page. To have 43,000 followers, I think, says something about the credibility of that Facebook page. I would like to thank him in particular for the work that he does in maintaining that page and putting up up-to-date, accurate information for people that need it, because we have had some challenges in the south-east, particularly with some crime that's occurred down there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking more about Aaron, he is a very generous young man. For example, during the significant fires in Carrum Downs over the summer period, Aaron purchased 1,200 icy poles and delivered them to the firefighters, volunteers, police and other emergency service workers. He also runs drives for the homeless and is currently involved in a drive for the Cranbourne Information and Support Service for the back-to-school program. In addition, Aaron has been the instigator of several GoFundMe pages to support community members who have had family members either critically injured or killed in accidents. I take the opportunity in this House to congratulate Aaron Grant for volunteering his precious time to so many local causes in Cranbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">About the Cranbourne area, I would also like to highlight the volunteer work of Lyn and Barry Leeds from the Cranbourne Information and Support Service. Lyn and Barry live at the Blue Hills Rise retirement village and they work with Sue Owen to raise funds. The money raised by Lyn and Barry is then used to supply new mums bags, homeless persons packs, Christmas gifts and vouchers for the back-to-school support program. Each year a good portion of the funds raised is used to purchase food and vouchers for large hampers to be given to families and individuals in need at Christmas time. This year over 40 hampers, weighing 12 kilos each, were distributed. Lyn and Barry assist Sue with the purchasing of the goods required, pack the bags and hampers, and help deliver them to CISS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are two very good people that help maintain essential services. I call them volunteers, the glue that helps bind our community together and keep our community together. They often do it in a very quintessentially Australian way: they are not looking for recognition. But I would like to recognise two groups of people in this place. I would like this House to note the service that they have given to their community.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  Thank you to my friend and colleague the member for Bonner for raising this important topic. I note the motion recognises the volunteers of Bonner, and while I'm sure they are a formidable bunch I find it hard to believe that they could compare with the incredibly enterprising and caring volunteers of Bennelong. Volunteering at its core is the belief in helping one another. It is a noble Australian tradition to volunteer by lending a hand to those in need, and every day I'm encouraged by the wonderful work done by the volunteers in my electorate of Bennelong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across our large and diverse community there are volunteers from all walks of life helping others in all manner of ways. Groups such as Rotary and the Lions Club routinely work in conjunction with government resources to extend their benefit to the community at large. Of the many organisations in my community, I would like to inform the House of a few particular ones that have done such good work of late.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Christian Community Aid is a local organisation focused on delivering vital services to the needy through their trained social workers and volunteer helpers. They provide numerous high-quality services. I would like to highlight their recent launch of the mobile play van, as part of their playground-in-the-park mobile playgroup program. The van will be able to provide structured play resources to aid in early childhood development and will develop skills such as literacy, numeracy, science, construction, art, craft, music, group activities and imaginative play. The van's mobility means it can reach families across the electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">CCA has a particular focus on engaging culturally and linguistically diverse families, which is very beneficial in Bennelong as we have a proud and strong multicultural community. CCA aims to have 50 per cent of playgroups targeting children and their grandparents of Chinese background, as evidence suggests these families face greater obstacles to accessing vital early-childhood learning resources. I would like to congratulate everyone at CCAâthe incredible Heather Pinto and her team, and particularly Petrana Barac-Dunnâfor organising the van's launch recently on 9 August. A great many members of our community, including representatives of Rotary and me, were present, and we were greatly impressed by CCA's efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to add that this project has only come about through generous grants from the federal government's Stronger Community Partnership grant program, which makes high-quality, valuable projects such as these viable. I look forward to seeing what other projects are successful through this program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are volunteers at all levels of our society making our community run smoothly and ensuring that everybody has access to the services and opportunities they need to thrive. Among the great groups that devote time and effort in return for nothing at all are the school P&amp;Cs, which enrich the lives of our students and our schools. Locally they've been instrumental in facilitating other grants to enrich our schools. In particular, I would like to focus on two most recent successful recipients of the Armistice Centenary project grants. Epping Boys High School P&amp;C Association have received a generous grant to establish a memorial garden on their school grounds for students to remember and pay tribute to the sacrifice of past students during the First World War. Additionally, Karonga School in Epping have also been successful in receiving a grant to construct a commemorative garden memorial and education program for their students to learn about the sacrifice that so many Australians made during the First World War.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to these groups and, indeed, to all the thousands of volunteers who help the people of Bennelong. Many of you are silent toilers working forever in the background and never seeing the congratulations and thanks you deserve, so I would like to say thank you on behalf of all of us. Thank you for your tireless efforts to make our community a better place and to ensure everybody has a fair go and that nobody gets left behind. Volunteers are the best part of our society and deserve the highest praise this House can offer.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  I thank the member for Bonner for moving this motion, because it gives me an opportunity to acknowledge some extraordinary people in the community of Parramatta who give their time and their capacity to make a difference in the lives of others. In my electorate of Parramatta, 21,001 people over the age of 15 volunteered in the last 12 months. That's 14 per cent of people in that age group, or one in six, who did unpaid volunteer work for an organisation or group over a 12-month period. That's an extraordinary contribution. Bravo to all the people who made that contribution to our community. You make a very real difference. I can't name you all, but I will name some today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parramatta Mission, as most of us know, provides meals, accommodation and mental health services across Greater Western Sydney, with almost 500 staff and many, many volunteers delivering more than 70 services across the community. They provide assistance to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our communities to assist them in transforming their lives. Meals Plus is open for breakfast and lunch from Monday to Friday, and it provides over 35,000 meals to disadvantaged people each year. The wonderful Meals Plus is composed largely of volunteers, including Wilhelmina Goodridge, who is relatively new to Parramatta Mission. She's been volunteering in food preparation and serving for 18 months. Thank you, Wilhelmina.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Stepping Stone program has a great volunteer, John Monk. It's a joint venture between Parramatta Baptist Church and Pathways Community Church. For over 20 years John has been the cornerstone person in the program, which provides a weekly food service for the homeless or marginalised in Parramattaâtwo decades of service to his community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tamil Women's Development Group started in 2012. They are a group dedicated to working for Tamil women in Australia and northern Sri Lanka. Currently they're collaborating with the Cumberland Council on a domestic violence support program and advocacy for Tamil women. There are 10 incredible women volunteering with the Tamil Women's Development Group, including Viji Dhayanathan, a remarkable woman who I met the other day at their fundraiser doing great work for Tamil women.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Community Wheels provides transport services for those who are frail, older people, younger people with disabilities and their carers so they can live safely and comfortably in their own homes rather than in institutions such as nursing homes or hostels. I'm really honoured to mention just two of the volunteer bus helpers who assist clients to go shopping and attend social events. Joaquin Diaz and Robert Lavender are both well known to the clients of Community Wheels. Each of them has been volunteering for 11 years, an amazing contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Jesuit Refugee Service advocates for refugees, people seeking asylum and other forcibly displaced people in our country. Marthe Nalletamby volunteers for their Foodbank Program. She enjoys volunteering because it's an opportunity for her 'to pass that kindness on to those in our community who need it the most'. Marianne Dwyer enjoys volunteering for the Jesuit service because she likes to do 'something practical to support for people seeking asylum' and 'it is a privilege to welcome people to our local community'. They are just two of the many fabulous people that volunteer at Jesuit Refugee Service. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Evolve Housing is one of Australia's leading housing providers, managing over 3,400 social and affordable housing properties in New South Wales. Margaret has been a volunteer at Evolve Housing for more than seven years. Every Friday she calls the elderly who live alone to chat with them, providing much-needed social interaction and care, and she was awarded one of the Evolve volunteer awards recently and, as a prize, she was given a couple of days in a hotel in Circular Quay. It was the first time she had ever visited the cityâshe lives in Western Sydneyâand she saw the Opera House for the first time, and she's well into her 70s. But she volunteers every Friday, and she has been doing it for seven years, to phone people who are alone. What an extraordinary woman she is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the War Widows' Guild, Rhondda Vanzella OAM, the state president, does incredible work. There are a huge array of people who drive widows around and organise social eventsâan incredible group of volunteers. One of my favourites, at the Merrylands Amateur Swimming Club, is Mrs Gladys Pye. She has been a member of the club since 1968, she is a life member and she has been volunteering as swim coach and administrator for 50 yearsâ50 yearsâlending her capacity, what she knows, to people who, as we all know, need to learn to swim. What an extraordinary contributionâ50 years with a club, giving her services. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members would be aware that Brendan O'Connor's wife, Jodi Dack, passed away last week. On Friday, Brendan put out a beautiful statement letting us know that Jodi passed away surrounded by her close family, those who loved her best. Jodi was wise, she was strong, she was funny, she was gracious, she was generous and kind, and she lived life to the fullestâtraits that are so evident in their most precious daughter, Una Rose. Brendan also has tweeted an article that I would encourage people to read, by Nick Ryan in the Adelaide <span style="font-style:italic;">Advertiser</span>, that refers to Jodi's bravery without actually naming herâbut that's who it's about. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many members have got in touch with Brendan, but obviously, at this difficult time, there are no words that help and I won't pretend that there are words that help. It is simply for Brendan to know that, from all members, the sympathy is real and the sympathy is strong. The solidarity that Brendan conveys and offers so strongly himself right now is there with him and with his family. And, if more time is needed, more time will be given.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From all of us, and I'm sure I speak for both sides of the chamber, our deepest sympathies; and from those who pray, our prayers for everyone, whether they pray or not. Our thoughts are with Brendan and his family at the most difficult of times.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr LEESER:</span>
                    </a>  by leaveâI take note of the interim report of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition Relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, which was tabled out of session.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March this year the parliament appointed this committee to build on the work of the 2015 joint select committee, the 2012 expert panel, the 2017 Referendum Council and the Uluru Statement from the Heart. It tasked us with finding a way to advance the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples able to be supported by Australians from all walks of life and contribute to a more unified and reconciled nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that any proposals have the support of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and also, as our terms of reference indicate, broad parliamentary and political support as well as the support of all Australians. The joint select committee on constitutional recognition acknowledges the long history of advocacy for constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My co-chair, Senator Dodson, and I have understood the requirement for this committee to find common ground and seek a way forward on the options and issues considered and reflected in the work of those previous committees. I support the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as part of a broader project of reconciliation and recognition of their unique status in our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a committee understand the frustration many have about the length of time taken to advance these issues. However, we also note that the Uluru Statement from the Heart represents a major change in the direction of the debate about constitutional recognition, with its proposals for a voice, agreement-making and truth-telling. While the Uluru Statement gave us a direction, it didn't provide much detail as to what proposals for a voice would actually look like. Therefore the primary task of this committee is to consider and develop proposals for constitutional recognition, including the voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The range of views about what the voice might look like means that this is not a simple task. We've listened closely to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, legal experts and other Australians. The committee has put forward a range of principles and models and has asked for responses to a series of questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Interim report </span>the committee has outlined a non-exhaustive list of 15 different models of consultative bodies, which we are seeking comment on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These include past bodies like the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee, the National Aboriginal Conference and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Models that are presently operating in the public policy sphere include the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights, the Torres Strait Regional Authority, the Murdi Paaki Regional Assembly, the Prime Minister's Indigenous Advisory Council, the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body, the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples, prescribed body corporates and Aboriginal land councils.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also received indicative proposals for how a First Nations voice might work from organisations like Uphold &amp; Recognise, the Cape York Institute and Mr Eric Sidoti.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has also highlighted a non-exhaustive list of nine principles, which have come through the initial consultations we have conducted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:2.85pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">We have noted that there is strong support for the concept of the voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:2.85pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Most significant is the strong support for local and regional structures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:2.85pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">The members of the voice, whether local, regional or national, should be chosen by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples rather than appointed by government, as this will provide legitimacy and authenticity for the voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:2.85pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">The design of local voices should reflect the varying practices of different Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. A Canberra-designed one-size-fits-all model would not be supported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:2.85pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">We believe that there should be equal gender representation on the voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:2.85pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">The voice at the local, regional and national level should be used by state, territory and local governments as well as the federal government. It seems logical that, if the voice is to have a role regarding federal legislation policy and services, it should have the same or similar functions in relation to state and local government policies, laws and services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:2.85pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">The voices, whether local, regional or national, should provide oversight, advice and plans but not necessarily administer programs or money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:2.85pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">The voices should provide a forum for people to bring ideas or problems to government, and government should be able to use the voices to road test and evaluate policy. This process should work as a dialogue where the appropriateness of policy and its possible need for change should be negotiable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:2.85pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Consideration must be given to the interplay of any voice body with existing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations at both the local and national level in such areas as health, education and law, and how such organisations might work together with the voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Evidence presented to the committee and broader discussions have highlighted that the majority of day-to-day challenges facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples do not fall within the ambit of this parliament. Many of the solutions to these challenges are both local and regional.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These solutions need to be found through close political and fiscal cooperation between the Commonwealth, state, territory and regional bodies. Consequently, to be effective, any voice proposal will need to have local, regional and national elements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout our inquiry, we have asked for people's proposals and ideas on what the voice might look like and how it might best work with the Commonwealth parliament, the Australian government, the states and territories, local authorities and existing organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This <span style="font-style:italic;">Interim report</span> indicates our progress to date and outlines what we as a committee will be doing next. It sets out key areas of inquiry, asking specific questions, some 100 questions, on what a voice might strive for and how it could be designed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It acknowledges that, whatever form future proposals might take, a voice must be legitimate, representative and agreed upon between the parliament and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Design questions regarding constitutional and/or legislative change remain before us. The committee recognises that the Australian public and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples may have differing views on the need for a voice and, indeed, whether the voice should be given a constitutional guarantee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also considered in the report suggestions for agreement-making and truth-telling. We look to further comment on the appropriateness of the term 'Makarrata' and how culturally this process might help us achieve reconciliation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We encourage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the broader community to make submissions examining the principles and models outlined in chapters 3 and 4 and addressing the questions we pose in chapter 7 by 17 September this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as we foreshadowed, this report will not be the end of the process. We hope that the next round of consultations might help the committee to refine models which might form the basis for a process of deep consultation and co-design between the Australian government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in every community across Australia in order to ensure that the detail of the voice and related proposals are authentic for each community in the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the members of the committee and record my particular thanks and appreciation to Senator Dodson. He and I have a approached this task with goodwill, acknowledging the difficulty of the task but also focusing on the things which we can agree on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the members of the committee: Senator Duniam, Senator McCarthy, Senator Siewert and Senator Stoker and the members for Barton, Farrer, Lingiari, Indi and Wide Bay. I note that the member for Barton is here. Many of those members, including the member for Barton, bring with them a lifetime of experience in Indigenous policy and they have been very generous with sharing their insights and experience with other members of the committee, and for that I'm very grateful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank and acknowledge the secretariat for the work they have done, as well as the office of Senator Dodson and my own office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee, we would like to acknowledge and thank members of the public who have worked with us to this point, and we look forward to their ongoing input as we continue this important journey.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="8GH" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURNEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  by leaveâI rise to join with the member for Berowra in his tabling of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Interim report</span> on constitutional recognition for First Peoples. I also recognise, as the member for Berowra has, his leadership as the joint chair of the committee, along with Senator Patrick Dodson. I understand that this is quite an unusual arrangement when it comes to select committees, but I think it's important and appropriate, particularly when you look at the subject that we're exploring in relation to this topic, that it be a joint committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to say that one of the challenges, of course, as outlined also by the member for Berowra, is for this parliament to welcome this <span style="font-style:italic;">Interim report</span> and then the final report in November. In the sense of not being on the wrong side of history, I think the nation is very readyâcertainly from my discussions and interactions over the past 12 monthsâfor an Indigenous voice to this parliament. It's really important that we are clear on what the Referendum Council said. They did not say that this voice would have any veto powers over the parliament. I think it's mischievous that there are intimations that this might be the case. They recommended that this voice would be advisory only and it would be up to this parliament to actually sort out and work out how it would operate, which of course has been the work of the select committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a complex task but, interestingly, there have been very real themes that have evolved about the need for the voice to be elected so that it's legitimate. Many people have said that it needs to have a regional base. Obviously the one thing that everyone has recognised, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, legal and non-legal, is that the sovereignty of this parliament has to be upheld and protected, and I think that that's very much understood, and I think that's the most important thing for people to keep in mind at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems to me also that it would be very wrong for this parliament to reject the views, yet again, of First Nations peoples when it comes to self-determination and when it comes to putting a reality around the words that we have said in this parliament many, many times. Both the Prime Minister and others have said that we want to work with Aboriginal people and work alongside them, and this is a perfect opportunity to do that. The discussions that we've had around the countryâand there will be moreâhave been very deep and meaningful, in the sense that there has been a consideration of history, of the social circumstances of First Peoples and, of course, of the richness of the story of this nation and what First Peoples' stories bring to this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am disappointed, however, in the fact that the Prime Minister, as recently as last week, has dismissed the idea of the Uluru statement and has dismissed the idea of a voice, even before the <span style="font-style:italic;">Interim report</span> was tabled. I think that the fact that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Interim report</span> and the submissions made to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Interim report</span> overwhelmingly support the proposal of a voice to the parliament is something that we as members of this parliament need to hear quickly and clearly. The Prime Minister said that a referendum would be undesirable and unwinnable, and he is misleading this place and the country when the voice is being described as a third chamber of the parliament. It is nothing of the sort.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been great discussion in our consultations about the value of a regional model. We've heard from many communities about the importance of grassroots people, local people, having a say, and, hopefully, that is happening through this process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think, though, that there is a real danger that the final report could be tabled in November, and not see the light of day again. I hope that that is not the case. I also hope very much that we avoid dog-whistle politics in this debate. It is not what we need. It is not what this country wants. And it's certainly not what First Nations people want. The issue cannot be ignored. This aspiration of First Nations people cannot be dismissed. We in this parliament have a responsibility to listenâas we say in our rhetoric.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish up by saying this: the <span style="font-style:italic;">Interim report</span> shows that the committee has had some very productive and constructive conversations on what a voice to parliament can achieve, and how it can be achieved. It notes strong support for a voice to parliament including from the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples, the Australian Bar Association, and the Indigenous Peoples Organisation. It notes a voice such as this is not unprecedented internationally, citing several examples, including South Africa. In fact, I attended an international conference just recently, held here in Canberra and hosted by the Australian National University, where we heard a number of speakers from other first-world nations with a colonial history and a story such as ours who talked about various models that have been in existence in their countries for a long time without the sky falling in. Surely, it is time for Australia to do the same.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Interim report</span> notes a voice such as this is not unprecedented and cites several examples from across the world. In terms of design, the committee heard about the need for a national voice to include local and regional structures. Submissions have also called for a First Nations voice to be received at state, territory and local government levels, as state and local laws continue to affect First Nations people equally with federal laws. Submissions have typically called for members of the voice to be chosen by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and for an equal gender representation. What came across very strongly, in terms of the construction of this voice, whichever way we do it, is that it has to have gender parity. I'm extremely pleased to see that as one of the main and very loud calls that have come out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The joint standing committee recognised that legitimacy and concrete details presented political challenges to a voice to parliament, and this is a good thing. It considered that constitutional entrenchment would protect against parliamentary or executive interference. A range of views were presented in relation to pathways to constitutional entrenchment. The committee considered past, existing and other proposed structures and models for a voice to parliament, including the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee and the National Aboriginal Conference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, Labor has always supported the Uluru Statement from the Heart and its aspiration of greater self-determination. Through the committee, we will continue to work for cross-party support for a voice to parliament, and we will continue to approach with full hearts and open minds the further consultations over the coming months across the nation with both First Nations people and the broader community on how we can realise this aspiration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I finish by saying once again: it is up to this parliament to make those aspirations a reality. We cannot be a roadblock on this journey, because, if we are, it will not only affect First Nations people fundamentally, it will actually diminish us all as a nation.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  Airports are key components of our national economy. Collectively, they employ more than 120,000 people and are critical infrastructure in the movement of people and goods. It's good to see we have the former transport minister at the tableâone of many in this government! Airports are getting busier. More people fly than ever before. New technology and intense competition mean it is much cheaper to fly today than it was more than 30 years ago. Indeed, I personally recall an economy return fare to the UK in 1985, when average weekly wages were around $400, costing my family $2,000. It took a long time to save up to get me to the UK after high school. Sadly, for my family, I came back! Today, with average weekly wages having nearly quadrupled, you can fly to the UK for $1,500. That is $500 less than it was 30 years ago. It is just over a week's wages. Apparently, fares to the UK and the US got down to under $1,000 last year. It is eminently affordable for many Australians, but I must point out that it is still unaffordable for far too many Australians in insecure work and with low wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's little wonder, with fares heading the way they have, that passenger numbers have ballooned both internationally and domestically. This massive increase in passenger numbers has required bigger and better airports, including across our regions. The Airports Amendment Bill 2016 seeks to streamline processes for development at and around 21 federally leased airports. Airports that used to be under Commonwealth control no longer are. The land is owned by the Commonwealth, but they flog the business enterprises off to some very lucky corporations that happen to make a very good amount of money out of those operations. Labor supports this bill, but we will be seeking amendments and we will support an inquiry into the bill when it reaches the other place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tasmania, Hobart and Launceston airports are amongst the 21 that are covered by this legislation. Currently, Hobart and Launceston airports are required to update their master plans every five years. This bill will change that requirement to every eight years, relieving some compliance pressure on airport management. But if we're going to have less frequent updates to airport plans, we need to ensure that the plans airports put in place are better than they are now. In recent years, both Hobart and Launceston airports have had significant upgrades as a result of increased business. These upgrades have driven higher employment and higher profits for the airport companies, and that's good news. But higher profits for airport companies should not come at the expense of the communities that host the airports. Launceston Airport, which sits just inside the northern edge of my electorate, has for the past four years or so failed to pay its fair share to the local community of the Northern Midlands Council. I know the former minister is aware of this because I wrote to him ad nauseam when he was in the ministerial portfolio.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In lieu of rates, airports on federally leased land pay a fee to local councils based on evaluation. As it's federal land, the local council has no legal jurisdiction to levy rates nor to enforce the collection of the fee in lieu. Local councils essentially depend on the airport playing fair and, ultimately, upon the federal transport minister to step in if airports don't pay their way. Following a significant capital upgrade some years ago, Launceston Airport refused to abide by the newest estimates of Tasmania's Valuer-General, which carried with it a significantly higher fee in lieu that recognised the higher valuation as a result of the development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The airport's refusal has led to years of legal stand-offs between the airport corporation, allied with its landlord, the federal department of transport, against the plucky Northern Midlands Council, which is acting on behalf of its ratepayers. The Northern Midlands Council isn't some big fancy council like Sydney or Brisbane; it's a tiny council with a relatively small rates base, lots of sheep farmers, and it needs this money. It hasn't been able to collect more than $1 million in fees because Launceston Airport simply refuses to hand over the money. Every dollar that the airport corporation refuses to pay is a dollar the council does not have to invest in local amenity for Northern Midlands residents and ratepayers. This was a formal process of assessment done by the same people who assess all residential and commercial property in Tasmania. So why should Launceston Airport expect special treatment?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's response through this saga has been disappointing and not helped by the fact there has been a merry-go-round of transport ministers. The current incumbent is the Deputy Prime Minister, and he's getting the same letters that I sent to the minister currently at the table, the member for Gippsland. I do call on the current minister, who is a member of the Nationals, a party that makes much of representing regional communities, to put the interests of a regional council ahead of the interests of a wealthy corporation and direct Launceston Airport to cough up the more than $1 million it now owes the people of the Northern Midlands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll get off Launceston for now. Hobart Airport abuts the southern edge of my electorate. That gives you some indication of the size of my electorate. In the north I've got Launceston and in the south, Hobart sits just outside it. Hobart Airport could also do with some assistance when it comes to dealing with the local community. Hobart has also undergone significant and long-overdue upgrades, and these have been welcomed by all. But it's the new flight paths that have accompanied the upgrades and the extra flights that have my constituents up in arms. More particularly, it was the way that the new flight paths were introduced with no consultation that has people livid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new routes fly over formally quiet towns on the Tasman and Forestier peninsulas, areas that have been developing vineyards and boutique accommodation experiences. The last thing they expected was to see jumbo jets flying overhead, but now they fly overhead along very narrow designated flight paths, increasing the impact significantly for people in towns like Dunalley. The noise has been so loud, so negatively impactful, that the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman initiated an investigation, resulting in a report which included 13 recommendations, all of which made operational suggestions to address poor consultative processes, poor complaint handling and the absence of impact consideration. My office continues to advocate strongly for a better consultation process and, as a result, the Hobart Airport and Airservices Australia have organised a number of more appropriate consultative events, providing the opportunity for the community to interact with the service and raise their concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must stress I do not accept consultation as a tick-and-flick exercise. If Airservices thinks it can mosey into town, have a meeting with the locals then mosey on out and simply continue to do what it wanted to do in the first place, it is badly mistaken. I expect community views to be properly taken into account and acted upon. Where community expectations cannot be met for legal, financial or operational reasons, I expect those reasons to be fully explained and local concerns not simply brushed off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to note that within this bill before the House today is a demand for new Australian noise exposure forecasts in every new airport master plan. I hope there will be limits placed upon permitted noise and noise mitigation policies explored to ensure better community satisfaction. Airports, like other major developments and public infrastructure, have significant implications for the wider community, as I've outlined with Hobart and Launceston. Although they generate income and play a crucial role in transporting goods and people, their operations and construction must be considerate of local amenity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wherever possible, airports should work with, not against, the interests of their host communities. I would like to see, as part of this new master plan process, not just community consultation but also a genuine move towards community partnership, including an ongoing role for local community leaders in airport management, where there are wider impacts to be considered. The master plan process is currently a bit short-sighted and narrowly focused. It requires a strategic approach to the airport every five yearsâsoon to be eight yearsâbut it doesn't require nearly enough attention to be focused on the airport's impacts on the wider community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Airports should be required to assess what their operations are likely to mean for local roads, for example, or for local public transport infrastructure, for nearby creeks and inlets, for shops and for other commercial activities. It is certainly a fact that the road infrastructure in and around both Hobart and Launceston is wanting, to say the least. I don't think there'd be many tourists and visitors coming out of those airports who'd look at the road shoulders coming out of those two airports and think, 'Gee, this is topnotch'âit certainly is not. But those upgrades and management of those things should be a shared responsibility. It's a bit much to expect local councils to carry the cost of these upgrades, and it's certainly a bit much to expect it when the airport corporations are refusing to pay their fair share to those councils.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to access Hobart's airport, you must first navigate a dangerous and busy roundabout on the Tasman Highway, which is a major thoroughfare for people exiting Hobart and heading towards some of the state's growing suburban areas in the south-east of my electorate and along the beautiful east coast and beautiful Tasman Peninsula, also in my electorate. Because of the demands placed upon this section of the road and the ongoing dissatisfaction of road usersâand, I must say, after some pressure from Labor members, on this side of the Houseâthe roundabout is to be replaced with a four-lane overpass intersection. Typical of this government, however, the overpass project is already months behind schedule without even the first sod being turned. And if rumours that I hear are correct, the budget is also being recast without any work already having been doneânot a very good indication of the way that project is going under the joint management of the federal Liberal government and the state Liberal government. Importantly, when that interchange finally happens, it will improve access to the airport and it will be better able to handle the growth in visitor numbers, air freight transport and any commercial developments in the area. Anticipating the demands that will be placed on the surrounds of airports is critical in ensuring that they are equipped to manage and mitigate future growth and increased demands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Far, far from my electorate is Sydney. Sydney airport is the world's 20th-busiest airport. In 2017 it saw 43.3 million passengers go through itâin one year. Just the year before, Sydney was the world's 23rd-busiest airport, so it's jumped three spaces globally in one year. That is a phenomenal increase. The growth is not incidental and it is demonstrative of Australia's increased visitor numbers, thanks to our country's global reputation as a tourist destination, with high domestic and overseas tourist numbers. While it is positive to see such growth, there are challenges, including environmental wear and tear and the fact that public infrastructure and transport systems struggle to cope with higher demands. It's little wonder that with that growth and, given the size of Sydney, we are now looking at a second Sydney airport. It makes sense, but so does the implementation of a range of new requirements for airport infrastructure, including better environmental assessments, better management and oversight processes and certainly better community consultation and community partnership. I know from speaking to my colleagues on this side of the House who represent some of the communities out in Western Sydney that they are very critical of the fact that their communities have been effectively sidelined with the planning for Badgerys Creek and the way it's essentially being imposed upon them. I'm not sure whether it will be a 24-hour flight plan, but there will certainly be very late flights and very early flightsâthings that residents in Sydney are not subjected to. So we support this, but we will be seeking amendments.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:25</span>):  The Airports Amendment Bill 2016 amends the Airports Act to streamline the process for development at and around federally leased airports. While Labor mostly welcomes this bill, we are proposing two amendments: firstly, that the monetary trigger threshold for major development plans be reduced to $25 million and, secondly, that the automatic approval of requests for shorter public consultation periods in relation to major development plans around airports be removed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports investment in aviation, and we're committed to growing this crucial sector in our economy. Airports are economic powerhouses. I know this because I represent the electorate that has Australia's largest and busiest airport. I'm very proud to represent the electorate of Kingsford Smith, which bears the name of Australia's most famous aviator, Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, the legendary Smithy, who lost his life at the all-too-young age of 38 in 1935. My electorate also hosts Australia's largest and busiest airport, which bears Kingsford Smith's name. Last year, Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport was used by 43.3 million passengers. That's an increase of over five million passengers each year from 2013. As the previous speaker mentioned, Kingsford Smith airport is now the 20th busiest airport in the world. Today, more than 40 per cent of overseas travellers visiting Australia pass through Kingsford Smith airport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The airport, like many others across Australia, is seeing an increasing number of visitors, in particular, from Asia. In particular, it's Asia's rising middle class who are now making the most of new opportunities to travel, and for many that choice of travel is to our great southern land. It's a big-picture trend that's likely to continue, with 88 per cent of the world's next billion entrants into the middle class coming from Asia. That's 380 million people from India's middle class, 350 million from China's middle class and 210 million in the rest of Asia. We know that when people move out of poverty and into higher income brackets, into the middle class, they gain an appetite for services, particularly healthcare services, education services and, importantly, tourism and travel services. For many in Asia, Australia is now a very popular destination because it's in their backyard, it's within the same time zone and it's easily accessible by air. So it's clear that our airports are vital to Australia's economy in helping to boost tourism and trade as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Later this month, Sydney Airport will release its latest 20-year draft blueprint for the future of Kingsford Smith airport. The airport says it's forecasting passenger numbers to reach 65 million in 2039. Yet Sydney Airport says the No. 1 community concern facing Kingsford Smith now and over the next two decades is the crippling road congestion and poor public transport links to the airport. There are very few other international airports that I know of where, if you leave the international airport, you are straight onto a domestic and suburban street, but that is exactly the case at Sydney's international airport and domestic airport, particularly when you leave the domestic terminal. You're straight onto Robey Street in Mascot. People live in Robey Street. It's their life. Their houses are there. Their garages are there. They park there. Yet we're dumping all of this traffic onto local streets from the busiest airport in the country, without any real public transport links and without any consideration for those that live around the airport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The suburban streets around the airport are now clogged with traffic on a daily basis. If you go to Sydney airport any time after 5 am, you are almost guaranteed to get into a traffic jam. Once again, we've seen that the New South Wales Liberal government has failed the public when it comes to key infrastructure and planning and when it comes to spending around taking some of the pressure off our communityâthe community that I representâin respect of the airport. I'm getting a number of letters and emails from constituents who are telling me that people who are going overseas or going on a flight will simply park in their street and leave their car there for weeks or, in some cases, months and walk with their bags to the airport, and they can do this because the airport is only down the road. For some areas, it's less than a 500-metre walk to the terminal from some of the suburban streets that people are now parking in. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned earlier, Kingsford Smith is, of course, Australia's busiest airport. Yet, when you talk about busy airports throughout the world, the one thing that they all tend to have is very good public transport links. That's certainly not the case with Kingsford Smith Airport in Mascot because, believe it or not, there is only one bus route that services Sydney airport. The 400 service bus that comes from Bondi Junction and Burwood remains the only bus service that gets in and out of Kingsford Smith Airport. For years now, the operators of the airport, Sydney Airport Corporation Limited, have been crying out to the New South Wales Liberal government saying, 'We need additional bus services if we're going to get more people in and out of the airport on public transport rather than using cars.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Four years ago, the New South Wales Liberal government unveiled their so-called long-term plans to improve bus access at Kingsford Smith Airport. And what have they done about it since then? Zero, zilch, not a thing. It's clear that Premier Gladys Berejiklian has been asleep at the wheel yet again on infrastructure policy and planning when it comes to the future growth of Kingsford Smith Airport, and often it's the airport workers that are left in the lurch as a result. There are 30,900 people who work at Kingsford Smith Airport. As I said earlier, airports are economic powerhouses, and they provide a lot of jobs for people in the surrounding community. Forty-four per cent of those who work at the airport live in the St George-Sutherland area, represented quite ably by the shadow minister that's sitting with me here at the table, the member for Barton. Yet, there are no direct public transport links from that area to the airport. Where most of the people that work at the airport live, there is no direct public transport link for them to be able to get on public transport to actually get to work. That is an absolute disgrace. For a large metropolitan capital like Sydney, with the busiest airport in the country, to not have a public transport link to where most of the people work to access the airport is beyond a joke.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to rail services, it doesn't get any better, unfortunately. Around 24 per cent of passengers and people working at Kingsford Smith catch trains to and from the airport, and that's up from 13 per cent a decade ago. Yet most airports around Europe and Asia have between 40 and 60 per cent of passengers travelling to and from them by train. Why does Sydney airport have such low numbers of both passengers and workers accessing the airport by train compared to global benchmarks? One good reason is that workers and passengers are slugged a one-way fee of $18.10 to travel to the airport during peak hours. To travel what is really a five-minute trip on the train from areas like Hurstville or the City of Sydney to the airport will cost you $18.10 during peak hour, and that's a single trip fare. And $13.80 of the fare is the station access fee that's paid to the New South Wales government. Is it any wonder that the non-existent bus services and the rip-off that is associated with the train fare into Sydney airport has forced all of that congestion onto local roads? The community and the people who I represent are bearing that congestion and are fed up with it. They want the New South Wales Liberal government and, indeed, the Turnbull government to do something about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The New South Wales Liberal government say that they are improving the road network via the wonderful WestConnex. Isn't that going to be just sensational for the community that I represent? Here, you've got WestConnexâbelieve it or not, it is the largest road project in Sydneyâgoing straight past the second busiest container port in the country, at Port Botany, and straight past Sydney international airport with no connection at all to those two vitally important pieces of infrastructure. For anyone who is travelling from the west and wants to access Sydney airport, guess what? They will get off at the St Peters-Tempe interchange, which is about four or five kilometres away from the actual airport. How do you think they are going to get to the airport, if they're travelling there? I tell you what they're going to do: they're going to come down the suburban streets that I mentioned earlierâparticularly Gardeners Road and Botany Road, which are already clogged with traffic as it isâand they are going to dump an additional hundreds of thousands of cars per month on those suburban streets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point to make is, because there is no access to the second biggest container port in the country, many of those vehicles that will be travelling down those roads will be the big B-doubles that carry freight in and out of the port. Not only are you going to have passengers from Sydney airport competing to go down these roads but you are also going to get these big freight trucks that take freight to and from the port coming down Botany Road, Gardeners Road and Robey Streetâthe streets that I mentioned earlierâputting additional congestion on our roads. It is any wonder that, with the non-existent bus services and the rip-off to get a train, workers are forced onto these congested roads? Every day around 160,000 people are going to and from the airport and yet the New South Wales Liberal government have no plan on how to solve the current congestion crisis, let alone a plan for future growth and the numbers that are coming over the coming decades.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aircraft noise is always an issue around airports. I probably have more complaints than most MPs, given the busy nature of Sydney airport. I have written to the respective transport ministers. I know that there is a long-term operating plan for Sydney airport and that the majority of flights are meant to go out over the sea rather than over homes; but regularly, when we check on the Airservices Australia website, they are not meeting the targets that are set down under the long-term operating plan. We get complaints from constituents, understandably, for the increasing noise that we're seeing around the airport. With the advent of modern aircraft, flights have become more efficient, more powerful and quieter. We should be able to send more of those flights out over the water rather than over people's households.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen a massive increase in the traffic from helicopters over Sydney airport as well. There were 5,776 helicopter trips in 2010 to and from Sydney airport. That has now risen to 15,730 in 2017, which is about a 173 per cent increase in helicopter trips over the last seven years. Most of them are coming from the airport straight out over Mascot, Pagewood and Maroubra. Once they get out to the sea, they do a left-hand turn, go straight up the coast, do a joy ride around the harbour and then come back and do the same trip. By the time that they are getting back to Sydney airport, they're flying very low when they're coming in over households. We've had a lot of complaints from constituents about this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our airports are pieces of critical national infrastructure. They deserve better. Our airports don't operate in isolation. They are part of our community. They can have significant impacts on people and places. That's why the development of our airports needs to be well planned and done in consultation with communities. That is the key: ensuring that there is consultation with communities. Labor supports investment in aviation infrastructure. As I said earlier, airports are economic powerhouses, but it needs to be done in consultation with communities. That's why we're proposing that the trigger for development plans be dropped from $35 million to $25 million and that this proposal to ensure that the time line can be reduced for consultation with communities be rejected. Consultation with communities is the key to ensuring that we have viable, workable airports that provide jobs for people and also important travel and tourism services.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  It's safe to say that the issue of airports is a hot one for my electorate in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, so I look at the Airports Amendment Bill 2016 in the context that it probably does little to reassure communities I represent, particularly in the Blue Mountains and those who value their night-time silence in the Hawkesbury. But I also look at it from the perspective of other airports I know quite well, including Hobart, Alice Springs and Darwin, which are keen to see appropriate commercial development around their sites. I will speak of Western Sydney Airport later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of meeting the needs of other airports, I want to talk about the additional measures Labor has indicated that we are moving with this bill. One is the monetary trigger. It's pretty reasonable to see $25 million, rather than the $35 million that the government proposed, as a trigger for a separate major development plan. It reflects CPI but also maintains the commitment that we have to have to people who live alongside an existing airport. They need to be assured that their scrutiny won't be reduced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other amendmentâwhich the government has seen the merit of and, I understand, will supportâis around proper consultation. At the moment, with draft major development plans, the public consultation period is 60 business days. The minister, though, can approve a shorter period of not less than 15 business days if asked in writing by the operator to do so, as long as they are satisfied that the proposed development is consistent with the approved airport master plan and that it doesn't have significant impact on the local or regional community. The government has proposed that, if the minister doesn't make a decision on the request within 15 business days, the minister be deemed to have approved that shorter period. We can't support that. It has the potential to take away the rights of local communities to have their say. I think a minister should be able to consider a request for reduced consultation within 15 business daysâthat's three weeks. But where that doesn't happen, rather than the request being deemed approved, it should be deemed not approved. A lack of decision should go not in favour of the airport operators but in favour of the community's right to scrutiny. Certainly Labor has increased the rights for communities when we've been in office. It was Labor that required federal airports to establish community aviation consultation groups. Before then, they just didn't exist. Whilst some airports do it better than others, it's right that they're all required to have a robust consultation process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to the fact that, in spite of having a set of rules for existing airports, none of this will really help the residents of the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury who are concerned right now about Badgerys Creek Airport. One of the key issues is flight noise. The legislation talks about noise, and the ANEF is the official Australian measure of flight noise. More importantly, the ANEF standards suggest that, outside the ANEF 20, housing construction doesn't need to be modified due to aircraft noise. But I want to put on the record concerns about the ANEF. A former Aircraft Noise Ombudsman, Ron Brent, appointed by the Australian government in 2010 to help improve the handling of complaints around aircraft noise, to improve the information about aircraft noise and to improve the consultation about changes in air traffic that alter the impact of aircraft noise, is considered something of an expert. I've turned to his work, as I struggle to convey to people who live outside the Blue Mountains the genuine fear about the impacts of 24-hour aircraft noise, which will ultimately be the result of building an airport at the foot of the Blue Mountains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Mr Brent points out, the first thing to note about aircraft noise is that the experience of itâor any noise for that matterâis highly subjective. Unbearable noise for one person might not be of concern to another. He points to research in the US that has shown that, even in areas below the ANEF 20 noise rating, up to 45 per cent of residents are likely to be moderately or severely affected by aircraft noise. The other really important thing about noise from planes is that it's different to the noise created by railways or roads. It will reach a much wider area. It can't be shielded by barriers along the route, and it's not restricted to a narrow and predictable path. It doesn't fall in a straight line but spreads over an area that gets wider as the aircraft gets higher. It also gets quieter as the aircraft climbs. This means that the noise can reach more people once the aircraft is further from the airport, yet it can be many kilometres from take-off before the noise stops being intrusive for most people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are living that experience in the Blue Mountains right now with A380s and the newer aircraft. There's been a marked increase in the annoyance factor from planes travelling from east to west across the mountains. At the same time, people say, 'Oh, the new planes are so much quieter!' Well, they might be quieter on the ground, but the heavier planes take longer to get to their cruising height and so are now flying over the mountains at not 20,000-plus feet but as low as 13,000 feet, and they are much noisier. Many people tell me that they don't bother with an alarm clock, because the first flights out of Sydney airport in the morning head across at about 6.20 am and serve as a wake-up call. The same can be said of the last flights, crossing the mountains usually before 10.30 pmâand of course they are at those times because Sydney airport has a curfew.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back to ANEF: the ANEF comes from a complex formula, including how loud the noise is, how frequent it is, and the distribution of the noise across the day and the night, because aircraft at night make more noise than in the day, when there are fewer competing noises. Mr Brent explains that the final average level won't tell you whether you'll get occasional loud noises, frequent quieter noise, lots of high noise or most of the noise between six and seven in the morning, when you hope to sleep in. What's more, the ANEF level will not tell you how bad things will be on the worst days. So, it's important to ensure that when evaluation is done on the Western Sydney airport's proposed flight paths it's not based on ANEF alone. N70 contours, which outline areas within which there'll be a given number of times a day that will get noise loud enough to disrupt a reasonable conversationâsomething that will drown out conversation around the barbecue, which is around 70 decibelsâmust be included, as well as maximum and minimum daily forecasts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course we're not going to see these things for the Blue Mountains or the Hawkesbury for years. There is an airport under construction, yet there are no flight paths. The community is not going to be given this information about a 24-hour airport. Heathrow Airport has certainly realised that as flight volumes grow and more communities are more profoundly affected they need to do more. Their Fly Quiet and Green program focuses not just on noise but also on emissions, which would seem to be a sensible thing to be targeting. My point is that there is much more to be done by this government in the context of its plans for a huge new airport in Western Sydney. This bill is based on the idea that there must be a social compact between airports and the communities that live around them. Unless this government is transparent about the true impacts the airport will have on the Blue Mountains, there will never be a social compact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's start with community engagementâthe forum on Western Sydney airport drop-ins. This was multiple boards of information put around the room on a Friday night so that people could come and see itâlots of pretty pictures but, I have to say, I could find only one mention of the fact that the airport is a 24/7 airport with no curfew. It might suit the government for hundreds of thousands of people to not know that the planes will fly all through the night, but it is not an honest way of moving forward. In fact, I know that not everyone in this chamber has really got the message that this is a 24-hour airport in one of the most densely populated parts of our country. It is a blatant lack of transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to quote from D Southgate from Airport Operations in the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Services, writing in the year 2000â18 years agoâabout aircraft noise, which should serve as a warning to this government. He said: 'There is little doubt that if the public believes it has been misled on noise predictions then there's going to be a negative reaction which far exceeds that which would otherwise be expected from a particular level of noise exposure.' I think that warning holds true, if we don't see honesty and transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nor has there been any attempt to really address publicly why there is no curfewâwhy it's okay for the people in the west of Sydney to have planes flying above them as low as a few thousand feet, even across the Blue Mountains, when it would be completely unacceptable in the east of the city. For goodness sake! The Prime Minister got upset with his local council for considering a skate park operating in daylight hours because the noise would disturb local residents. Yet he has not a qualm about subjecting the ever-growing Western Sydney population to sleep-disturbing noises through the night.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the 24-hour nature of this airport, nor can I accept that the project is barrelling on ahead without the release of flight paths. We're told that the ones in the IES were not the real ones. Really? Can anyone tell me that 100 per cent of incoming flights to this airport won't go across the Blue Mountains at any hour of the day? No-one is able to give that guarantee. Even with the promised night-time no-fly zone, where is the data to show how many nights of the year it will be able to be implemented? The reality is that, given a single runway, there are only two ways that a plane can fly in and take offâand, given prevailing winds, probably only one way most of the time. I was concerned to hear the previous speaker talk about how many times the long-term operating plan at Sydney Airport is not kept in the way it's meant to be. Is that the sort of thing we can expect to see in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury? These are all questions that people deserve the answers to, so be honest, get real and tell people so they can make their own judgement about whether the price they pay is an acceptable one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People also expect transparency around the jobs figures that are being touted. A research report for the Jobs for Western Sydney working group written by Dr Ian Watson, who specialises in labour market research, has found that, contrary to the claims of a jobs bonanza, only 120 construction jobs and 800 airport jobs would be targeted to Western Sydney workers in the first stages of the project. That is a lot lower than the expectations people in the community have about how readily they're going to be able to get work, and it's been confirmed to me that anyone who takes a job on the airport project and relocates to the region for the duration of that work will be considered a local. So you don't have to have been born in that area or gone to school in that area or live in that area now with your family. You just have to be able to move into the area, and they can tick a box and say, 'Oh, there's another local.' So there isn't even any guarantee that the local jobs will go to an existing local employment pool. Dr Watson's report, to be released in the next week, finds the overall job claims, such as 8,700 aviation jobs by 2031, are vastly exaggerated, and his analysis is that the proposals for the adjacent business park and for the aerotropolis appear unrealistic. I congratulate the group on the serious work they've done to work through the numbers and what they're trying to do to get behind the spin, to get to the bottom and to paint a realistic picture, because that's what people deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing in what I have learnt of this airport plan since it was first talked about, nothing I have seen in the data and nothing I have seen in researching projects around the world has given me very much peace of mind. Nothing I've seen or been told changes my view that there are profound negative impacts from the flight paths across the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury. As a community, I believe, we will have to fight hard to protect the peace and silence that we have until now been able to take for granted as something that we have when we choose to live in a World Heritage area. But you can't only stand here and fight for the things you know you are going to win, so I'm here to fight for what I believe is right for the community that I'm privileged to represent. The community is concerned not just for itself but also to ensure that future generations have the same privilege of being able to live and play peacefully in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury.</span>

                    <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  I speak in respect of the Airports Amendment Bill 2016, and I note that this bill has been before the parliament since December 2016, almost two years. Perhaps it will get through today. I make that point because it was only earlier this year that a master plan for the airport within my electorate, Parafield Airport, was finally approved. I suspect, had this legislation been in place in 2016, there might have been some differences with respect to the treatment of that master plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 21 federally leased airports around Australia, of which 19 require a master plan to be prepared every five years. This legislation makes several changes to the Airports Act, and I will go through them very briefly. Firstly, it increases the processing time for master plans from five years to eight years, so there will be an eight-year cycle instead of a five-year cycle. Secondly, updated noise exposure forecasts will be required with each new master plan application. Thirdly, there will be a lifting of the monetary figure from $20 million to $35 million and the introduction of a three-yearly construction indexation for the requirement of a separate major development plan. Fourthly, it will establish a decision time frame of 15 days for the minister to consider reduced periods for major development plan approvals. Fifthly, it will enable the minister to extend more than once the period during which developments are required to be substantially completed. And, lastly, it will allow airport operators to notify the minister if exceptional circumstances mean that a major development cannot proceed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak in support of the comments already made by the member for Grayndler in respect of this legislation. And I understand that there'll be some amendments moved, perhaps in the committee stage of the bill, particularly with respect to the $35 million matter and the 15-day approval proposal that I referred to earlier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is very relevant to the people that I represent, because, within the Makin electorate, lies Parafield Airport. It is a general aviation airport established in 1927. Until 1960 it was located in what was considered to be outside the metropolitan area of Adelaide and surrounded largely by open farmland. Today that is no longer the case. Urban Adelaide now surrounds Parafield Airport, with homes and industry right around it. In 1998, the airport was leased to Adelaide Airport Limited for 99 years. It was effectively privatised, with the only control reserved by the federal government being the approval process of the five-yearly master plans, a process that appears to be little more than a box-ticking exercise, which I expect comes at great expense and time to airport management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Airports are exempt from all state and local government laws, as are all Commonwealth properties, and therefore there is little input that state and local government authorities and residents can make with respect to the plans. Yes, the plans are put on display, and, yes, there is a consultation period that the operators have to go through, but ultimately the airport can still determine what it wants to do on its land without having to be accountable to the local community. The master plan process is therefore really a mechanismâand it's the only mechanismâavailable to the federal government to limit any airport development, because, as I made clear a moment ago, airport developments are not limited by local authorities. In fact, when we see what is happening at airports today, they are not only used for aviation activities, to which the exemptions originally were meant to apply, but are now also used for wide-scale, non-aviation commercial developments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In January this year, the former Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the member for New England, approved the 2017 Parafield Airport Master Plan. In his letter of approval, the minister stated, 'In making my decision, I considered the views of the South Australian government as well as all relevant federal agencies and other interested parties.' Many residents were aggrieved by that decision. Indeed, many residents contacted my office with respect to it. They felt their views had been ignored, that their concerns were not heard, and that, in reality, they had no say. I sympathise with those residents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parafield Airport management went through the public consultation process required of them. It culminated with a public forum held in Salisbury, attended by senior airport representatives and around 100 local residents. At the forum, airport representatives provided detailed representations of the master plan and how it was to be developed. Regrettably, insufficient time was provided to allow all of those people present to raise their personal concerns, ask questions or make verbal submissions. Several people that spoke to me when the forum had ended expressed their disappointment about not having been given an opportunity to speak in the public forumâalbeit that, in fairness to them, the airport management staff offered to stay back and speak to people privately about the matters of concern to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The dominant issue of concern that was raised was the incessant noise generated by circuit training around the airport, particularly by trainee pilots, most of whom are being trained by an international training college based at Parafield Airport. It is in the middle of suburbia, and flight-training activities which were once not a problem are today, for many, incompatible with residential living. It is particularly a problem for those homes that are directly under the flight-training air paths. Flight training is, however, important for the aviation industry and I accept that. It's not only an important economic driver for South Australia, with most of the student pilots coming from overseas, but it's important that we have sufficiently well-trained pilots to work within the air industry. I accept that it remains a fact that the airport has been at Parafield since 1927, prior to residents moving in, and that flight training has always been a core business of the airport. I understand that, at present, there are about 215,000 aircraft movements at the airport per year, and that most of them are attributed to the flight-training activities. There have also been commendable efforts by airport management, through its technical advisory committee, to reduce noise impacts on surrounding residential areas. However, I believe that more can be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, the airport's Fly Friendly Program could be improved. Daily commencement and end times of flight training, particularly on weekends and public holidays, could be made much more family-friendly. Several other suggestions that would reduce noise impact have also been made over the years, but it always seems that there is an unconvincing reason as to why those suggestions cannot be adopted. More recently, I note that the state member for Playford, the Hon. Michael Brown, has proposed that the aircraft used for circuit training should be replaced with electric aircraft. I understand that electric aircraft are currently being trialled at Jandakot in WA with services to Rottnest Island. My understanding is that they can stay in the air for about an hour, perhaps with a reserve of another 30 minutes after that, so that may well be the way to go. I don't know if they will make a difference to noise, because I'm not an aircraft engineer. But if they do improve the situation, then that is, perhaps, another matter that could be considered into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the core of the residents' concern is that they felt that their voices were simply not being heard, and that the changes they were proposing with respect to the master plan were not in any way adopted within the plan. And, to my knowledge, I'm not aware of any notable changes having been made to the master plan as a result of the consultation processâwhich highlights the point I made earlier: is it really a consultation process? Or is it really an information process, for the surrounding public to be made aware of what the airport management propose into the future?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other matter that I will speak about is the issue of the noise exposure forecasts. I note that, under this bill, the noise exposure forecasts must be lodged with every master plan update. What effect that will have on the approval process is, in my mind, unclear. Again, will they simply provide more information or do they change the nature of the master plan that is to be approved? Bear in mind that, if no change is made to the master plan, the existing plan continues in operation: the fact that a master plan is not approved does not restrict the airport owners from continuing with development on airports; it simply restricts them from making developments inconsistent with the currently approved master plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another matter has more recently emerged in respect of this issue, which is also very relevant to the question of master plans. I understand that the government is currently consulting with respect to what are referred to as public safety zones. In short these safety zones are intended to ensure that areas at the end of each runway at airports around the country might have restrictions placed on them with respect to the types of buildings that might go onto that land. I also understand that, where a development has already occurred, that will not be affected. If developments are already in place, those developments will be able to continue regardless of what changes are made in respect of public safety zones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly this proposal will create a limit on the types of developments that can be constructed at the end of the runways. I'm referring to land at the end of the runways outside of the airport itselfâin other words, privately-owned land that lines up with the airport runways. That will clearly have an impact on the value of that land. People in the northern suburbs of Adelaide have already expressed concerns with respect to the impact the public safety zone proposal will have on their land. In particular, a lot of the land in the northern areas of Adelaide lies between Parafield Airport and Edinburgh air base, so it's actually trapped between two airports. That in turn means considerable tracts of land may be subject to whatever recommendations arise out of this proposal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand its purpose. In the past my understanding was that any developments were restricted only on the basis of the noise exposure forecast grids created around the airports. This adds a new dimension to the restrictions, which was not foreseen at the time local governments put in their own citywide development plans, when many people made investments and planned for their future in the knowledge that the noise exposure forecast grid determined what could be built on their privately-owned land around the airports. I accept that the broader community is currently being consulted on this matter and no final position has been reached, but it is clear to me that if public safety zones are to be included in future developments around airports then the public safety zones would have a direct impact on the master plan process and the master plans currently applying to each and every one of those 19 airports. How will the public safety zones be incorporated into the master plan process in the future, and what impact will public safety zones have on them?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will listen with interest to the debate in respect of the amendments. I believe that the amendments proposed to be moved by the member for Grayndler are very sensible, as other members on this side of the House have made clear, and I once again endorse the comments made by the member for Grayndler when on behalf of the opposition he responded to this legislation.</span>

The federal government regulates planning and development on federally-leased airport sites through the Airports Act 1996. On 1 December 2016 the former minister, the member for Gippsland, introduced the bill into the House of Representatives. The bill proposes several measures developed in consultation with key industry stakeholders to streamline certain administrative arrangements in the Airports Act 1996 relating to master plans and major development plans that are currently generating inefficient outcomes for industry as well as imposing unnecessary and onerous administrative and compliance costs. In particular, the bill proposes to implement a differential master plan submission cycle, thereby requiring the major airports, such as Brisbane, Melbourne, Tullamarine, Perth, Sydney's Kingsford Smithâand I note the comments from the member for Kingsford Smith in this debateâand Western Sydney airport to maintain the current five-year submission cycle while the remaining airports will prepare a master plan every eight years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also proposes to increase the current $20 million monetary trigger for a major development plan to $25 million. The monetary threshold will be reviewed and revised via legislative instrument every three years, having regard to changes in construction activity costs and associated indexations to ensure that the monetary trigger accurately reflects and keeps pace with economic and marketplace conditions. The bill reinforces the government's commitment to improving the capacity of our regulatory framework to ensure that it continues to deliver a proportionate and efficiency-based approach that reduces administrative and compliance costs for operators, creating regulatory certainty for industry and maintaining appropriate and effective regulatory oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 9 February 2017 the bill was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 28 March that year. Following an aviation accident at Essendon Airport, the Senate granted an extension of time for reporting, to 19 March 2018. In March 2018 the committee recommended that the Senate pass the Airports Amendment Bill 2017. The committee's report has made it very clear that there is no linkage between the accident at Essendon Airport and the matters under consideration in this bill. I thank the shadow minister for infrastructure and transport for working constructively in a bipartisan way to ensure passage of this legislation, and I acknowledge his amendments to the bill, which he's just about to put to the House. The government contends that the bill will bring about positive changes for the aviation industry and airport users whilst still maintaining appropriate regulatory oversight and that this bill should be supported. With that, I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the minister for the constructive way in which we've engaged on this legislation to make sure that what is, I think, a good piece of legislation is made better by dialogue. These questions shouldn't be partisan; they should be the subject of proper scrutinyâhence these amendments that I'm moving today, which the government will accept, I think will improve the bill before it goes to the Senate and should ensure that passage is expedited in the other place with the support of all of the adults in the room.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (1) changes the lower-threshold amount in schedule 1, substituting $25 million for $35 million. The rationale for this is quite clear: a major development plan must be completed in a number of circumstances, including when a monetary trigger is reached. The current monetary trigger of $20 million was determined in 2007. The bill originally proposed to increase this threshold by 75 per cent, to $35 million. In my view, that's excessive and it's also problematic. While the government has argued that this increase reflects changes to construction industry costs, and other economic conditions that have occurred, I believe that a 75 per cent increase doesn't accurately reflect the changes in construction costs since 2007. According to the ABS construction CPI, costs have increased by 20 per cent. A number of major and sizeable airport construction projects would fall under a $35 million threshold, and such projects would be exempt from public consultations and other assessments. A $25 million monetary trigger is far more appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say to the minister that one of the first things I did upon coming to the high office that he now holds, of transport minister responsible for aviation, was go to an opening of a number of projects at Melbourne Airport. I asked what the process was for the MDP. What had occurred was they'd broken up what was a very large expansion into a series of smaller projects in order to not have an MDP. The truth is that we, as public office holders, have a responsibility to ensure that there's public scrutiny available. That's what the government's acceptance of this amendment will do. I thank him for the spirit in which it's put forward. It is to ensure that there's no diminution of accountability as a result of the expansions, of which there are a number of very considerable expansions to aviation around this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I see, and I know the minister sees when he sees those expansions, is jobs and economic activity. It's a good thing, but it needs to have that scrutiny to make sure that whilst we maximise the economic benefit of aviation we also minimise the impact on the community, because from time to time infrastructure projects do have a negative impact on the community and that's why it's important that they be able to be consulted.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second amendment is to change the issue of shorter consultation periods. It is:</span>

I know that the minister will take his duties very seriously and examine each of these plans. With a range of plans, particularly for the secondary airports, I found they can have a real impact, becauseâwhether it be the Parafields, the Jandakots or the Bankstownsâthey tend to be located around a lot of residences. I certainly took my responsibility seriously and on a range of occasions basically sent it back effectively with a mark of 'needs to do better before it's approved'. And guess what? They did do better. That provides a confidence there for the public.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently the public consultation period associated with draft MDPs, as specified in subsection 92(2A) of the act, is 60 business days. The minister can approve a shorter period, not less than 15 days, if asked in writing by the airport operator to do so, and as long as they are satisfied that the proposed development is consistent with the airport master plan and does not raise any issues that have a significant impact on the local or regional community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to insert new subsection 92(2BA), which would provide that if the airport makes a request for a shorter consultation period and the minister does not make a decision on the request within 15 business days then the minister is deemed to have approved that shorter period. Labor can't support that amendment, and I'm pleased that the minister's been very much open to having some dialogue about this. This is one of the pieces of legislation in this parliament which won't change a vote either way. Most legislation is like that. We should be able to consult, have dialogue and come out with better outcomes in the national interest. In the words of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span> that was prepared by the Parliamentary Library: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This amendment seems to raise the possibility that the Minister could simply not decide on the request, and then be deemed to have approved the short period, even if the development is inconsistent with the airport master plan, or raises issues that have a significant impact on the local or regional community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be within a minister's capability to consider a request for reduced consultation within 15 days. In circumstances where this doesn't occur, it's appropriate for it to be deemed that the request is not approved, is refused. That achieves a better balance. The whole philosophy behind the aviation green paper and white paper process was to ensure that you had proper planning around airports. In some of the debate that's taken place about flight paths, for example, with Western Sydney airport, I note that of course there aren't flight paths yet, because they're done every five years under an airport master plan. There is a constant review. There is a constant need now, and indeed a legislated requirement, to have community consultation and engagement. Interestingly, at the time that that was done, a lot of the airports weren't exactly fans of this reform. They all acknowledge now that, as a result of this reform, their processes have been substantially improved and the relationships with the communities around their airport have been enhanced. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  During the term of this government, we've seen its complete lack of compassion, lack of thought and lack of attention to vulnerable Australians doing it tough. Rather, we've seen those opposite instead looking after their mates at the top end of town with the budget, as we know, for big businessâa tax handout of $80 billion to the big multinationals and the big banks. But what we have here today is something on a new level, even for those opposite. Not only does the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing Trial) Bill 2018 neglect vulnerable Australians doing it tough, but it goes on the attack to degrade and demonise those people, who instead should be receiving our support. This bill, instead of helping them, will only hurt them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of zero evidence, what we see before us is this government's second attempt to establish a two-year trial of drug testing for 5,000 recipients of Newstart allowance and youth allowance in three trial locations, including Logan in Queensland, which is in the electorate of my friend and colleague the member for Rankin, just next to my own. Don't be fooled. If the government gets its way, this will only be the beginning. This is despite the government being unable to provide any evidence supporting the establishment of their drug testing trial or revealing the cost. We're talking not just about the cost to the budget but also about the cost to individual Australians, the cost to families and the cost to communities who will bear the brunt of this reckless policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government previously tried to introduce this measure as part of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017. That bill was subject to a Senate inquiry which reported on 6 September last year. The report of this inquiry stated that a number of serious areas of concern 'were raised in submissions and oral evidence in relation to the proposed establishment of drug testing trials', including:</span>

                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">a lack of evidence to support the use of drug testing;</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This feedback should ring alarm bells that this legislation is poorly thought out and poorly designed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor opposed many of the measures in the welfare reform bill, including the drug testing trials, the first time around, and we are doing so again this time. Many concerns have been raised about this measure by health and welfare groups, including St Vincents Health, the Royal Australian College of Physicians, ACOSS and UnitingCare, just to name a few. Not one health or community organisation has come out publicly in support of the trial. Let me say that again: not one health or community organisation has come out publicly in support of the trialânot a single one. There is not a single strand of evidence to support this vindictive policy and not a single health or community backed organisation that supports it. This government is on its own on this one, and clearly it must think it knows more than the experts do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, medical professionals and the drug and alcohol treatment sector have raised significant concerns not only about the impact these measures will have on jobseekers but also that they won't be effective in identifying those with a serious problem or providing them with treatment. Experts warn that these changes will not help people to overcome addiction, because that is not how addiction works. Instead, they will be pushed into crisis, poverty, homelessness and potentially crime. Let me repeat that: they will be pushed into crisis, poverty, homelessness and potentially crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nonetheless, the government persist. Even in the face of this overwhelming evidence that people will not be better off, they persist with this poorly thought-out policy. The director of the St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne Department of Addiction Medicine had this to say on the measures proposed by the government:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There will be more crime, more family violence, more distress within society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's right: there will be more crime, more family violence and more distress within society. She continues:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We can expect at Centrelink offices there will be aggression and violence as people react to this. Had [the government] spoken to the various bodies who work in this areaâ</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was very moving to see the recognition of the 341 Australian soldiers of Jewish faith who have died while on service in the Australian Defence Force, from 1900 to today. Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove spoke movingly of the role of the Jewish members of the Defence Force and the sacrifice that they made alongside their brothers and sisters of other faiths in defence of our great country. Sir John Monash is the best-known Jewish Australian soldier, and Australia's outstanding military leader. He was no doubt an inspiration to many of the Jewish members of the Defence Force that were remembered. On the centenary of Monash's knighthood, it was timely to recognise the thousands of Jews who, though less well known, have given the same service, risking their lives for their country. </span>

Doors aren't so easy to open, furniture does seem to get in the way and taps are hard to operate. I can better understand and respect what life in a wheelchair is like, and the challenges that people face every day at home, at school and at work.

With 105,000 older Australians still on the waiting listâand this is old data, from back in December last yearâfamilies are approaching those of us on this side of the House with so many stories now about their inability to access packages to keep their loved ones living at home for longer.</span>

The government is releasing just 4,000 places per year over the next four years, when there are 105,000 Australians in need. We need the new data released. I know the minister was holding off until the by-elections took place. The by-elections are out of the way. Give us the new dataâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  On Saturday, 11 August, I attended celebrations to unveil a 150-year plaque for the Creed family at The Old Station, Raglan. It was also a celebration of the Australian Century Farm and Station Award. It was first settled in 1868. The Creed family were pioneers of the Raglan district and have been longstanding members of the wider community. The same family being there for over 150 years continuously is a major milestone for the area. Considering the impacts of severe droughts and harsh seasonal and economic conditions for rural families over this period of time, it is nothing short of amazing. The Old Station is located in a scenic valley to the north-west of Gladstone. In recent years, the family have found a new income stream. It's now a destination for tourists and guests to visit and stay and experience life on a grazing property. Congratulations to the family, and I thank them for their community contributions. The event on Saturday was very well organised and well attended.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  I rise with great concern about the news that's been emerging today about proposals to support or, indeed, launch new coal-fired power stations at the expense of the public taxpayer. This is deeply disturbing. I asked a question in here a few weeks ago of the Prime Minister about comments that were made by the CEO and the chief operating officer of Snowy Hydro that said that not only was there nothing to support in the marketplace the erection of a new coal-fired power station but that any attempt to do so would make the viability of Snowy 2.0 deeply questionable. In fact, 'unviable' was the word the chief operating officer used. This is a government who's photobombed the Snowy 2.0 project and sung its praises but are the worst enemy of the Snowy 2.0 project. </span>

This government needs to take responsibility for future generations and for our business community and our consumers, get its act together on renewable energy and climate change, and do it now before it's too late.</span>

It was the semifinals of the National Netball League, and the reigning champions, the Sunshine Coast Lightning, won. They beat the Firebirds, admittedly in a nailbiter by just one point, 56-57. I confess I am a Sunny Coast local and I'm therefore a little bit parochial. I'm also a card-carrying supporter of Lightning, but that is not why I rise in the House today. I want to pay tribute to Sunshine Coast Lightning not just for their latest win but to acknowledge how they conduct themselves on and off the court. They are a united team of high-performing individuals whose contribution to the local community is every bit as large as their contribution to the game. Indeed, they hold themselves with such dignity and also such humility when they win that the Sunshine Coast Lightning are role models not only for young up-and-coming netball players but for all of us, and I wish them luck in the weeks ahead. Go the Lightning!</span>

It's something you've all heard me go on and on about since the first time I set foot in this parliament. It's the Denny Avenue railway level crossing in Kelmscott, which is just down the road from my office and is Western Australia's most dangerous level crossing and, indeed, its most dangerous 400-metre stretch of road. In the past five years alone, more than 100 crashes have been recorded on this short road. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to stand here today and tell you that work on fixing this level crossing and replacing it with a new underpass and elevated rail line will begin in 2019. I first began working on getting this level crossing fixed in the early 2000s as a community representative on the consultative group for the Armadale redevelopment authority. After being dubbed the state's most dangerous road, the crossing remained neglected for many years. It was ignored by successive state and federal Liberal governments, but, in 2015, I secured a commitment from federal Labor to replace that level crossing, which we recommitted to at the last federal election. Then, working with my state counterpart, Armadale state member Tony Buti, we saw the election of the new McGowan WA Labor government and, through their commitment of funding and the pressure on this federal government by us, federal representatives from WA, we have been able to see our dream realised by the replacement of this level crossing, starting in 2019, with a new underpass, making the trip for so many commuters in my electorate safer and faster. </span>

On Saturday, my good mate the member for Fisher, Andrew Wallace, and I, together with about 40 other riders, participated in the Queensland leg of the Black Dog Ride. Starting out at Old Petrie Town, we rode into Gympie's Nelson Reserve, where we were greeted by many wellwishers. The riders will go on to Mackay, Charters Towers, Mount Isa, Tennant Creek and finish in Darwin, and they will be speaking with local communities along the way about mental health. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Black Dog Ride began in 2009, when Steve Andrews, following the loss of a friend to suicide, set off on a ride around Australia to raise awareness about depression. The ride is now a national charity event, supported by thousands of Australians, raising funds for mental health programs. It encourages people to talk about depression and suicide and to seek help as early as possible. It is a very sad fact that eight Australians every day lose their lives to suicide. That's one every three hours. The Black Dog Ride aims to reduce the toll by talking about mental health and letting people know there is help available. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to give a shout-out to my friend Donna Griffin and Michael Young, known as 'Youngie', and everyone involved in the ride. I wish them well. Watch out for kangaroos and emus and stay upright. </span>

Some of the most shocking individual cases include a 12-year-old boy who has overdosed twice in the past fortnight, an 11-year-old girl who is suicidal, an eight-year-old boy with autism in need of substantial support and a 27-year-old woman with depression and psychosis. She was sexually assaulted on Nauru and is so afraid to leave her accommodation that she has felt forced to urinate in a bucket. There is also a 28-year-old man with a significant knee injury, who waited six days for an X-ray; a 33-year-old man with nerve injury to his hand; a 46-year-old man who has been waiting 4Â½ years for surgery for a serious bowel condition; a 44-year-old man who is blind in one eye after an assault during the 2014 Nauru riot and who is now almost blind in the other; a 56-year-old woman who cares for a disabled son, so depressed she is suicidal; and a 30-year-old new mother with severe anxiety and depression. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  I rise to speak about a great family-owned business in my electorate that has just celebrated its 80th anniversary. The story of Linke's Bakehouse &amp; Pantry started in the Depression of 1933, when Jack Linke left the family farm to find work in the Barossa Valley. After five years working in the Barossa, Jack purchased a bakery in Nuriootpa and began the family business that has become so successful today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1961 Jack decided it was time for one of his four sons to take over the business, and Brian and his wife, Jan, put their hands up to take it over. Brian, Jan and their three children moved into the building that housed the family home, with a retail stop at the front and a bakery at the back. In 1980, it was decided that they would expand the business by converting their family home into an indoor-outdoor dining area. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The story of Linke's bakery is like many small businesses that are the backbone of this country. From Jack taking a risk and giving it a go in 1938 to the hard work of his family over many decades, from children and grandchildren through to great-grandchildren, Linke's bakehouse has become an iconic Barossa Valley business, situated in the main street of Nuriootpa. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My congratulations go to the now matriarch, Jan Linke, her son Chris and his wife, Tamra, as well as Sharon Edward for not only the last 80 years but also continuing this successful business for many future generations. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It will be a joyous day for many of us on this side of the House. The day after the by-election, the Prime Minister said to all Australians that he was going to look very thoughtfully and humbly at the way the people voted. The people of Australia are unaccustomed to humility from this Prime Minister, but something he can show humility on is his attitude to the One Nation party. People should be quite concerned about the way that this government was very keen to play footsies with the One Nation party in the Queensland by-elections. The people have sent a very clear message that you cannot walk both sides of the street. The question for the Prime Minister is this: will he now direct the Liberal and National Party operations to put the One Nation party last in the forthcoming federal election? It is a pretty simple question: will you direct your machine to put the One Nation party last in the forthcoming federal election? There have been Liberal Party prime ministers who have had the courage to send a direction to their party machines to do that. In October 2000 Prime Minister John Howard did exactly that. It's time for this Prime Ministerâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

A lot of publicity and attention has quite rightly been on eastern Australia, New South Wales and Queensland, but it is my melancholy duty to inform you that it also affects at least part of my electorate. Last Wednesday night at short notice I held a drought forum at the Arno Bay Hotel, which is on the eastern Eyre Peninsula. About 75 people rolled up. I'm indebted to the Centrelink officer, Rob Holtham, and the rural financial counsellors, Chris Fitzgerald and Charlie Goode, for attending. Large swathes of land across Eyre Peninsula and other places around the electorateâthe upper end of the Mid North, the eastern side of the Mid North, the North East Pastoral Districtâare all dealing with these issues. A large area in the middle of the Eyre Peninsula has just received very good rainfall of 40 to 50 millimetres at the western end, but at the eastern end less so: around 15 millimetres. A lot of land is drifting and a lot of farmers are struggling with that scenario at the moment, trying to get cover on their properties. It was a good opportunity to run through the changes that the Prime Minister announced the weekend before around the farm household allowance, the lifting of the thresholds, and the extra $12,000 that would go to a couple. In fact the total package for farming couples could be as high as $46,000 over a 12-month period. They were very interested in what we had to say.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  In early July we saw the devastation of wildfires on the Attica coast in Greece. They were the second-deadliest wildfires in this century, after the 2009 Black Saturday fires here in Australia. I know the member for Hindmarsh was in Greece at the time, and I pay tribute to him and the work that he did there. I also pay tribute to many Greek organisations like the Orthodox Church and the Federation of the Greek Orthodox Communities of Australia for the fundraising efforts that have gone on here in relation to those deadly fires. We know that those fires claimed the lives of 94 people. I was talking at the football to a friend of mine, Athena, and her daughters had been in the very town where the wildfires took place the day before. Over recent weeks we've watched the devastation of the fires burning in Greece. While these images appear far away, these fires have personal connections to the electorate of Barton and to everyone else that has constituents of Hellenic background. In Barton we have an amazing Greek community, with many Greek families living there, and I know that they have been touched very personally by these fires. I put on record on behalf of the Labor Partyâand all members of this House, I'm sureâthat our thoughts are with the people of Greece and those that have been affected so devastatingly by these fires.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  In the 2018 federal budget the Australian government committed to a fourth round of the Stronger Communities Program, a program every member in this House has enjoyed assisting their communities with. Last week I had the pleasure of writing to all of my local community groups to inform them about the fourth round of the Stronger Communities grants program and to encourage all of those interested groups to make an application. The Stronger Communities grants program supports the government's commitment to deliver social benefits across Australia by funding small capital projects in every one of the 150 electorates represented in this place. The SCP's intended outcomes are to improve local community participation and contribute to vibrant and healthy communities. In my community on the northern Gold Coast, the previous three rounds of funding have been well received and the benefits have been outstanding. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth round of funding will provide $22Â½ million, which equates to $150,000 per electorate. There are a maximum of 20 projects per electorate, and of course total Commonwealth funding for each project cannot exceed 50 per cent of the total eligible project cost. Community groups have some skin in the game. The remaining share of eligible project costs can be funded from any source, including state and local government funding. The minimum grant amount is $2,500 and the maximum is $20,000. So I strongly encourage members of my community to consider making an application to this wonderful program and to contact my office if they would like more information.</span>

The Prime Minister's words are ringing in my ears. He said that he would look very seriously and thoughtfully, and humbly, at the way in which voters responded to what the government put forward during the by-elections. With real concern, I hope that this Prime Minister is thinking about the compact on multiculturalism that he breached in his extraordinary intervention not only on New Year's Day but since, which singles out the South Sudanese community in Melbourne for approbation. I hope that he is thinking about the climate change denial people that he has been cosying up to in the One Nation party. I hope that he's thinking about his dismissal, out of hand, of the reconciliation process, of the Uluru statement and the recommendations around an Indigenous voice. </span>

I hope he understands that the Australian people want to see $17 billion spent on schools and hospitals and not in big business tax cuts and money for the banks. Let the Prime Minister come in here today and tell us he's really learnt his lessons. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  I'm taking this opportunity to get a better deal for our farmers. I'm calling on Coles, Woolworths, ALDI Australia and IGA Australia to consider increasing the amount they pay our farmers for their produce. Last week I sent letters to them and a parcel to Channel 9 asking them to put public pressure on retail giants and get more money returned to our primary producers. Nothing has been done. My farmers have asked: is it because these grocery giants pay for advertising during commercial shows? Has that stopped them exposing the unfair financial returns to farmers? An extra 20c a litre for milk, an extra 20c a kilogram for produce and an extra 20c per dozen eggs from their profit would make a huge difference to our primary producers. Many everyday Aussies have said they're happy to see an increase if it goes back to our farmers. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dairy farmers feel betrayed since deregulation, because the free market they were promised has never eventuated. Instead, we have a form of price fixing. If that happened in any other industry it would come under severe scrutiny. Milk is used as a loss leader to get customers into the back of their stores. Shame on each and every one of these giant retailers. They're manipulating the dairy industry into the dust of the drought. Farmers can't build a financial buffer against hard times. The return to the farmers for their hard 24/7 work, early hours and no holidays is worth more. They need to be able to build a buffer. We pay twice the price for water than we pay for milk. How is that fair? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As a result of the Longman by-election, this union has delivered a primary vote for the LNP of just 29 per cent in Queensland. We know that Pauline Hanson's One Nation has decided to vote with the government almost 100 per cent of the time this year. In fact, recent articles in the Fairfax Media reported that Senator Hanson is the most reliable voting partner that the government has in the Senate. Despite what they say, One Nation is not a party for the battlers. It is a party like this government, a party for big business. Time and time again, we see that Senator Hanson's One Nation is not the friend of the Australian battler. It's only friends with the Prime Minister and his big-business mates.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the people of Australia have repeatedly rejected what One Nation stands for. Did you hear the message from Longman, yes or no? Clearly this Prime Minister remains out of touch. The government is friends with a party who sells out battlers, who sells out apprentices, who sells out on climate change, and who sells out on seniors and the battlers of this nation. When will this government learn to dump One Nation and follow in the footsteps of John Howard, who said, 'My view is that One Nation party should be placed last on all Liberal Party how-to-vote cards'? 'If you won't listen to John Howard, start listening to the people of Australiaâand, more importantly, listen to the message from Longman.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  The electorate of Forde is fortunate to have so many up-and-coming sporting champions, both young men and young women, across many codes. Indeed, some of the talent nurtured in my electorate has gone on to achieve international successâto name just a few: Rugby League's Cameron Smith and Corey Parker; Rugby Union's Peter Slattery and Israel Folau; swimmer Jodie Henry; sprinter Trae Williams; and boxer Alex Leapei. All are internationally recognised. But there are more stars being nurtured on the school ovals and gymnasiums and in the sporting clubs around the Forde community. Sport brings people together from many different backgrounds, and is the foundation for the strong community spirit we enjoy in Forde. Being part of a sporting team encourages students to build key life skills, including self-discipline, patience and persistence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government plays a key role in supporting future sporting champions through our Local Sporting Champions grants. I recently had the honour of handing out seven of these grants to future sporting stars attending schools in Forde. I'd like to congratulate these seven students: Kaleb Nolan, Jacinta Ens, Dakota King, Monet Broughton-Ferris and Layton Reid from Park Ridge State High School, and Teapo Stoltman from Marsden State High School. The Forde electorate is proud of its sporting heritage, and we look forward to watching the champions of the future sign their names in national and international halls of fame.</span>

I'm very happy to see thatâsomeone that personifies Labor values more than almost anyone else in the chamber. But I am concerned that what I saw in Longmanânot the 10 per cent drop in the primary vote of the Liberal and National parties; that's a problem for those oppositeâwas three out of 20 voters who supported the One Nation political party.</span>

She has said: 'I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians.' She has called for the Muslim faith to be banned. She has said: 'Islam is a disease, we need to vaccinate ourselves against that.' She has disrespectfully worn a burqa into the Senate. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, how could any sensible, mainstream political party of government swap preferences with a party that stands for such hatred? It was a grubby deal, and the Prime Minister should have known better. Why? Because Prime Minister Howard said in 2000: 'the One Nation Party should be placed last on all Liberal Party how-to-vote cards in Australia.' And just last year, Senator Ron Boswell, someone who knows a little bit about Queensland politics, warned against swapping preferences with One Nation. I've mentioned the hillbilly-harbourside alliance before, but now we're literally seeing their boundaries blurringâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  Last week I had a big turnout at my roundtable on Labor's retiree and pensioners' tax. It just goes to show how worried the community is about Labor's retiree tax grab. I want to thank the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer, the honourable member for Deakin, for coming out to my electorate to hear my constituents' concerns. Many people had horror stories about what Labor's policy will mean to them. Betty, a self-funded retiree from Wynnum, told me that it would affect her portfolio greatly, potentially forcing her to dip into capital. Dennis from Wakely told the room that, in terms of his own super fund, he stands to lose 20 per cent of his income if Labor gets its proposal through. I didn't invite millionaires to this session. They weren't the top end of town, as Labor would have you believe they're targeting with this tax. These are ordinary people who've tried to be self-reliant. Now Labor want to take 20 to 30 per cent of their income to fund their unsustainable spending. Almost a million retirees and pensioners will be immediately affected. Dave from Mansfield also made a great point. He was a third-generation Labor voter until he heard about this reckless new policy. Now he's worried about younger people's ability to generate a decent income for their future. I invite all my constituents who would like to share their own story about this terrible tax of Labor's to contact me immediately.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="885" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TURNBULL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:06</span>):  I rise to update the House on the drought, to affirm the nation's support for our courageous farmers and farming communities and to outline measures we are taking to help. All of New South Wales and two-thirds of Queensland are officially in drought, with many other areas suffering too. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, it's the worst drought in New South Wales since the mid-1960s and may turn out to be worse. Unlike a fire or a flood, which inflict immediate physical damage to people, property, homes and infrastructure, a drought is insidious, longer and more widespread. Farmers find themselves going to enormous expense just to keep their livestock alive in the hope of rain, physically working harder than ever and losing money all the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of drought preparation and management is timely destocking but that raises the awful question of whether you'll be able to afford to restock when the drought breaks. The New South Wales farmer who destocked six months ago will feel confident he made the right call. His neighbour may wish he had done the same, but if it had rained five months ago their perceptions would be reversed. The croppers are facing hard times as well. Many winter crops sewn will fail and others won't be sewn at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our climate is tough but so are our farmers. They are resourceful, resilient and innovative, quick to develop and adopt new technologies. Agriculture contributes three per cent to our economy, a gross value of $60 billion in 2017-18. Australian farmers export about 77 per cent of what they produce. Farm exports, aided by our big free trade agreements, earnt $44.8 billion in 2016-17, up from $32.5 billion in 2010-11.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Farmers' Federation's vision for a $100 billion a year farm gate industry is undaunted by the drought. In 2016-17 304,000 people were directly employed in agriculture, with the complete supply chain, including food and fibre industries, providing over 1.6 million jobs. Governments need to respond swiftly and effectively. There is no set and forget here. Just as the drought evolves, so must our policy responses. We have to be as practical and clear-eyed as the farmers we're supporting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I announced a $190 million drought package, bringing our government's drought policy commitment to more than $576 million. The farm household allowance, typically around $16,000, is being supplemented this year by two one-off payments amounting to $12,000 per couple. We've also extended the availability of the farm household allowance for another year and eased the asset test. Thousands more farmers will be eligible. I urge farmers to ensure they're getting all the help that's available by seeking advice from the rural financial counsellors we've engaged. We have also provided $11.4 million for mental health support initiatives and $15 million for not-for-profit community groups in drought-affected areas. This is in addition to the more than $852 million in concessional loans for drought and other assistance approved to 1,559 farm businesses since 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Regional Investment Corporation, established on 1 July, has $2 billion available for concessional loans to farm businesses and over $2 billion for concessional loans for water infrastructure that will enhance water security and support regional economies. In 2016, to support resilience, we doubled the amount farmers could put into farm management deposits to $800,000, changing the law to allow them to be used as offsets against a farmer's mortgage. A record $6.6 billion was held in 55,000 accounts at 30 June this year so that many farmers putting money aside, free of tax, in good years can bring to account in tough years like this one. We are also working on further long-term measures to improve the resilience of our rural communities and will be announcing the next phase of our drought support in coming weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like finally to commend everyone who has rallied behind our farmers and the communities who support them. I want to thank families, businesses and charities but also the kids. Young Maisie in Western Australia gave two years of her pocket money to help the farmers. There is young Jack at St John the Baptist Catholic Primary School in Freshwater, whose Fiver for a Farmer campaign has raised 10 times what he'd hoped for. When nature throws its worst at us, it brings out the best in Australians. To our farmers, who grow the food we eat and the fibre we wear, we thank you for your tenacity and courage. Now, in these hard, dry times, more than ever, we have your back.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00ATG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:12</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister for his words. Last week, my wife Chloe and I, along with the member for Hunter, had the privilege of visiting Longreach, Ilfracombe, Barcaldine and Emerald in Western Queensland. We had the privilege of listening to locals, who are battling this devastating drought. They generously welcomed us and educated us. Jody Brown, who runs sheep and cattle on Latrobe Station, out of Longreach, told me a lot of farmers feel like the drought cycles are getting longer and longer and the periods of relief and rain are getting shorter and shorter. Her words remind us that climate change is not some graph on a page in a report; it has devastating consequences for families and their livelihoods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Aaron Skinn, a very hardworking baker who runs a family bakery in Barcaldine, told me: 'Drought is hitting not just farms but the local towns as well.' This is why we need a coordinated national approach to deal with this one-in-100-year event. This means mobilising the resources of the Commonwealth to ensure that farmers can get their fodder, grain or water, while also maintaining biosecurity so that we're not transporting fire ants along with it. We need to make sure also that the jobs in the local cafe, the produce store and the metal fabricators are secure. If we keep the farms going, we keep the towns going.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people who call this part of Australia home are brave and proud. But farming life can be precarious, as we currently witness. I think it takes a lot for them to ask for help from Canberra. So when they do, we should recognise that the need is dire. That is why Labor has said that the $12,000 in government assistance for families shouldn't be divided and staggered over one payment in September this year and one next March. If you need the lot up-front, you should just get it up-front. There should be no piles of paperwork and no bureaucratic delays. I think there's more we can do as a parliament to build water infrastructure in communities and on farms, and to work with the agronomists resowing the pasture. Let me also say to the big banks: you relied on government guarantee to get you through the global financial crisis; we will hold you to account for the way you treat communities in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has recently reached $700 million in penalties from the Commonwealth Bank. Prime Minister, together we should think about putting some of that money into drought relief rather than giving it back to banks as a tax break. Prime Minister, together let's work on a plan to reinvest these penalties in some of the people who've suffered more than their fair share of rip-offs from the banks. And, like the Prime Minister, I briefly want to thank everyone in our cities who's digging deep to support the various appeals and fundraisers. There are lots of people organising some fantastic initiatives, from something as simple as 'Parma for a farmer' to the big drought relief concert set to be headlined by the great Australian Johnny Farnham next Monday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barcaldine of course is where the Labor Party was born. But when I was there I also spoke with plenty of lifelong National Party people about what this parliament can do. At times like this, political identity is so far down the list that it doesn't matter. There are not LNP Australians going through the drought or Labor Australians going through the drought; there are just Australians. I think I speak for all members in this place when I say to farmers in dire need: you are our fellow Australians, and we are on your side.</span>

We well remember the honourable member standing here some years ago saying that lower company tax will result in more productivity, more investment, more jobs and higher wages. We remember that; the microphone was on when he said that. We all know that normally he doesn't say what he's thinking when he's on mic. We saw him on his outback tour and he said, 'I'm on mic; I can't say what I'm thinking.' The reality is that Australians never know what the Leader of the Opposition is thinking, because he says one thing to one group and another to another group. What was he saying to the $11,000-a-head fundraiser sponsored by Macquarie Bank and Genworth? I wonder what he was saying there. Do you think he was saying that company taxes should be higher? I'm sure he was trying to weasel his way around there, trying to tap back to an earlier position.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You won't get any consistency from the Leader of the Opposition. All we know is that time and time again he tells people what they want to hear. He has no consistency, and that is why he cannot be trusted. He's failed to give Australians straight answers on tax. He's failed, just as he failed to protect his members in the Australian Workers Union. He goes around and talks about penalty ratesâa very important part of our industrial system, determined by the independent umpire, whose rulings he always said he would support. But then, of course, when he was the leader of the AWU, one group of low-paid workers after another were abandoned by the Leader of the Opposition. He failed them, as he fails Australians. When he's on mic he doesn't say what he's thinking, so he's assured us, and when he's off mic he's no more reliable than when he's on.</span>

Last week, the honourable member and I saw firsthand how small businesses in his electorate of Swan are taking advantage of the lower business taxes that we have delivered, and Labor would stop, to increase investment and employment. Businesses like Thermo King West, a family-owned refrigeration business, employing 23 workers, will now, according to its owner, Steve Da Rui, invest more money back into the business and take on new apprentices as a result of that additional investment. The member for Swan and I met two of those new apprentices being trained on the premises. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right across Australia, small family-owned businesses like Thermo King West are increasing investment and creating jobs, because they know they have the backing of our government that is committed to lower taxes. They know that our coalition Liberal-National government is committed to lower taxes. Under our government, businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million will pay a 25 per cent rate of tax, less than they would pay under Labor. Unlike the members opposite, the government understand the critical role of businesses in creating jobs, and that's why we're backing small and medium family-owned businesses with lower taxes. It's why we've seen record jobs growth, more than 400,000 jobs created last year alone, and the lowest percentage of Australians of working age on welfare in 25 years. That's the confidence in investment and employment that is helping to build a stronger economy and the stronger government revenues that come from it. That's why we're able to bring the budget back into balance a year earlier. It's why we're able to guarantee essential services, investing record amounts in hospitals, schools, infrastructure and security, and it's what's enabling us to deliver tax relief to families, to individuals, through our comprehensive Personal Income Tax Plan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe in lower tax. We want every Australian, beginning with low- and middle-income earners, to keep more of what they earn, and the personal income tax reform which the parliament recently passed and which the opposition voted against delivers just that. It delivers immediate relief of up to $530 a year for working Australians, while addressing bracket creep so that Australians are paying lower taxes for any extra dollar they earn. By the time the plan is delivered, 94 per cent of Australians will pay no more than 32Â½c for any extra dollar they earn. That's real reform. </span>

What we saw in Queensland during that campaign from the ALP was a tissue of lies, an absolute farrago of dishonesty. How do we know this? In the metro north area, which includes the Caboolture Hospital, what did Queensland Labor do in 2016-17? They cut funding to their own area, to their own hospitals, by $20 million. These are not our figures; these are their figures. It was a cut by Queensland Labor about which the Leader of the Opposition was palpably silent, about which he said nothing and about which he put them in witness protection. What we saw was a $20 million cut from Queensland Labor. They're the facts. What did we do on our side in that period? There was a $120 million increase in federal funding to the metro north area: minus 20, Queensland Labor; plus 120, the federal coalition government. Those are the facts, based on not just our figures but the Queensland government's figures and those of the independent assessors in this space. So, whilst we've gone up, they have reduced funding by $20 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does that mean? That means that Queensland is providing less money for beds in Caboolture Hospital, less money for services in Caboolture Hospital and less money for other treatments in Caboolture Hospital. At the same time, what we have just done is guarantee $11 million for increased drug and alcohol funding in Caboolture, where there is an issue in relation to methamphetamines and the challenge on the streets which was raised by so many people. So we're increasing funding, Queensland Labor is decreasing funding and, when it really counts, federal Labor hid the fact that their own people in their own state are taking money away from their own hospitals.</span>

The Labor Party voted against it, and they want to take the $140 billion legislated tax relief plan if they are elected, cut it in halfâcut it clear in halfâand take back the relief that those hardworking Australians deserve and that this House and the other place have legislated to deliver to those Australians. If you're voting Labor, you're voting for higher taxes. It's that simple. They want to take away the tax relief that this government has provided to 10 million taxpayers who are getting that immediate relief, including 50,000 in the member for Gilmore's electorateâthat urgent straight-up relief.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we're dealing with bracket creep. We're making sureâparticularly for younger people who look out over the next 10 years and see those tax brackets changingâthat, as they earn more, they won't be taxed more. The end part of the plan is the strongest, in that 94 per cent of Australians will not pay a marginal income tax rate greater than 32Â½c. That's the biggest tax relief that the Australian people have seen for a long time, and it's being delivered by a government who believes in lower taxes because we believe in a fair go for those who have a go. We believe that it's their money and they should get to keep more of what they have earned.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Governor of the Reserve Bank says it's good for the economy. Phil Lowe, the governor, said just this past week that household disposable income growth will be supported by the reduction in personal taxesâso a stronger economy to support the services that Australia relies on and lower taxes to back in the hardworking effort of working Australians.</span>

I note that I think around 58 more electors in Braddon voted for the Labor Party at the by-election than had at the general election, so there was a very small swing to the Labor Party, but it wasn't a result that would set by-election records, to say the least. But the honourable member is back, and we welcome her back. The honourable member comes back knowing that the Tasmanian economy is doing better now than it has for many years. It's doing better now because of Will Hodgman's Liberal government, because of the pro-business policies that we have delivered and because one small and medium business after another in the electorate of Braddon is investing and employing. In fact in the last monthly jobs figures Tasmania saw an extra 2,100 new jobs. It was a very substantial increase in employment, and it was a result of the encouragement that we are providing to business and investment. We are providing that encouragement, and that is delivering the confidence we're seeing across Tasmania and the honourable member's electorate. I have to say to the honourable member that the greatest threat to the jobs in her electorate would be the election of the party she is a member of to the federal government.</span>

They are the party, in partnership with the Labor Party, which saw electricity prices increase each and every year when they were in office. Prices doubled. The member for Melbourne should know better. The modelling that was undertaken by ACIL Allen was for the Energy Security Board, and their detailed report very clearly made public the technology costs, fuel costs, capital costs, exchange rate, inflation rateâall the inputs which went into establishing that, together with the National Energy Guarantee, Australian households will be $550 a year better off, which will see the wholesale price of power come down by about 20 per cent. That is significant. That means hundreds of thousands of dollars to be saved by hospitals and supermarkets, and millions of dollars to be saved by chemical and paper manufacturersâblue-collar workers that the Greens don't even pretend to represent, because the Greens are all about ideology. The coalition, when it comes to energy policy, is focusing on engineering and economics. The reality is that we have listened to the independent experts, that this policy has been backed by business, industry and consumer groups, and that this policy, together with existing policies, will reduce power prices by $550 a year.</span>

Further to the member for Calare's question, the Liberals and Nationals have delivered historic tax relief for hardworking mums and dads and for businesses right throughout the Central West of New South Wales. They are doing it tough. They need every dollar that they can get so that they can reinvest it in their own business, because that's what good small businesses do. They get a bit of tax relief and reinvest it in their own business. They give that young Australian their first start or they give that the older Australianâwho might be transitioning from one long career and have fallen on hard timesâa new career. They get work with a small business, particularly one in a regional area who is willing to give them a go.</span>

It was part of my small business road show; I dropped in there. Wayne Barker has had the business since 1978. He is having a go. They're the sorts of people who we want to back; they're the sorts of people who the Treasurer is backing with the historic tax relief. It is the lowest tax rate for 78 years, which was brought about thanks to a Liberals and Nationals government. There is Akehurst Bakery in Blayney. It's is owned by Matthew and Denise Hutchison. It is another great little small business in the Central West.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Central West is doing it tough because of the drought, but we are there backing them with tax relief. We are also backing infrastructure, such as $2.3 million of bridge replacements, making sure that these regional communities are connected and making sure that we get those vital linkage points from the farm gate to the rail line, or on better roads, to the ports and to the markets. There are our free trade agreements that we've been able to broker with South Korea, Japan, China and Peru. That was thanks to the good work by the trade minister and his assistant, the member for Parkes. We are making sure that we get those trade points backed up through better roads and bridges, such as the bridge on Browns Creek Road, the Blayney overbridge and the Goodiman bridge. There is $2.5 million for an upgrade at Bathurst Regional Airport, another piece of vital infrastructure. There is $10 million for Velocity Park under the Building Better Regions Fund. These are all funding measures that will go if this man ever becomes Prime Minister.</span>

You know what? It was the Western Australian Labor government that signed that agreement with the Prime Minister and that reached that agreement at the COAG earlier this year. On a bipartisan basis, what we saw is the commencement of a process that is now seen as part of a $30 billion increase in hospital funding around Australia. Three Labor states and territories and three coalition states and territories signed up to more hospital funding, and what do we see in Western Australia? In Labor's last year in government, federal funding was $1.4 billion. This year it's $2.2 billion, but under the Prime Minister and the coalition government's agreement it will grow to $3.2 billion. That will be a $3Â½ billion increase in federal funding to Western Australia for hospitals. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You know what's interesting? At the same time, we know from what the Western Australian government has told us that the Leader of the Opposition and the federal ALP tried to stop WA from signing the agreement. They tried to stop Western Australia from signing up to more hospital funding. So you understand what this is about for the Leader of the Opposition. It's not about more hospital funding in WAâor in Queensland, because he was silent about the slashing cuts of the Palaszczuk government in Queensland. It's not about more funding in Western Australia, because he tried to stop the Western Australian Labor government from signing up to an agreement with the federal government. It's about taking any chance of an advantage, at the cost of the very people he purports to represent. That's his history. That's his practice. That's his approach not just as Leader of the Opposition; that was also his approach when he was a minister in the previous government and when he was a union leader, ripping money off the most vulnerable workers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, what you see is $3.4 billion of additional federal funding for Western Australia for hospitals, an increase from $1.4 billion to more than double that, $3.4 billion, from when Labor were last in government to when our new hospital agreement reaches its final year. That's real investment, and you can only do that when you've got an economy which supports the ability to invest in new hospitals, in new treatments and in new medicines.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:41</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for O'Connor for his question and I'd like to publicly thank him for inviting me to his electorate, where I heard firsthand what a great job he's doing on the ground, particularly his role in providing important tax relief to the people in his electorate of O'Connor. He, like every member of the government team, believes in how important it is to provide tax relief for hardworking Australians, because we understand that Australians work hard for their money, and their money belongs to them. We get that, but plainly those opposite do not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we have delivered tax relief for small, medium sized and family enterprises, which employ around five million Australians, including 20,000 businesses in the member for O'Connor's own electorate. It's why we have also delivered personal income tax relief for more than 61,000 low- and middle-income earners in O'Connor and for around 10 million people right around the country, thanks to our legislated Personal Income Tax Plan. And we did that despite those opposite fighting us every single step of the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for O'Connor asked me: are there any threats? Standing in the retiree forums that he organised, I did hear a lot about threats, particularly the threat of the Leader of the Opposition's mega retiree tax, a $55 billion hit on retirees, those people who can least afford it. What that would mean is that, under Labor, around 6,000 people in the member for O'Connor's electorate would lose their tax refunds. For some of those people, I heard, that represents about 30 per centâ30 per centâof their income. We know that it will hit around a million people right around the country. That's grandmas and grandpas. That's men and women. That's mums and dads. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shame on Labor, shame, for wanting to steal the tax refunds of hardworking Australiansâbecause these people are not the top end of town. They're not the millionaires that the Leader of the Opposition likes to pretend they are. In fact, 96 per cent of them have a taxable income of less than $87,000. These are low- and middle-income earnersâ</span>

What is it that he has against people wanting to be self-reliant in retirement? And what other nasties does he have up his sleeve?

They've abandoned the voters in the seat of Leichhardt. They've abandoned the voters in the seat of Flynn. They've abandoned the voters in the seat of Capricornia. And they've abandoned the voters in the seat of Dawson. Sixty-four thousand people are employed with the reef. It provides more than $6 billion to the Australian economy, and it has been the Turnbull government that has raised and supported extra money for the reef.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, at the end of the day, the Leader of the Opposition knows the only reason he is raising this is because, under the Labor Party, the environment department's funding for reef projects was around 50 per cent lower than what it is under the coalition and that under the Labor Party, their last year in office, base funding for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority was nearly half of what it is today. The Labor Party knows that when they were in government they put the reef on the path to the endangered list. And the Labor Party knows that when they were in government they had no long-term plan and no funding for the reef. Only the coalition will stand up for regional jobs in Queensland and will support the reef with a record investment of funding.</span>

When Labor was in government, they lost control of the borders. The worst part is that Labor has not learnt the lesson of six years of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. The fact is that they presided over 50,000 people coming on 800 boats, and 1,200 people drowned at sea. They put 8,000 children into detention and, at the next election, they promise to do it all again. The fact is that the Left of the Labor Party is dictating policy in relation to this particular area. We know that, over the course of the last couple of weeks, the ACTU and others have been out there calling for a shift in the Labor Party's position to weaken Labor's position on border protection, but that is exactly what Julia Gillard fell for and it's exactly what Kevin Rudd fell for. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We aren't going to allow the people smugglers to get back into business. People who believe that somehow this problem has been dealt with and the problem has gone away don't recognise that we've turned back 33 boats over the last couple of years. We've disrupted over 70 attempts to put people onto boats to send them to Australia. We have already seen tens of thousands of people cross the Mediterranean at the beginning of this year into Europe. The problem has not gone away. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have secured our borders, but we've done much more than that. We have gone through people who are here as noncitizensâthat is, those people who are here on visasâand we have cancelled more visas of criminals in the last 12 months than Labor did in six years. We've been able to deal with a number of outlaw motorcycle gang members who were involved in the distribution of ice. They are the criminals who are responsible for importation and distribution of drugs in this country. At the same time, we've been able to get off Manus and Nauru 371 of the people that Labor put on Manus and Nauru. I did not put a single person on Manus or Nauru, but I am getting them off. The Labor Party put them on, because they lost control of our borders. As sure as night follows day, if this Leader of the Opposition is elected as Prime Minister in this country, those detention centres will refill overnight. The fact is that, when you look across the backbench, there is one after the other who advocates a watering-down of Labor's position, and what that would result in is giving control back to the people smugglers, who would see people back on boats, kids drowning at sea and kids back in detention, and, for that, they should be condemned. </span>

Today the foundation's CEO explained that no-one in the foundation was contacted and she wasn't even aware there was a due diligence process underway. Could the Prime Minister now give us three minutes detailing the extensive due diligence that his minister referred to? </span>

This was based on three things: the Great Barrier Reef Foundation's proven track record in leveraging philanthropic support as Australia's largest reef-dedicated charity; the foundation's longstanding, extensive experience working with my department and other key stakeholders for more than a decade; and the first phase of due diligence by my department, which looked at its governance, structure, constitution, project management, fundraising history, capacity for growth, board composition and scientific expertise. </span>

In Victoria they cheered on the Labor government in the closure of Hazelwood. In Victoria, AEMO have indicated that there could be up to a 43 per cent chance of load shedding. That is a result of the Labor government in Victoria not putting lower power prices at the top of the priority list.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the coalition government have been doing exactly that. We've intervened in the gas market to get more gas available to Australians before it goes offshore. We've abolished the ability of the networks to game the system, which will save Australian customers billions of dollars. We have secured a better deal for Australian households, as they've moved on to better market offers from the more expensive standing offers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan is working. The wholesale cost of electricity is down around 25 per cent this year, with the price last week at $68 a megawatt hour compared to $101 a megawatt hour at the same time the year before. On 1 July, power bills came down in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia. And hopefully they will go down in Victoria when they do their re-setting in January of next year. This is saving households and businesses hundreds of dollars as well.</span>

The wholesale price will come down by about 20 per cent, which could be worth millions of dollars to energy intensive customers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't have to take my word for it. Listen to what the Queensland chamber of industry and commerce, representing 400,000 plus Queensland small business owners, said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">At the end of the day, the National Energy Guarantee promises what we've all been waiting forâa downward pressure on electricity prices and policy certainty.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">BHP, the biggest user of power in South Australia, said, 'We expect the guarantee will result in lower power prices'. The Business Council of Australia, representing thousands of millions of workers in various forms across the country, said, 'It's a practical, workable solution that prioritises reliable and affordable power. The NEG is a game changer and has the full support of business'. The Farmers' Federation said, 'Support from the National Energy Guarantee is a support for certainty. Our message is pretty simple, we want some policy certainty, for us it is the best game in town'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Labor Party will accelerate the closure of coal-fired power stationsâthe Labor Party are obsessed with emissionsâwe are focused on prices and reliability. The National Energy Guarantee will do exactly that.</span>

The honourable member knows very well what happens when you allow ideology and idiocy to take charge of energy policy. He knows very well what happens there in South Australia, where you have the most expensive and the least reliable electricity in Australia. The time has come for engineering and economics; the National Energy Guarantee delivers that. The Energy Security Board, comprising five of the most expert, numerate members of the community associated with energy policy, has delivered this policyâdelivered this plan. It's a good one. It has more support across the community than any energy policy I have seen in decades. That's why it deserves the support of the opposition and all honourable members. </span>

I can tell him and the House that in late June the government announced that BAE Systems Australia would build the nine antisubmarine warfare frigates at a cost of $35 billion in an Australian shipyard at Osborne, using Australian workers and Australian steel, creating jobs here in Australia, and partnering with ASC Shipbuilding, which will be hived off from the ASC submarine company. So we are creating the sovereign defence industry in shipbuilding that we promised over two years agoâa $35 billion commitment to our naval shipbuilding industry, driving highly sophisticated jobs in a high technology industry, which would never have happened if the Labor Party had remained in power. The last naval ship to ever have been built in this country would have been the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney</span>,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>which rolled off the line this year as the third of the air warfare destroyers. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government is investing in our defence industry, creating jobs all around Australia. BAE has already prequalified over 550 companies, small and medium enterprises, in their supply chain around Australia. It's a national project: 160 of those companies are in Victoria, 80 of them are in Western Australia, 100 are in South Australia, 57 are in Queensland, seven are in the Northern Territory, eight are in Tasmania, and about 126 are in New South Walesâso spread right around the country. There are 4,000 jobs directly in the project and in the direct supply chain. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a transformative project for our manufacturing sector. Companies around the country represented in coalition electorates have been prequalified by BAE: Wayout Evacuation Systems in Dunkley, who manufacture specialised signage equipment; SLCE Watermakers Australia, who manufacture reverse osmosis machines, in the seat of Brisbane; Advanced Focus, who provide advisory services on manufacturing processes, in Boothby; and Owen International, who provide specialist equipment like flares, landing aid systems and video imaging systems, in North Sydney. So this story is endlessâone Australian SME after another being part of the national security of the country, being part of the defence of the nation, building the regionally superior antisubmarine warfare frigate, the Hunter class project here in Australia, creating Australian jobs, using Australian steel, in an Australian shipyard, protecting our nation now and into the future.</span>

In his previous answer, the minister claimed there was extensive due diligence and that that examined the fundraising history of the foundation. On 6 August, the environment minister said the foundation had raised $80 million. On 10 August, he said it had raised $60 million, and, a few moments later in the same interview, the figure had gone to $65 million. When the minister can't even give a straight answer on how much they've raised yet says this was part of the due diligence, how can the government claim there was any due diligence on a foundation they didn't even contact?</span>

And in a press release from the member for Watson in 2012, this is what he said about the foundation: 'It protects and preserves the reef. It will ensure that the reef's unique values are protected.' They were the words from the member for Watson. And when we announced our half a billion dollars for the reef, what do you think the member for Sydney said? She's always good for a quote. She said she welcomed the additional funding.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest in this drought that is enveloping much of eastern Australia and particularly his electorate. This is an evolving situation and it's one in which the government will continue to be agile. We understand that it's not just farmers that hurt; it's also small communities that hurt. So it's important we understand that, under the agreements we have with the state, the state's responsibilities during the drought are to look after animal welfareâthe freight and fodderâand it's the federal government's responsibility to look after human welfare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to say that, since we've come to power, we've invested over $1.4 billion not only in concessional loans but in direct support to family households and the communities. Only in the last couple of weeks, we've increased that household support to farming families to $37,626. That's to help them put bread and butter on the table, take the household pressures off them and let them have some clear thinking. But, to complement that, we've invested another $25 million in more rural financial counselling services, and $8Â½ million of that is putting new boots on the ground. This is an investment in the real angels that are out there that sit around farmers' kitchen tables, that get underneath the bonnet of our farmers' businesses and help them make the tough decisions and the strategic decisions about their future. That's an investment in not only agriculture but our people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also looking towards preparedness. We're making big investments into pests and weeds, which cost agriculture around $6 billion a year. And $35 million is being spent ensuring that we increase farm productivity to ensure farmers get from one drought to the next. It's important that we've also brought the banks on this journey with them. We've brought them, kicking and screaming, in offsetting the farm management depositsâthe $6.62 billion in farm management deposits that the banks have from farmers who put aside money in the good times to offset against their loans. It'll save farmers tens of thousands of dollars into the future. That's an investment in agriculture's future. We've got the banks, who are the capital providers to agriculture, to come on that journey with us. We've also made an additional $11.4 million investment into mental health. That's on top of the new investment around allowing the Medicare rebate to be given to those receiving psychological assistance online, for those farmers who are doing it tough. They'll be able to do it in the dignity and sanctity of their own home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I say to every farming family: the story of agriculture is a good one. The story of agriculture is: just add rain. I can tell you that when the rain comes the good times will come, and your government, the Australian people, will stand shoulder to shoulder with you, because we believe not only in you and not only in agriculture but also in your communities.</span>

                  </a>  Well, I would have thought the member for Watson, like the member for Sydney, would welcome half a billion dollars into the reef to underpin regional jobs. That's the key here. The fact is that there was an extensive process of my department working together with the foundation. And when I wrote to the foundation chair, I made it clear that the formal offer of any Australian government funds is dependent on negotiating and executing a new grant agreement. We received their final proposal on 29 May, and on 20 June, under section 71 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act, I approved the grant to the foundation. Having considered a detailed assessment of the application by my department, which recommended to me that 'this would meet the government's policy objective to protect and manage the Great Barrier Reef' and 'would represent value for money and a proper use of Commonwealth resources' and 'would be consistent with the provision of the governance and accountability act', we have succeeded in putting a record amount of funding into the Barrier Reef where Labor failedâmoney into saving the reef and advancing its health, tackling the crown-of-thorns starfish, investing in the science, partnering with farmers to prevent sediment, nitrogen and pesticide run-off. What did Australia's Chief Scientist say when we announced this half a billion dollars? He said, 'It's a great day for the reef and it's a great day for science.' What did the head of the tourism operators in that part of Queensland say? He said, 'It underpins regional jobs in Queensland.' And what did the chair of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority say when we announced that half a billion dollars? He said, 'This is a game changer.' I want to make it clear: there is a 100-page document between the government and the foundation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's been terrific to visit the Baxter station with the member for Dunkley on several occasions, because the member for Dunkley is delivering for his electorate. In the 2016 election he promised $4 million for a business case for the Frankston to Baxter rail upgrade, and that is being delivered. But he went further than that, because in the 2018 budget what did the member for Dunkley deliver? He secured a commitment from the Turnbull government for $225 million for the construction of this upgrade, and on 17 July this year the Victorian Leader of the Opposition, Matthew Guy, promised that a Victorian Liberal-National government would match this with a further $225 million. The Baxter train, the Baxter duplication, is leaving the station. It's an increasingly popular train, because on 31 July the member for Grayndler tried to jump on board, with a manoeuvre he performs from time to time, the ACCCâa set of initials well known in public policy. Here it stands for the 'Albo copy and claim credit' manoeuvre. We saw that on 31 July.</span>

                  </a>  But the true credit belongs to the member for Dunkley. He got this train moving, and all around Australia the infrastructure train is moving. The coalition is investing $8 billion a year, compared to $6 billion under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. It is a $75 billion infrastructure investment program over a 10-year period. It's all there in black and white, Mr Speaker, in the ABS's <span style="font-style:italic;">Engineering construction activity</span>, a document I know that you personally are very familiar withâ8762.0. For any who may not be familiar with it, the value of public sector transport engineering construction work done in the most recent quarter was $5.9 billion, an all-time high. And where did it stand some 10 years ago, in the first Rudd era? It's now 79.3 per cent higher than during the first Rudd era. The value of public sector transport engineering construction work is $5.9 billion. The Turnbull government has made record spending on infrastructure. That means more jobs for Australians. It means congestion-busting projects all around Australia. It means getting on with the job of delivering outcomes for Australians when it comes to infrastructure.</span>

                </a>  In an interview on ABC Radio National on 6 August, the Minister for the Environment and Energy said that I, when I was environment minister, had failed to invest in the Great Barrier Reef. The facts are these. As agriculture minister, I was part of establishing the Reef Rescue program, worth $200 million from 2007, which then provided a further $200 million when it was renewed. Additionally we established the Coral Sea Marine Park and, most importantly, we were a government that acted on climate change.</span>

The reef has never been put on the 'in danger' list, and the UNESCO World Heritage Committee has never had an endangered watchlist.

On each of these dates, the watchlist continued to not exist, while the credibility of the minister went from endangered to extinct.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Government responses to House committee reports are required within a six month period from the presentation of the report in the House (<span style="font-style:italic;">as per the resolution adopted by the House, 29 September 2010</span>). Government responses to Senate committee reports are required within three months of a report being tabled.1 All Joint Committees adhere to Senate Standing Orders and therefore government responses are required within three months of tabling a report.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This schedule does not list reports that do not require a government response. In the past, the practice was to include all reports tabled in the House in the Speaker's schedule. However, the intent of this schedule is to provide an update to the House on the status of government responses to committee reports.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives unless the reports make recommendations that are wider than the provision of the bill and would therefore be the subject of a government response. The Government's response to bill inquiry reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House. Also not included are reports from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests, and the Publications Committee (other than reports on inquiries). Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are usually reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' regular scrutiny reports on the human rights compatibility of bills and legislative instruments are not listed, as the timeframe for a response is specified in correspondence to the relevant minister. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit primarily make administrative recommendations but may make policy recommendations. A government response is required in respect of such policy recommendations made by the committee. Responses to administrative recommendations are made in the form of an Executive Minute provided to, and subsequently tabled by, the committee. Agencies responding to administrative recommendations are required to provide an Executive Minute within six months of the tabling of a report. Executive Minutes are included in this schedule.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  In continuation regarding this bill today I was commenting about remarks made by the Director of the Department of Addiction Medicine at St Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne in direct relation to impact of this bill. I place on the record again what Associate Professor Yvonne Bonomo said in her remarks regarding this bill. I hope those opposite are listening carefully, because she said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Pushing people to the brink won't make it better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the government has not even announced the cost of this, nor do they know the detail of what types of tests will be conducted. I again ask for the evidence. Where is it? Where is the detail? When considering new trials such as these we can often look to other countries who have implemented similar programs to gauge their success, but on this occasion what we find is not success but rather a track record of this system simply not working. That's what the experts at the Royal Australasian College of Physicians have to say about this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2013, the New Zealand government instituted a drug testing program â¦ among welfare recipients. In 2015, only 22 (0.27 per cent) of 8,001 beneficiaries tested returned a positive result for illicit drug use or refused to be tested. This detection rate was much lower than the proportion of the population estimated to be using illicit drugs in New Zealand â¦ Similar results were found in the United States â¦ In Utah, 838 of the state's 9,552 welfare applicants were screened with 29 returning a positive result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's just 0.3 per cent. These were costly initiatives that simply drove people into poverty and crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has also been the subject of a Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry, which recently handed down its report. This included a statement from Clinical Associate Professor Adrian Reynolds, an expert in addiction medicine, who said that the drug-testing trial is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ unlikely to bring about any sustained changes in patients' drug use behaviours and may even be counterproductive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I hope those opposite are listening. Drug and alcohol addiction experts have said this measure may be counterproductive. Associate Professor Adrian Reynolds went further and told the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ this drug testing trial is clinically inappropriate and not designed in a way that will address the issues of substance dependence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Expert after expert has shared similar views. The report also included the following statement about the cost:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labor Senators on the Committee are concerned that the Government has not revealed details about the cost of the proposed drug testing trial and have serious concerns based on international experiences and the stated cost of testing in Australia, that the drug testing trial will be very expensive to administer and represent poor value for taxpayers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The experts are not coming forward to back the claim of those opposite, who like to cloak themselves in responsibility and responsible behaviour. In fact not one expert has come forward for this. The report went on:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee heard evidence that the funds for treatment to be provided for the Government were insufficient to meet the current need, let alone the increased demand that is expected to be generated by the drug testing trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the committee we also learned that my own home state of Queensland is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ about $75 million short of what would be considered an adequate treatment system to meet the needs of those people who voluntarily want to enter the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ this figure does not take in to account an amount to enable services to meet increased demand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence is simply overwhelmingly against this piece of legislation, but perhaps none more so than the tragic story told to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee by Mr Matthew Noffs, from the Ted Noffs Foundation, about an 18-year-old girl. He says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">She was raped by her father repeatedly since the age of four. She was then forced to become a sex worker at 14. By 16, she was using ice to get by. She is continuing to use ice at 18 and she is on the dole.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is the only thing that is keeping her alive. The drug is the one thing that is keeping her alive. She had broken countless laws by the time she was a teenager. She doesn't care about being arrested for this â¦ She will find any which way that she can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

When the LNP were in state government, they closed centres in my own electorate, like the Barrett Adolescent Centre. Are you going to apologise for that? No, he is saying he is not apologising for that. I say: read the report. The member for Bowman should read the report about the impact of what the Newman administration did about the closing of those centres. Read the report. Take the advice from experts.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the government sitting in the chamber today, I urge them to reconsider their ill-fated stance taken on this important issue and the harm that it will inflict on vulnerable Australians, families and communities. We know that there is not a single piece of evidence that suggests this policy will do anything but cause harm. I'm proud to say that Labor and myself will not be supporting this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MORTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:34</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing Trial) Bill 2018. This bill establishes a two-year trial of drug testing for 5,000 new recipients of Newstart allowance and youth allowance other for illicit substances like ice and ecstasy. The trial is compassionate. It is about making lives better. It is about getting people with drug issues and drug addiction the services and treatment they need to beat their addiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Substance abuse impacts on so many people, not just the drug users themselves. Their families and their friends all experience the heartbreak, the anger, the financial strain and the safety issues that come with someone with a serious drug addiction. One of the worst barriers to a productive life and to getting a job is drug addiction itself. Doing nothing isn't an option. Doing nothing isn't helping Australians to address their drug addiction and to get off welfare and into work. Newstart and youth allowance are designed to help people while they look for work, but, if you are bombed out of your brain on drugs or booze, you can't search for work. Even if you get the interview, you're not going to get the job. That's the sad reality. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's National Drug Strategy Household Survey shows that drug use is higher for unemployed people than those with a job. Quite frankly, you shouldn't need a survey to tell you that. If you are unemployed, you are three times more likely to use ice. People with substance abuse issues deserve government support and intervention to help them get clean, into work and back to a productive life, not just for them but also for their family. The community also has the right to expect that taxpayer-funded welfare is being used by jobseekers to do everything they can to find a jobânot used to fund harmful drug addictions. Compassionate drug testing will identify the people who need help, and the treatment fund will make sure that those people have what they need to get clean and to get job-ready. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The drug testing trial will operate in three locations: Canterbury Bankstown in New South Wales; Logan in Queensland; and Mandurah in my home state of Western Australia. These three communities were carefully chosen, using evidence and data from a number of sources which showed that they were the communities most in need of intervention. This included data from the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission's National Wastewater Drug Monitoring Program, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's National Drug Strategy Household Survey, state and territory crime statistics on drug use and possession, state and territory hospital data and data from the Department of Human Services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Wastewater Drug Monitoring Program gives us concrete data informing drug policy. Wastewater testing estimated the consumption of illicit substances. More than 8.3 tonnes of methamphetamine, three tonnes of cocaine, 1.2 tonnes of MDMA and more than 700 kilograms of heroin were consumed between August 2016 and August 2017. Regionally, methamphetamine and MDMA consumption exceeded capital city consumption. These numbers are alarming. The three trial locations already have strong support services in place, but this government recognises the scale of the issue and has announced, as part of this trial of those 5,000 welfare recipients, a dedicated treatment fund of $10 million for additional treatment services for those affected jobseekers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This support is a really important part of the drug-testing trial. Isn't it amazing how those opposite just do not mention the fact that it isn't just the welfare recipients who will be tested? The support services will also be tested to ensure that they are adequate for those people identified with a drug abuse problem to help them get into a productive life of work. There will be $1 million for case management services for people who test positive more than once under the trial. There will be $3 million to boost drug treatment capacity in the three trial communities, and $6 million for additional accredited treatment support to supplement the state and Commonwealth services that are already in place. This is in addition to the almost $685 million this government has already committed over four years to reduce the impact of drug and alcohol abuse on individuals, families and communities. This includes an investment of almost $300 million as part of the National Ice Action Strategy to improve prevention, treatment care and education to tackle ice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Expert advice from the drug-testing provider and the drug and alcohol treatment sector will also be assessed when developing procedures and safeguards to get the trial right. This considerable investment in the health and wellbeing of our community recognises that, by supporting jobseekers to address their substantial substance abuse issues, it is the most essential step in their becoming productive again, getting a job and getting back into life. Jobseekers themselves, their families, the community and the economy will all benefit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to my good friend the member for Canning. The Mandurah trial location is in his community, and he is committed to tackling drugs and ice in his community. Methamphetamine consumption in regional WA is the highest in Australia. The number of welfare recipients in Western Australia who try to claim drug or alcohol use as an excuse for not meeting their mutual obligations increased by 475 per cent over five years, with 1,075 applications submitted in 2017 alone. The member for Canning's community in Mandurah will benefit greatly from this drug-testing trial, and the Canning community, like mine in Tangney, tell me that they want real action on drugs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before parliament right now is a program that could make a big difference for all of our communities. Some of our colleagues opposite have chosen to speak about the drug-testing trial in isolation, without any mention at all of the other programs and services being delivered as part of this trial. The treatment and support services with this trial are very significant. But let's remember: this is a trial. The drug tests and the support services are being trialled together. If more needs to be done, or if more resources need to be allocated, then this trial will show that. That will be a benefit of this trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be consequences for people who deliberately miss an appointment without a reasonable excuse, or refuse a drug test in order to avoid a possible positive result. Jobseekers who test positive to a drug test will have their payments placed on income management. This restricts their access to cash and limits the jobseeker's ability to use their payments to fund further harmful drug use. There is no reduction in the amount of support they get from the Commonwealth, but there is a change in the way that support from the Commonwealth provided by the taxpayer is applied to them. Jobseekers who test positive will also be subject to a second drug test within 25 working days, and may be subject to further tests. This will identify people who have an ongoing problem and who require that help, that intervention and that treatment. Jobseekers who test positive to more than one drug test will be referred to a medical professional experienced in drug and alcohol treatment, who will assess their individual circumstances, and identify appropriate treatment and support options. If the medical professional recommends treatment, the jobseeker will be required to participate in that treatment. This is an important intervention. Without this, the trial may not happen. This is an intervention that could actually change the course of somebody's life, and the treatment services can form part of their job plan. As I said earlier, there's no point going to job interviews if you have a drug addiction problem. You may as well be supported by this government, get support, and get the treatment services that you need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This trial is not about penalising people or demeaning jobseekers with drug-abuse issues. The trial is about making sure that jobseekers get the support and treatment they need to find a job and to make their life better. I know about the intersection of welfare and drugs from my own family experience. I spoke about that in my maiden speech, and I've spoken about that in other debates on this particular topic. I reflect back on the intersection of drugs and welfare in my own family, and I wonder whether or not, if this drug-testing trial had been in place 20 years ago, some of the outcomes in my own family would be very different today. Do I know they would be different? No, I don't. Do I know they could be different? Yes, I do. And because there is a chance that this intervention can improve the lives of drug users and move them off drug addiction, we need to take that chance, we need to try this trial, and we need to learn from it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Often welfare was 'cash for compensation', simply set and forget. I don't believe at all that our welfare system should be set and forget. I don't believe that our welfare system should be compensation for the circumstances in which someone has found themselves in life. Our welfare system must always be an investment in somebody. That investment has been funded by the Australian taxpayer through the Australian government, and when you're making an investment, you want to make sure that investment is going absolutely to the outcomes you desireâand the outcome we desire isn't a life of drug abuse and addiction; it's a life of productivity and engagement with family and our economy. And you can only do that through engagement through work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm absolutely of the view that this intervention and support will make a big difference to so many lives. The best form of welfare is always a job. More than one million jobs have been created since the coalition government was elected in 2013. The government has reduced welfare dependency for working-age Australians to the lowest level in 25 years. In the three years to June 2017, the number of working-age Australians on income support fell by 140,000, to 2.4 million people. This represents a reduction of around $23 billion in future lifetime costs to the welfare system. This is something that we're very proud of on this side of the House. This is something the government is committed to. This is something that is actually making lives better. I'm in parliament to empower people to take control of their lives, and for the government, where it needs, to co-invest in their future. So, if you're a young person on welfare, you can be an aspirational hardworking Australian. You can apply your effort, get a job and get ahead. And if drugs are an issue, we should be there as a government to have that intervention, to give that individual the intervention they may not ask for but may need in order to get the support that they need to change and turn their life around. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The best thing we can do is to help someone off drugs, off welfare and into work. And we cannot be blinded by ideology like those opposite. We should give the drug-testing trial a chance. I ask and I plead with the opposition and the crossbench to support this important trial. We must support these jobseekers. It's about helping people, and a failure to identify and assist people who have drug-dependency issues will leave them rot in a cycle of lifelong welfare. So we've got to get out into our communities with an open mind. We need to see what people think and get the facts. We need to support this trial and get the learnings from it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The community, in my view, is very supportive of these measures. Millions of Australians are used to accepting drug testing for jobs in mining, construction, transport and many of our large companies. Why should it be any different for someone on welfare? We know that there's a problem in our communities, we know that that problem is exacerbated for those who are on welfare and we know that drug use and welfare do intersect. We know that the lazy application of cash as welfare isn't working. It isn't helping people that need that help. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll always look for the best ways to support people on welfare, particularly where welfare dependency exists alongside the harm of drug and alcohol abuse. This drug-testing trial delivered by this legislation is about helping people get the treatment for their drug issues, to get them off welfare and into a job. It's about making a better life for them and their families, and this parliament should support this trial.</span>

                    <a href="37998" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:47</span>):  At the core of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing Trial) Bill 2018 are the three drug-testing trials which are planned for Canterbury Bankstown in New South Wales, Mandurah in Western Australia and my own community of Logan City in Queensland. This bill is not a genuine or meaningful attempt to help out some of the most vulnerable people in our community. It's all about denigrating, demeaning, diminishing vulnerable people and pushing them to the brink. It's all about chasing a cheap tabloid headline at the expense of community cohesion. And it's all about a government so blinded by ideology that they won't listen to expert after expert after expert in the health field, the law and order field and beyond who say that this won't work and that it will be counterproductive. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a dangerous approach to people on social security payments because it will further marginalise them and it will push them to the brink, and that will have all kinds of consequences not just for the person immediately affected but for communities right around the country. This is a bit personal for me, because I do represent, proudly, the community that I was born in, grew up in, live in and love; I am raising my family there now. I tell you, we are a little bit sick as a community of being singled out by this out-of-touch Prime Minister and the LNP time and time again for this kind of denigration. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are sick and tired of the fake concern shown by those opposite, including in the most recent contributionâthis pretence that they care about vulnerable people. It makes us sick, Deputy Speaker. We are sick and tired of the lectures from Point Piper about what it's like to be on a low or a fixed income and battling with drug addiction. We are sick and tired of being the first port of call every timeâand it's quite frequentâthose opposite need a distraction from the latest scandals, whether it be half a billion dollars going to the Prime Minister's mates or by-election failures and other humiliations. We are sick and tired of being the first port of call when the government needs a distraction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be voting against this legislation, as will every one of my colleagues, because we understand that what's being proposed here won't work, because we've listened to the experts and the experts have said that this will actually lead to worse health outcomes, it will lead to more crime, it will lead to more marginalisation and it will lead to more poverty. I think it speaks ill of those oppositeâit says everything about those oppositeâthat, in the face of overwhelming expert opinion, they are so blinded by their extreme ideology and so keen to chase that cheap headline that they want to persevere with this ridiculous bill anyway. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the first time that these drug-testing proposals have been before the House. They were attached to the broader social services legislation, and they failed then because those on the crossbench, thankfully, listened to the experts, as we did. So they have failed before. This bill is a little bit different in that it actually names the three sitesâthe three sites I mentioned at the outset. The trials were supposed to commence on 1 July this year, and that deadline has obviously been missed. The costs of the trial haven't been published, but the government has announced the money for drug testing. But it isn't clear how the treatment fund will be allocated and if it will be in sufficient time before the trials are scheduled to commence. So we will oppose this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, a whole range of groups right around Australia have come out and pointed out the flaws in the approach proposed by those opposite. Let me just do you a very quick roll call. These are just some of the health experts, medical professionals and community organisations that have opposed the measures that are being proposed here: the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, St Vincent's Health, the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, Harm Reduction Australia, Penington Institute, the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, the Australian Council of Social Service, UnitingCare Australia, Homelessness Australia and the St Vincent de Paul Society. All of these groups are united in their opposition to the government's proposals for these drug trials. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's consider for a moment that the other piece of paper I'm holding contains all of the groups who have come out in support of this legislation: absolutely none. Across the board, no community organisation, no expert group, no peak body in health or law and order has come out in support of what is being proposed here. This is the complete list of the organisations which have come out in support of what the government is proposing! That just shows you the folly of what's being imposed on communities like mine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just consider some of the quotes from some of those organisations. The Director of St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne's Department of Addiction Medicine said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">International experience shows when you push people to the brink, like removing their welfare payments, things just get worse â¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There will be more crime, more family violence, more distress within society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Medical Association said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ the AMA considers these measures to be mean and stigmatising.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre said there was 'no evidence' that any of these measures will directly achieve outcomes associated with reductions in alcohol or other drug use or harms, and indeed have 'the potential to create greater levels of harm, including increased stigma, marginalisation and poverty'. These experts know, as we on this side of the chamber know, that this has been trialled and has failed elsewhere, including in 2013 in New Zealand. In 2015 in New Zealand, only 22 of 8,001 participants returned a positive result. This was a detection rate much lower than the proportion of the general New Zealand population estimated to be using illicit drugs. Similar results came back in trials in the US states of Missouri and Utah.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other very real concerns that testing could encourage people to use less-traceable drugs. There are a whole range of other issues around long waiting lists, meaning that people testing positive might not be able to get the help they need. There are all kinds of issues around Centrelink staff possibly being put at risk of aggression and violence as they attempt to enforce drug testing of participants, and that's before we even get to the fact that those opposite haven't been able to organise anything in the social services space without getting it horribly wrong, whether it's robo-debt or right across the board in ITâthings like the Census, or Medicare information being sold on the dark web. Even if this was a good idea, those opposite wouldn't have the capacity to implement it properly. So, what they're proposing to do is to commit a whole bunch of money to something that won't work, hasn't worked overseas, won't work here, would be counterproductive and is not supported by any of the expertsâwhich is a pretty remarkable situation that they've found themselves in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the national peak organisations, in my community of Logan City, to the south of Brisbane, there has been a fierce local reaction to what's being proposed here. And I commend the local council; I commend Acting Mayor Cherie Dalley and all her colleagues for the way they've gone about this, and all the community groups. They weren't even given the courtesy of being notified that they'd been singled out for these trials. They found out about it when they read about it in the newspaper, which is a pretty appalling way to treat a community in which you'd like to implement your drug trial. If you think about some of the most respected people in our community, they have come out fiercely in opposition to what's being proposed. For example, Cath Bartolo, the CEO of YFSâa terrific group in my electorate that helps disadvantaged and vulnerable peopleâhas described the measure as 'punitive and not backed by evidence'. Here is Cath on the front page of our local paper last year. The story says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A Logan-based social services group has slammed last week's federal government decision to test welfare recipients in Logan for drugs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cath Bartolo also came to a Senate committee hearing in Logan about the proposed legislation. There she said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For young people, I'm really worried if they lose income and are not linked to positive things about trying to get employment they'll turn to crime or other means, like prostitution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These fears are shared pretty broadly in our community. Julie Fursey, from LECNA, the Logan East Community Neighbourhood Association, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We see this as a discriminatory policy. It's going to discriminate against the most vulnerable people in the community. It's going to really hurt Logan City. We'll be looking at increased crime, increased domestic violence and robberies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Geoffrey Davey, of the Queensland Injectors Health Network, said to the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It may actually have the effect of increasing socialisation, stigma, discrimination and marginalisation of what is already a very vulnerable population.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rebecca Lang, of the Queensland Network of Alcohol and Other Drug Agencies, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There will be a proportion of people who will move into activities that maybe previously they wouldn't have thought about doing, like sex work or crime, usually property crime, to get things that they can pawn or sell to buy drugs or swap with their dealer to get drugs. The reality is that people who are experiencing drug dependence live fairly grim lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The list goes on and on. People have come out against this. The acting mayor of Logan City, Cherie Dalley, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the light of concerns raised by the medical community, the lack of consultation and the lack of evidence about the effectiveness of similar measures internationally, Council believes there is further work to be done in order to be able to proceed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Logan City also has very serious concerns about how we as a community have been selected for this drug trial. The member for Tangney in his contribution talked about the testing of the local sewage to determine which communities were picked. He may not appreciateâand I mean this respectfullyâthat the testing done to pick my community in Logan City was actually done on the Brisbane sewerage plants to which many communities, many councils, feed into. So there have been errors in that part of the selecting of the site. The relevant council officer, Nick McGuire, Acting Director of Community Services, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                    <span style="background-color:#FFFFFF;" />
                    <span style="background-color:#FFFFFF;">It became apparent that the data was really about the convenience of choosing a location like Logan rather than the data actually putting together a strong business case for Logan being one of the locations.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The data doesn't really stack up from a Logan-specific purpose: it points to some wastewater treatment reports that are really targeting towards Brisbane and it points to the Logan district police service district, which is really not the entirety of Logan either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are a whole range of flaws with how we've arrived at this absurd proposition not just as it relates to my community but as it relates to all three of the communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend Senators Lisa Singh, Murray Watt and Louise Pratt, because they have done an excellent job highlighting the problems with these trials in their dissenting report to the Senate committee report. They pointed to a lot of the issues that I've talked about in some detail so far.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the government is unable to tell the Australian people how much these trials will cost taxpayers, which is a pretty reckless approach when you consider we've got record debt in this country. It's pretty amazing that they won't fess up about what they're spending on the ideologically-driven proposals that we're debating today. The reason they can't tell us how much it costs is that they don't know what tests will be used. They don't know a whole range of things. There is a whole range of unanswered questions, including the cost of these tests. We're not going to give the government a blank cheque to demonise jobseekers in my community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For all those reasons, Labor opposes this bill and the drug testing that it seeks to implement. We have listened to the experts, we have consulted with the communities and we genuinely care about helping people who need help. We don't want to see more of the punishing of those people, more of the demeaning and demonising of them that we've seen from those opposite. We're up for a genuine discussion about how we help people battling addiction, how we help ensure they receive the treatment they need and how we stop kicking people in the guts when they're down, which is at the core of what the government is proposing in this legislation which should not be supported.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="260805" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing Trial) Bill 2018 is sensible, practical and popular legislation. It's a popular idea in Mandurah, the city in my electorate that will be one of the three trial sites and fits with the broader action that this government has taken to tackle drug abuse in our region. There is no reasonâno good reasonâwhy this parliament should not pass it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the drug testing trial? The drug test trial will apply to new recipients of Centrelink's Newstart and youth allowance payments. Both of these payments are for people either preparing for work through study and training or trying to get a job. Under the trial, a person receiving Newstart or youth allowance may be randomly asked to take a confidential drug test. If they pass, nothing happens. If they test positive, their payments are in income management for 24 months. Income management is used by Centrelink to limit the amount of money from a recipient's payment that can be withdrawn in cash. In the case of the drug test trial, 80 per cent of that benefit would be put on income management. It would still be accessible for the essentials like rent, child care, school uniforms and the like but unable to be spent as cash on illicit drugs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to understand that no money is taken away from the person who takes the test. They will still receive their payment; it's just not all provided in cash. Twenty-five days after their first test, a recipient who tests positive is required to take a second test. If the results are negative then they proceed through the rest of their 24 months on income management with no further action. If they test positive then they're referred to a medical professional who assesses them to develop a personalised treatment plan. That treatment plan could include rehab or counselling, and Centrelink will work with them to ensure that they get the help that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is immensely practical legislation. If a person is on Centrelink and looking for work but at the same time struggling with substance abuse, they are clearly going to have a difficult time finding and then holding a job. Drug addiction is a huge barrier to long-term employment. Many jobs today require regular drug tests. I was tested in my previous career, alongside many others, in the ADF. Drug testing is common in the mining industry, one of the biggest employers in WA. Even the City of Mandurah, who has opposed this trial, drug tests its employees. So if a jobseeker can't pass a drug test then they're going to find it very difficult to get a job and hold that job, and helping people to get a job is the entire point of Newstart and youth allowance. So rather than letting these people be forgotten in the system, potentially for years with no change, the drug-testing trial identifies people early and gets them help that they need so they can become drug-free and job ready. This is about a new start for people, helping them on the road to recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How will the drug-testing trial impact Mandurah? As the representative for one of the trial sites, I've obviously had a lot of feedback from the local community about the plan. The feedback I've received is overwhelmingly positive. People intuitively see the sense in this plan. Many have already randomly tested themselves at work and can't see the controversy. Others are actually surprised that this doesn't happen already. The fact is that the people of Mandurah know that drug use is an issue in our community. They've been telling me that they want action on it since I was elected in 2015, and that's what I've been doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard some in this place argue that what's really needed is better local drug support services and more job opportunities to tackle unemployment. These people say that the government should focus on these issues rather than the drug-testing trial. These are lazy arguments and cheap politics. These people haven't bothered to look at what the government is already doing on the ground in Mandurah. The fact is we are already acting to provide better drug and health services and to tackle unemployment. Since 2015 I've campaigned against drug abuse in Mandurah and the Peel region. Working with local government, community groups and healthcare providers, we focused on services that achieve prevention and early intervention, and we have had success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016, the federal government delivered $2 million for the construction of the Peel Youth Medical Service health hub, thanks to the combined advocacy of a lot of other community groups. The state government also committed funding in 2017, and that has ensured that our plan would become a reality. The health hub is currently being built in Mandurah. Once completed, it will provide a one-stop shop for young people in the Peel region struggling with physical and mental health issues. Inside the health hub will be the Peel region's first ever headspace, approved and funded by this government. This project is endorsed by the local council, Mandurah locals and healthcare professionals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government has also funded the Mandurah local drug action team, as part of the National Ice Action Strategy. The Mandurah drug action team is working with its Communities That Care partners to educate local parents and students about the dangers of alcohol abuse. So, contrary to the claims of the opposition, the government is expanding providing health in Mandurah and taking positive action to tackle substance abuse in the Peel region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've done a lot to boost local employment as well. Last year Mandurah was identified as one of five key regional areas that would have access to the federal government's $10.3 million Stronger Transitions package. Under this program, workers facing retrenchment are given assistance transitioning into their next job. The Stronger Transitions program provides funding for training and supporting, relocation options and access to small business opportunities. The point is to prevent retrenched workers falling through the cracks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's not all. The government has also spent record amounts on infrastructure investment in our region. $581 million will be spent by this government to extend the Tonkin Highway south into the heart of the Peel region. This is going to create thousands of new jobs and foster the expansion and development of local industry. There will be more jobs in the Peel region thanks to the Tonkin Highway extension funded by the coalition. We're also funding the creation of a new train station in Lakelands which will improve access to jobs further north in Perth, particularly for young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should also be said that in Mandurah the unemployment rate has fallen from 11.6 per cent to 6.5 per cent in 2017 thanks, in no small part, to this government's pro-small-business policies. So it's just lazy to suggest that the government should focus on drug services and unemployment rather than the drug-testing trial. We can do more than one thing at once, and indeed we have the record to prove it. In fact, the drug-testing trial will actually deliver additional funding for local drug and rehab services. The program also includes $10 million to boost drug-treatment capacity and treatment support in the three trial sites, of which Mandurah is one. This is to make sure that the people who test positive under the trial have access to adequate support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the more common objections that people have made about the drug-testing trial is to suggest that politicians should be drug tested too and that we should be setting the standard. After all, if it's good enough for Centrelink, why not members of parliament and senators as well? I understand the sentiment. Recently, I met with Brian Lloyd of Drug-Safe Workplaces Western Australia. Drug-Safe Workplaces collaborates with workplace leaders, staff and unions to implement drug and alcohol testing that is safe and comfortable for all parties involved. Brian believes that drug testing should not be punitive and that it should be pre-emptive. By identifying early when someone has encountered substance abuse, we can act and help them before things get out of hand. After speaking with Brian, and in light of some of the feedback I've received from the community, it seemed appropriate to lead by example. So on 3 September, I've organised for Brian to do a drug test of my office. My team and I will undergo the same test proposed by this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For Mandurah, the drug-testing trial is part of a multipronged approach to local drug abuse. We're improving health services, expanding job opportunities and, with this program, identifying and coming alongside the people who need help. The drug-testing trial helps Centrelink, Newstart and Youth Allowance programs effectively achieve what they're designed to do. It provides further funding for drug treatment services, and, crucially, it helps keep taxpayers' money out of the hands of drug dealers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, let's remember that this program is a trial. The government is trying something new in a further attempt to help some of the most vulnerable people in our society. Shouldn't we just give it a go? The drug-testing trial is a sensible, practical and popular policy. The people of Mandurah support the plan and want this parliament to pass it as soon as possible. Labor will have to answer to the Mandurah community if they continue to block the peoples' will.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  What do you do if you're a government who's in trouble in the polls? What do you do if you're on the way out, you've been caught out looking after your big corporate mates at the expense of everyone else and you're pressing ahead saying, 'Let's give tens of billions of dollars worth of tax cuts to the big banks at the same time as they're being hauled before the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry and potentially facing criminal actions'? What do you do if you're a government who's sitting watching pollution go up at a time when we have a record heatwave in the Northern Hemisphere and everyone's telling us we need to make sure that we don't leave a planet and an Australia for our kids that are worse than the ones that we inherited? What do you do if you're a government under whose watch youth unemployment and underemployment have reached crisis levels so that we're at the point now where just on one in three young people in this country either hasn't got a job or hasn't got enough hours of work? What do you do if you're this Liberal government? You find someone else to go and beat up onâpreferably someone who isn't going to be in a position to defend themselves. If you're this Liberal government, you don't go after the crooks in the corporations, you don't go after the big banks and you don't go after the big pollutersâyou go after the people who are doing it tough and who are trying to find a job and can't get one. And you blame those people, if you're the Liberals, for not finding jobs that just aren't there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this bill, they've decided that the way they can hopefully get a bit of an uptick in the pollsâand perhaps get some votes back from right-wing parties that they're leaking votes toâis by treating everyone who's on welfare as a potential criminal. If you are on welfare, if you are looking for a jobâyou might have lost a job, through no fault of your own, or you might be one of those one in three young people who can't find a job or can't find enough hours of work because, since the GFC, youth un- and underemployment in this country has got worse, not betterâwell, what's the answer? We're going to treat you as a potential criminal and give the right for government to force you to have compulsory drug tests. You are a person who's suspected to have broken the law through having done nothing more than being in receipt of welfare, and we are going to take away your rightsâthat's what the government is saying to people in this country who are doing it toughâwe're going to call you a potential criminal and we're going to take your rights away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't lift people out of poverty by taking away their rights. You don't solve youth unemployment and underemployment in this country by blaming the victims for not finding jobs that aren't there because this government has other priorities. If you take those steps that the government is proposing in this bill, you actually make the problem worse. The government might as well rename this bill the increasing-crime bill, because that is what is going to happen. Once you say to people that if you have taken drugs and you don't follow some other steps that the government's now imposing on you then we're going to take away your money, then you force people further into poverty. If you say to people, 'We are going to take away your money,' that does nothing to diminish addiction. What it does is push people further and further away from the government system, including potential government systems of support, and it will increase crime.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know how much time this government has spent dealing with people on the front line of drug addiction services, but what these services will tell youâand there are quite a few very good ones in my electorateâis that when someone is truly an addict they will start doing things that you wouldn't expect of that person when they were not subject to addiction. Addiction is like a disease. It forces you to do things just to maintain the addiction. So if you say to someone, 'You're going to have to do X, Y and Z, because we've subjected you to a drug test, you've come back with a positive result and you haven't complied with these other steps, and we're now going to cut your payments'âif someone is in that situation, where they are that in thrall to a drug, then there is every chance that they're not going to respond to it in a rational manner, as a rational, calculating, economic individual might do. They're going to make decisions driven by the addiction. As a result, this government is going to say to them, 'Well, no money for you.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do you think someone who is in the grip of an addiction, who now no longer has any money because the government is taking it away from them, is going to do? They are going to turn to crime to get themselves the money for the next fix. That is what the agencies in my electorate are telling me. That is what the health professionals are saying. But this government does not listen, because this is all about the politics for this government. This is all about trying to get the attention away from the fact that they're doing nothing to create meaningful employment for young people in this country. They're doing everything to give money to the big banks and the big corporations, and they're on the nose because of it. So, what do you do? Well, you try to blame someone else in order to shift the conversation. That is what this government is doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been very worried for some time about the income management proposals that lie at the heart of this billâwhich says that because you're someone who's doing it tough, because you're someone who's vulnerable, we're going to take your money and tell you how best to spend it in ways that we wouldn't ever dream of doing for anyone else; we're going to treat you as a second-class citizen and take away your money. We have said from the beginning that when those proposals were first introducedâand they've been trialled and pushed down the throats of Indigenous Australians in this countryâlook out, because not only is it a bad idea for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders but it's a bad idea for everyone. Once the government says, 'We are now in a position to be able to dictate to you how you spend your money, and if you don't do it the way we like or you don't comply with the conditions that we put on you, we're going to take away your incomeâand force you to have a card, with the stigma of having to go to the shops with a card to particular shops, where they can dictate their own prices. Because you've now got one of these government-marked cardsâor worse; you might have no income at allâand, once the government starts going down this road, it is going to expand to the broader population. We have said that from the beginning, and now we are seeing it in practice. Someone who has done nothing more than fall prey to addiction, who deserves our help to get out of that, and who deserves to have their situation treated as a health issue, will now not only be treated as a potential criminal but potentially find themselves in an even worse situation than they were in to start withâthanks to this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many things the government could do if it was serious about addressing the root causes of drug addiction. It could stop cutting funding to agencies. It could start with serious programs to tackle our youth unemployment and underemployment crisis in this countryâand I'll come back to that, because that is absolutely crucial. Since the GFC, it has become harder for young people to find work, and the work that they find is very often part-time and, as a resultâas I said beforeâone in three young people either hasn't got a job or hasn't got enough work. This is a national crisis. That is what we should be focusing on. What government programs can we put in place to create employment? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why can't the government spend some of the $50 billion that it wants to spend on corporate tax cuts on building new houses for the homeless instead? That could employ some of the young people in apprenticeships, so that they could learn a trade and we could solve a social problem, all at once. That's a better way of spending the money than giving it to the big banks for a tax cut. Why don't we use some of the money that's about to go to the big banks for a tax cut to build new renewable energy in this country, like government authorities used to do in the states? And again, we'll create some apprenticeships on those, so that young people can get new jobs as apprentice electricians and get apprentice trade work. Why don't we do something about the fact that the mining boom decimated manufacturing in this country, and give some tax breaks to industry so that they can put it into building new manufacturing capacity and tie it to job creation? So instead of a big handout, we say: 'You only get support from the government if you're going to give people new jobs.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've done in this country since the GFC, including under this government's watch, is scrap all of the entry-level jobs that people who finished year 10 or year 12 used to walk into. We've made it more expensive to go off and get a trade or get a degree and, as a result, we now have hundreds of thousands of young people whoâat the momentâhave never known a steady, full-time, permanent job, and who may never know one in the future. What should we do with them? Let's get them engaged. Let's get government back to some of the things that government is meant to be about. But instead, all this government does is run around with a big stick and say: 'It's that person's fault if they can't find a job.' And if, because they can't find a job, they've found themselves with more time on their hands than they otherwise might have and they've fallen into addiction: 'Well, we're going to punish them for it by cutting them off even further from the system.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing is, probably everyone in this placeâprobably most people in the countryâknow someone in their family or in their street or in their workplace who's had a son or a daughter who has fallen prey to addiction. What you want in that situation is to know that everyone has that person's welfare at heart, first and foremost. You want to know that that person is not being treated as a political football and you want to know that the services are there to help those people get healthy again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think if it were anyone in this chamber's son or daughter who was addicted, was struggling to deal with it and needed assistance, if they knew that what the government was going to do was say to that person, 'You no longer have any money to live on. That's the sum total of our contribution to you. We are taking away your income', we would be horrified. If, as a result of this government, a person with drug addiction now can't pay the rent then they're going to become homeless. If, as a result of this government, a person with a drug addiction doesn't have any money at all to meet the bare necessities of life, let alone meet their next fix, then they're going to turn to crime and it will be on this government's shoulders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the basest political reasons, this government has taken the sons and daughters of Australia who have fallen on hard times and is making their lot even worse, all because they're struggling in the polls and don't have a positive agenda to sell. We will stand up to it. We've stood up to income management from the beginning. We'll continue to stand up to it now. We've stood up against demonising people who have issues with drugs, and we will continue to stand up to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just like the previous time that the government tried to get this through and got knocked back by the Senate, I hope that this gets rejected by the parliament again, because there is a reason you can find next to no-one lining up with the government to support this. A whole string of people, who work in this field and who look after people who are doing it tough, are lining up to say, 'This is a very bad idea' and they are ringing the warning bells very loudly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that when it comes back to the Senate it gets rejected soundly again, because this is a bad idea that will hurt people. I hope beyond hope that someone I know and care about is never in the situation where, because of this government, they can't deal with the demons that they're facing and, in fact, this government turns around and makes their problem worse. I ask everyone to think if it were your own son or daughter, who was facing these issues, would you really want them to be forced to live with no money at all just because the government wanted to make a political point?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  I understand what the member for Melbourne is saying. He is saying that, if this policy were to remove income from people, the result might be that they would find themselves homeless because they cannot afford rent and that they might turn to crime because they cannot afford the basics of life. So it is my hope that the Greens would reconsider their opposition to this bill on the basis that we will not be removing income from a single person. No person will not be able to afford rent, because they will not have income removed from them. No person will need to turn to a life of crime because they will have income removed, because no person will have their income removed.</span>

                    </a>  I would hope that the member for Melbourne would spend less time interrupting and more time listening. Perhaps he and his party would find it possible, find it in their hearts and find the compassion that is necessary to help people who are trying to make a better life for themselves, instead of walking from the chamber and sticking their heads in the sand when people are crying out for help. Is that the Greens' way?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He asked the question: what if your son or your daughter found themselves in the horrible position where they couldn't get away from the scourge of drugs, where they had become addicted to a substance that was destroying their lives? Let me answer that question on behalf of every member of the Liberal and National Party in this place: we would want a compassionate government to help; not to be driven by ideology and, when confronted with facts, not to run from the chamber, as he has done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need the Greens, we need all members of parliament, to support a policy that speaks of compassion and that seeks to help all Australians, especially vulnerable Australians. Drug abuse is an issue that affects all aspects of the life of a user. It cripples relationships and families. It damages mental and physical health, whilst directly impacting an individual's finances and, importantly, job prospects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Substance abuse is undoubtedly a problem that is indiscriminate, suffered by Australians of all backgrounds. However, it cannot be denied that the prevalence of drug abuse amongst those out of work and receiving welfare payments is a particularly concerning issue, with studies showing that such Australians are three times more likely to have recently used illicit drugs than those with a job. In these cases, not only is drug abuse perpetuating the cycle of unemployment and dependency on welfare but you, the taxpayer, are also subsidising it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While this government is certainly opposed to taxpayers indirectly funding drug dealers and the black market economy, addressing this is not the primary focus of this bill. In fact, it's not the focus of this bill at all. This bill is about saving lives, not saving money. This government will not stand by and continue to allow Australians with drug and alcohol addictions to suffer in silence. Welfare is supposed to be a hand-up, not a handout, and most certainly it's not intended to fund actions that hurt the very people we are supposed to be helping.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The trial of drug tests for welfare recipients proposed by this government is only one step in addressing this scourge, breaking the cycle of addiction and abuse for drug users. If a positive externality of that ensures taxpayer funds are no longer being wasted on such detrimental drugs, no doubt the Greens would oppose it. If we could stand here and say it's going to cost more, that would ensure the support of the Greens. Well, I'm here to say it will actually cost more, because this government is willing to invest and spend to help those who need our help. We want to make it clear that we are not punishing those suffering from substance abuse; we are helping them. By taking away their ability to purchase the very drugs which have ruined and continue to ruin their lives, their families' lives and their friends' lives, we are making a difference. That is what true compassion looks like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Opposing this bill is, quite frankly, confounding, because by opposing it the Greens are permitting people to continue habits which are making their lives worse. We are not going to stand by and allow vulnerable Australians to be victimised by criminal drug dealers. We recognise the need for support and rehabilitation, and it will continue to be available, and we will continue to encourage those who need it to use it. What we are doing, however, is ensuring that those who return positive results for illicit substances no longer have the means to keep buying. Through tried and tested programs such as income management, we can make sure that the majority of welfare payments made to such an individual are spent on necessities rather than harmful drugs. In this way, we can not only ensure taxpayer money is spent appropriately but also cultivate positive attitudes that encourage wiser spending and remove all obstacles and hindrances to finding work. After all, research shows the best form of welfare is a job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobseekers on Newstart and youth allowance will not be required to pass a drug test in order to commence their welfare payments. When making a claim for a payment, jobseekers will simply have to acknowledge that they may be subject to drug testing as part of their ongoing payments. Those who do test positive, of course, just as with an RBT on the roads, will be given an opportunity to request a second test. All drug tests will be conducted by qualified third-party drug testing providers in accordance with normal drug testing standards. Pre-test interviews between the drug tester and the jobseeker are mandatory in order to identify any factors which may interfere with the test, be they prescribed medication or any other factors. If a jobseeker receives a positive drug test, they will continue to receive the same payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be clear: no-one loses money from this. No-one will be thrown onto the street or suddenly lose their financial support, as those in the Greens will have you believe. That is not what this bill is about. We are not trying to punish drug users. Rather, we are helping them break the cycle of addiction. Jobseekers whose test positive to a drug test will be placed on the proven income management program. Income management does not alter the amount the jobseeker receives. The jobseeker's ability to look after themselves and continue to search for a job does not change. Only the way they receive their payments will change. A jobseeker on income management will have 80 per cent of their payment restricted to paying their bills and purchasing essential items. The remaining 20 per cent of the payment is paid into their regular bank account and is accessible to pay for discretionary items. Those who are placed on income management will still be able to make purchases at approved merchants. The only discretionary items which they will not be able to buy are alcohol, smoking products and cash-equivalent products like gift cards, as well as not being able to withdraw cash itself. As well as this, income management will restrict people from spending on any form of gambling, because this is about saving lives and helping people get their lives back on track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Income management and the cashless debit card both have the same end goal of saving people from the scourge of drug and alcohol addiction but go about it in different ways. Income management provides a more tailored approach to welfare management, as opposed to the cashless debit card, which is a community-wide program providing less individualised support for the participant. Income management is designed only for those who truly need our help and support, those burdened with the scourge of drug and alcohol abuse, those who will not be unaffected by this trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill includes a measure to introduce a two-year trial of illicit drug testing of 5,000 randomly selected recipients of Newstart and youth allowance in three specifically selected local government areas across the country. These areas are Canterbury Bankstown in New South Wales, Logan in Queensland and Mandurah in Western Australia. These areas were chosen after a thorough selection process by this government identified them as key problem areas for drug abuse by welfare recipients. In doing so, we can ensure the trial is conducted efficiently, responsibly and in the areas that need it most. These drug tests will test for ice, ecstasy and marijuana as well as opioids. These drugs are a vicious trap which ruins lives, limiting a person's ability to find a job and their capacity to lead a happy and healthy life, fulfilling their full potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Highlighting the gravity of the issue and its impact on the community is that, in 2017 alone, there were 4,856 occasions when a jobseeker named drug or alcohol addiction as the reason for not being able to maintain their job. That's nearly 5,000 people who would be productive members of the Australian workforce if it were not for the terrible affliction of substance abuse. Throughout the trial, there will be a comprehensive evaluation of impacts and outcomes for jobseekers. The benefit of holding these evaluations throughout the trial compared to after is so that any unintended consequences can be handled as they arise. The results of these trials will advise any future extensions as well as any potential rolling out of the drug-testing program more broadly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am committed to helping those in need, including in my own electorate of Mackellar. I would welcome and encourage a drug-testing trial to take place in the local government area of the Northern Beaches without hesitation. I say this because I know that, like me, the people of Mackellar and the Northern Beaches truly care about everyone in their community, in our community, especially those trying to get back on their feet. We are committed to reducing the impact of drug and alcohol abuse on our community's most vulnerable, not only preventing its continuation whilst out of a job, but ideally creating and reinforcing positive habits that will assist struggling Australians when they are working again, preventing any relapse into drug abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To further support those who are struggling with drug and alcohol addiction, the government is providing nearly $10 million to the creation of a dedicated treatment fund. This fund will provide support where the current Commonwealth, state and territory government support services are not sufficient. It will ensure the government is able to supply additional support services to the areas of the trial which are not meeting the additional demand for drug and alcohol support. This is, of course, on top of the $689 million the government has already committed to reducing the impact of drug and alcohol abuse on communities, families and, of course, the individual. This includes a near $300 million investment as part of the National Ice Action Strategy aimed at improving treatment, after-care, education, prevention, assistance and community engagement to tackle ice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Illicit drug and alcohol abuse is a problem which affects many Australians across all different socioeconomic backgrounds, but it is most prevalent among the unemployed. These trials and the measures in this bill will save lives by getting people out of their addiction and back to work. Drug dealers will no longer be subsidised with taxpayers' money, and people who truly need treatment will get it. No-oneâI repeat, no-oneâwhether they test positive or negative, will have their payments reduced at any time. This bill is a magnificent initiative of a government that cares about people, that wants to help people stop harming themselves and give them the skills to help them live their lives to the full. We're not passing a value judgement on those Australians who are out of work and struggling with drug abuse. We are simply ensuring that such detrimental activities are discouraged and that the Australian taxpayer no longer carries the burden of financing them. I support the trials, and I would support them being held in my own electorate of Mackellar. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  Governments should not be wilful. They shouldn't be arbitrary, they shouldn't be cruel and they shouldn't be petty. Rarely should a government mandate procedures that are physically invasive or otherwise intrude disproportionately on the person or the rights of the individual. Nevertheless, we have before us today, not for the first time, a proposal that in ways large and small offends those principles. I do not want a drug-testing trial in my electorate to demonise those already most disadvantaged. Despite our many differences, I'd hope that the Turnbull government might be better than this legislation, but it's not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing Trial) Bill 2018 establishes a two-year drug-testing trial for 5,000 new recipients of Newstart and youth allowance. 'Participants' in the trial will be selected at random and those refusing to be tested will have their welfare payments cancelled immediately. This is the sort of measure that often has government members opposite salivating or expressing lots of righteous indignation which even they know isn't going to make much practical difference. The leisurely pace for passage through the parliament would seem proof of that. It's also an issue that, in my world, defies simplistic explanations. The scourge of drug addiction is not just a simple problem; it's a complex issue with many causes. It is primarily a medical problem. Newstart and youth allowance recipients who test positive to a first drug test will be placed on so-called income support measures for two years and will also be subjected to another test within 25 days. Being placed on income support, in effect, means that only 20 per cent of a recipient's welfare payments are paid in cash and the rest is only available via the government's BasicsCard. Those who fail the second test or test positive again during the two-year income management period will be referred for possible medical treatment, and that treatment, if recommended, will form part of the recipient's job plan. In my electorate, those resources certainly are not available. There's sometimes a wait for rehabilitation that measures years rather than months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government says that the trial will address what it says is the link between drug abuse and unemployment, so that taxpayer-funded welfare payments are not being used to fund drug addiction and so that jobseekers do all they can to find a job. This is another demonstration that the government does not understand drug addiction as a medical problem. For good measure the government has lobbed in some decidedly very iffy claims that the bill is in line with community expectations. Just ask people who are involved in drug rehabilitation what they think about the bill, and they will tell you that this is not the right way to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister concluded his second reading speech by challenging the opposition and the crossbenchers to be brave enough to change their minds and support the trialâanother demonstration of the lack of understanding of drug addiction itself. With the greatest respect, Minister, you should stop being tendentious and stick to the facts. No-one in this place wants to stand in the way of effective and affordable measures that will tackle drug abuseâleast of all those of us who have spent a lifetime dealing with real-life medical issues and emergencies sometimes exacerbated by the abuse of illegal and legal drugs. No-one wants to see welfare payments used to fund drug addiction or fatten the pockets of drug dealers, but this is a very simplistic treatment for a very complex issue. It should go without saying that no-one has a closed mind to new or imaginative solutions that have a decent prospect of making a difference, yet none of the experts tell us that this will make a difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What Labor and the many critics of this bill, both in the medical profession and in the community, want is for drug-related problems to be treated as a health issue and not as yet another way of disciplining the undeserving poor, which those on the government benches seem to think is the way to go, nor as a political bromide to placate its own populist rump. The proposed mandatory drug trial was first hinted at in the Treasurer's 2018 budget speech. It had been bobbling around on the edges of loony-right politics for many years before that. I can remember proposals from the hard Right some years ago about what we should be doing to people with drug addiction. It has fallen in and out of view on the right wing as similar trials were pushed overseas only to be found both costly and of very little value except when narrowly applied within the criminal justice system. Even in such controlled environments the outcomes were often limited or ambiguous. Such has been this government's faltering commitment to its own proposal that the Treasurer has now presented in the 2018 budget, and the drug-testing trial is little further advanced than it was 12 months ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Drug-testing formed part of the government's Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 but was dropped from that bill in December 2017 on the government's own motion. This bill was presented to the House in February this year by the Minister for Social Services, and its contents were immediately referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, which reported back on 7 May. Unlike the mandatory drug-testing trial proposed in the earlier welfare reform bill, this measure at least manages to identify the three local government areas where the trial will be conducted. It also stipulates that a person who fails a drug test would not be subject to the income management strictures of the bill if, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Department of Social Services, that would pose a serious risk to the person's mental, physical or emotional wellbeing. Who makes that judgement? Suffice it to say that all three local governments who were selected to host the trials have been critical of the Commonwealth's proposal in many varying degrees, and all have pointed to a total lack of prior consultation by the minister. While the newly minted legislative requirement that the Secretary of the Department of Social Services not place those at special risk on income management may open up some decisions to judicial review, that provision nonetheless leaves those who lose their allowance with the burden of demonstrating they are a special case, further demonising, stressing and punishing them for a medical problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has failed to address the two substantive concerns raised by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee regarding the proposed measuresâthat matters which ought to have been dealt with by the bill would be left to delegated legislation, and that contractors and not accountable government officials would determine who could be placed on income management arrangements under the scheme. Sadly it is not just the criticisms of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee that the government has largely chosen to ignore. The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights has voiced criticisms too, though largely to no avail. Government senators on the Community Affairs Committee note that the present bill interferes with and limits the rights to privacy, bodily integrity, social security, equality and nondiscrimination. I think the government members should really think about this. The government's own senators even go on to note:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ the Australian Human Rights Commission endorsed the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' analysis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To their credit, the government senators on the Senate committee recommended that the government 'establish and publish the evaluation strategy of the drug testing trial prior to the commencement of the trial' and that the government also 'publish the outcomes of the drug testing trial after it has been completed'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In August this year, the former minister, the current Attorney-General, claimed that there was lots of evidence that suggests that behavioural change can grow around drug-testing regimes. When challenged to provide that evidence, his office referred to six reports and studies. Four of those related to mandatory drug treatment of offenders inside criminal justice systems. Those results are not directly relevant to the proposed trial. The other two reports actually counselled against the drug testing of welfare recipients. So even the previous minister has got it all wrong when it comes to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Drug testing trials in Canada, the United States and New Zealand have all come up empty. This is not backed by evidence, yet again the government wants to punish the most vulnerable. Expert submissions to the Senate inquiry into welfare reform were scathing of drug testing, pointing out that there was no local or overseas evidence to suggest that mandatory testing will induce unemployed drug users to find treatment or to find work. We know that the only systems that work are those that are voluntary and that enable people to submit themselves to drug rehabilitation of their own volition. Once again, the government have not only failed to listen to the experts but failed to understand the science. They have failed to see drug addiction as a medical problem. They continue to use really discriminatory ways of dealing with what are societal and health problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One might be tempted to ask whether the proposed Australian trial is simply unique, because no other country has been silly enough to contemplate such an approach. Helpful community organisations have not come out in favour of the government's proposal, and organisations such as my own Royal Australasian College of Physicians have come out against the trial. Other organisations like ACOSS, the Uniting Church, St Vincent's Health, Anglicare and the National Drug Research Institute oppose it, yet again this government has failed to listen to the experts and to understand the science. Professor Adrian Reynolds, the President of the Australasian Chapter of Addiction Medicine from the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, summed up the position rather nicely, noting:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ the Chapter of Addiction Medicine are quite honestly at a loss to see why a drug testing trial is considered a necessary or effective way to address these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Concerns extend to whether the trial process will add to existing queues for remedial drug treatment and therapy across the country, meaning that those who are voluntarily seeking help will be turned away or have to wait longer for help. The situation is already critical. There are long waits for rehabilitation, even for those who want to voluntarily undergo rehabilitation. Professor Alison Ritter, the Director of the Drug Policy Modelling Program at the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, told the first Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry that Australia currently treats about 200,000 people for substance abuse each year but an additional 200,000 to 500,000 people each year would like to receive treatment which is unavailable to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite repeated questioning at estimates hearings in 2017 and March 2018, the government remained unable or unwilling to identify even a ballpark figure for the cost of the trial; say which illicit drugs will be covered by the trial and why alcohol and legally prescribed opiates will not be part of the trial; specify benchmarks for determining what would make the trial enough of a success to warrant an extension; and provide a rational explanation as to why particular trial sites were preferred to others. Given this sorry history, it is entirely unremarkable that the evidence to the recently completed Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry only reinforced the criticisms detailed previously. For me, one witness observation from the latest Community Affairs Legislation Committee report sums up the Orwellian world being proposed by this government rather neatly:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ the treatment sector has been chronically underfunded for a number of years now â¦ I would be very surprised if you didn't find that a number of the folks who test positive and who are indicated for treatment hadn't, in fact, tried to access the treatment system voluntarily in the past and were turned away, or discouraged by long wait lists or a lack of access.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is remarkable is that the government senators could somehow have managed to support the passage of this bill notwithstanding the criticisms contained or alluded to in their own report. The government senators confirmed that the only evidence that such trials may work comes from inside the highly controlled environment of the criminal justice system, noted the singular lack of success of overseas trials, confirmed that an evaluation strategy has not been developed and acknowledged but failed to address fully the human rights and procedural concerns raised by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. They even recorded the grave concerns over the lack of human and other resources to conduct the trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only would a full rollout of this scheme be prohibitively expensive; there just aren't enough qualified people to administer the test or provide the necessary treatment services for anything more than a trial. At the start I mentioned five principles that you don't expect a government in a free society to do. A government must not be arbitrary, wilful, cruel or petty, and it should rarely sanction government action that interferes with the physical and bodily integrity of the individual, yet this is exactly what this government is proposing. It is shameful, as are some of the other measures this government is proposing for our most disadvantaged citizens. I really feel government members should rethink this bill, rethink what they're doing and, for once, listen to the experts and the science.</span>

I acknowledge his long time in the medical profession prior to coming into this House, but I do disagree with the member for Macarthur on the notion that this measure is not worth trialling for the benefit of those who have a drug dependency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge there will be those who will not be happy about it, but, at the end of the day, it is my firm beliefâI spoke on the original bill some 12 months agoâand it remains my belief that we have a responsibility to try and find ways to assist people with a drug dependency break that drug dependency. It's important to remember that as part of receiving the Newstart allowance, which is a payment made from taxpayers' funds to those who are unemployed for whatever reason, they sign an agreement. The new agreement will include a provision for drug testing. If they don't wish to be drug tested, maybe they can look for another way to provide funding for themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing Trial) Bill 2018 is to introduce or to set up a trial. Surely the opportunity to set up a trial and try something new or different has merit. This bill is not about punishing those who are unemployed or who have a drug or substance abuse problem. It is about working with those people to ensure that we can provide them with the support services necessary and the assistance necessary to break that substance abuse habit, find meaningful employment and return to the workforce to ensure they can provide for their families and contribute to their community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken to many people across my electorate who believe this policy is a good step towards not only helping people with drug related problems but ensuring their taxpayer welfare dollars are being used to support people in the right way. A welfare system is designed to provide a safety net for those who find themselves out of work or unable to participate in the workforce. It is not there to perpetuate people's drug habits or, as the member for Macarthur said, line the pockets of drug dealers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While there have been outspoken naysayers who fear that targeting Logan as a trial site stigmatises the region, I say to them that the status quo has done nothing, and the stigmatising of the regionâsadly, from many people outside the region who don't know the Logan area wellâhad already created difficulties. We don't want to stigmatise people on welfare; that is not the objective of this bill. We want to help those people with identified drug issues and get them the support that they need. To that end, recently the government invested $1 million in family units at a drug rehabilitation facilityâat Logan House, in Chambers Flat in my electorate. So there is investment being made in services to our community to assist people that have a drug dependency issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's National Drug Strategy Household Survey 2013 showed that those who were unemployed were 2.4 times more likely to use ice and other drugs than those who were employed. In 2016-17, there were some 22,000 temporary incapacity exemptions given to over 16,000 jobseekers because of a drug and/or an alcohol dependency issue. On top of that, Australia's expenditure on alcohol and other drug treatment services in 2012-13 was $1.2 billion, with about one-third of this spending coming from the Australian government. Imagine what that funding could pay for if we succeeded in reducing drug and alcohol abuse. If we ignore these statistics, bury our heads in the sand and do not address the underlying issues, nothing will change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The three trial sites chosen are Logan, in Queensland; Mandurah, in Western Australia; and Canterbury Bankstown, in New South Wales. As I touched on earlier, along with the member for Wright and the member for Rankin, I represent Logan in this House. There have been a variety of views expressed across the Logan community about the trial, but predominantly the feedback to my office has been in support of it. Less forthcoming has been support from Logan City Council. However, interestingly, Logan City Council do drug test their employees, and we don't hear any complaints about the drug testing of employees at Logan City Council or, for that matter, the drug testing of employees in many workforces across the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These sites chosen for the trial, as I said before, were not chosen to stigmatise the region or those on welfare. This proposal, as I said at the outset, is for a trial that seeks to identify and support the people we need to assist in breaking the habit of drug and alcohol abuse. To do this, the areas of Logan, Mandurah and Canterbury-Bankstown were identified as trial sites. It is important that part of the proposed legislation ensures that we build counselling, health and rehabilitation services in those areas to support the people who are identified as having an issue. I would say that, in the City of Logan, we already have some outstanding counselling, health and rehabilitation facilities. I touched on Logan House briefly, but there are many others. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed to bolstering those services with a dedicated treatment fund of up to $10 million to support jobseekers in those drug-testing trial areas. This fund will provide additional treatment support in the trial locations where existing state or Commonwealth services and supports are not equipped to meet the additional demands as a result of the trial. The reason this is important is that, as we get people off drugs and, hopefully, by extension, off welfare, they can re-enter the workforce. In re-entering the workforce, they build or rebuild their self-esteem, they rebuild their capacity to provide for their families and they build, possibly, the capacity for their children to play sport or get involved in community groups that they otherwise don't have. It actually provides a far greater opportunity for these people to contribute to our communities in a positive way. That is important, because all of these people have skills, talents and capabilities which, if they're able to be utilised to their fullest extent, make our community a better place for all of us to live in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Logan community, sadly, there is a drug problem. But we know that if we can continue to provide those supports and provide additional opportunities through this proposed trial, we can break some of these cycles, including the cycle of intergenerational welfare dependency, which I think plays a large part. In Logan, over two years through the trial, around 2,500 people are expected to be tested. If a Newstart or youth allowance recipient does test positive, they'll receive their payments via income management. This measure is designed to restrict the recipient's access to cash and limit their ability to use their payments to fund further drug use, while not reducing the amount of payment received. A jobseeker who tests positive will also be subject to a second test within 25 working days, and may also be subject to further tests. This will help identify those that require treatment with an ongoing program. If the report from the medical professional recommends treatment, the jobseeker will be required to participate in one or more treatment activities to address their substance abuse as part of their job plan. This could include rehabilitation, counselling or case management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe this plan will ensure that our welfare recipients' payments will help them pay for their rent, food, medical and basic needs, rather than lining the pockets of drug dealers. But how will we know if the trial is a success? The government will be running an evaluation of the trial at the same time as the trial is being undertaken, so that if we see problems with the trial, we can make changes if need be. I'll reiterate: in supporting jobseekers who have a substance-abuse problem, I believe we're actually upholding our mandate as a government to support those people who need it most, when they need it most. The importance of a trial is to understand, through doing something differentâsomething that we haven't done beforeâwhether this works and whether it genuinely helps people in this situation. At the end of the day, as an assessment of the trial, that is the most important aspect: has the trial succeeded in helping people who are on Newstart, who have a substance-abuse problem, breaking that habit of substance abuse and being able to re-enter the workforce and use their skills and talents to the best of their ability, to create a life for their families, to contribute to the community, and to re-establish and restore the self-esteem and the self-respect that we know that people with a drug dependency frequently lose as a result of that dependency?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing Trial) Bill 2018, has the potential to provide an opportunity for some to live a much brighter future than they would have if they remained stuck in that mire of drug dependency and welfare. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:09</span>):  I rise today to oppose the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing Trial) Bill 2018. This bill reintroduces a 2017-18 budget measure to establish a two-year trial of drug testing for 5,000 recipients of Newstart and youth allowance and now identifies the three trial locations: Canterbury Bankstown in New South Wales, Logan in Queensland and Mandurah in Western Australia. The government previously introduced this measure as part of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017. Labor opposed many of the measures in the welfare reform bill, including the drug testing trial. The drug testing trial measure was subsequently withdrawn from the welfare reform bill due to lack of support in the Senate, but this government seems determined to proceed with this measure, which the Australian Medical Association has described as 'mean and stigmatising'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke against this cruel and mean-spirited measure last year, and I speak against it again now. I speak from my firsthand experience of working with people with substance dependency over the last 20 years. Since my second year as a pharmacy student in the mid-nineties, I have worked with people living with addiction and dependency. Addiction and dependency is a health issue. Dependency doesn't discriminate between those who are working and those who are looking for work. The government's attempt to conflate drug misuse with unemployment is not just wrong; it's harmful. While I was training as a pharmacist, I worked in a community pharmacyâone of the first in New South Wales to provide an opioid treatment program. This program, underpinned by the principles of harm minimisation, has led to many people being able to rebuild their lives and their relationships and to gain employment, and it has been provided by community pharmacies since the late 1970s. I met teachers, chefs and executives all turning their lives around, with the support of GPs, pharmacists and addiction specialists. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, I worked as a mental health pharmacist, providing clinical support to an OTP clinic and a withdrawal management clinic in Wyong Hospital. This in-patient unit provides withdrawal management from an evidence based, clinically-proven harm minimisation approach. It works. The problem is that there are just 15 beds at Wyong Hospital for the entire Central Coast. This unit is also part of the state-wide referral process receiving clients from all across New South Wales, particularly from areas where there are no local services. If the government is genuine in its claim to help those burdened by dependence, a good first step would be to properly fund units like this one and not attack welfare recipients. The current services are stretched and there are long waiting lists. Clients wait anxiously by their phone for a text message so that they can enter the unit as soon as there is a bed. If there is to be any likelihood of success, the government must work with the states to ensure that there are sufficient places for people entering treatment and that the necessary mental health and social services are available. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are still unable to provide any evidence to support the establishment of their drug testing trial, and they have still not revealed the cost. Clinicians in the drug and alcohol treatment sector have raised significant concerns about these measures, not only their impact on jobseekers but that they won't be effective in identifying those with a dependency or referring them to appropriate treatment. A former colleague, a drug and alcohol clinician whom I spoke to, described this proposal as 'technically flawed and socially irresponsible'. She fears it will punish people by taking away their only means of financial support and is concerned it will send them undergroundâin her wordsâ'forcing vulnerable people into further disadvantage, homelessness and potentially crime'. As she sees it, this is the government using drug testing as a punitive measure. She is also concerned about technical aspects of the proposal. She asked: 'We know the drug testing will be contracted out to a third party, but will they have the right expertise? Will they be skilled drug and alcohol clinicians who can thoroughly assess the extent of substance use? Will people who are quite legitimately enrolled in opioid treatment programs be caught up in this trial?' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is yet another attempt by the government to demonise jobseekers and is likely to be at significant cost to the budget. Experts warn that these changes will not help people overcome dependency. This is not how dependency works. Instead, they will be pushed into crisis, poverty, homelessness and potentially crime. The government wants to trial drug testing of 5,000 recipients of Newstart and youth allowance in the Canterbury Bankstown, Logan and Mandurah regions. We are told that testing will be undertaken by a contracted private provider. The government have not announced the cost of this, nor do they know the detail of what types of tests will be conducted. Where is the evidence and where are the details? The National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre commented:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is no evidence that any of these measures will directly achieve outcomes associated with reductions in alcohol or other drug use or harm, and indeed have the potential to create greater levels of harm, including increased stigma, marginalisation and poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look now to overseas examples. Drug testing of income support recipients has been trialled in several countries, and there is no evidence that it has been effective. In 2013, the New Zealand government instituted a drug-testing program amongst welfare recipients. In 2015, only 22 of 8,001 recipients tested returned a positive result for illicit drug use. This detection rate was much lower than the proportion of the general New Zealand population estimated to be using illicit drugs. Similar results were found in the United States. In Missouri's 2014 testing program, of the state's 38,970 welfare applicants, 446 were tested with 48 testing positive. In Utah, 838 of the state's 9,552 applicants were screened with 29 returning a positive result. These were costly initiativesâcostly initiatives that drive people into poverty and potentially crime. We don't know the full cost of the government's measures yet, and we haven't seen evidence to support it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Social Services' own figures show that very few jobseekers are likely to test positive. A recent Senate estimates hearing heard that overall the department expects only 100 to 120 people to test positive a second time across the three trial sites. That's $1 million committed for an evaluation of a trial that is likely to impact up to 120 people, before we know how much the contract to the private provider will cost. Concerns have been raised about these measures by health and welfare groups, including St Vincent's Health, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, ACOSS and Uniting Care, amongst others. Not a single health or community organisation has come out publicly in support of this trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Addiction medicine specialists I've spoken to, and others who've been reported on, are concerned about the technical aspects of the trial. For example, the government is yet to confirm what sort of test will be usedâurine, hair, saliva. With lower-cost tests there is a risk of false positives. Reliable tests can be extremely costly and likely unaffordable. For example, according to the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, a gold standard urine tests costs been $550 and $950 to administer. The testing could potentially encourage people to use less-traceable but more-harmful drugs or increase alcohol consumption, which is not being tested as part of the trial. Consultation with the treatment sector suggests that there are long waiting lists for treatment around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn now to speak particularly about women and children who may be caught up in this trial. In New South Wales, there are only three residential treatment programs for women with children experiencing addictionâKamira in my electorate, Jarrah House in Little Bay, which has a short 10-week program, and Kathleen York House in Glebe, which has only eight beds. I spoke to the CEO of Kamira, who also sits on the Network of Alcohol and Other Drugs Agencies' subcommittee for women, where this proposal has already been raised as a concern. In her view, this trial is set up for failure. She said to me that it will marginalise people already on the bottom rung of the ladder. Currently Kamira, like other treatment centres, is full, which would mean a two- to four-month wait for treatment. These are the questions she thought should be answered: What will happen if a woman tests positive? Will her children be removed by FACs? Will she lose housing after losing her children and become homeless? This is the harsh reality of this drug treatment trial. And, in New South Wales, all of these services are NGOs; there are no government funded residential rehabilitation services for women in New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These trials will put increased pressure on the system, and, where treatment is unavailable, jobseekers identified as having a problem with drugs will have difficulty accessing the treatment prescribed. Further, health professionals warn that treatment is not successful unless a drug user is ready to seek treatment. Forcing people to turn up will not address their drug issues. It will put pressure on an already stretched sector and displace people genuinely seeking treatment. John Ryan, CEO of the Penington Institute, commented:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I strongly urge the Government to reconsider and reverse this retrograde approach to welfare before we see the increase in crime it is likely to create.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia there is a real lack of funding for drug treatment servicesâincluding medically supported drug treatment. The Government would have been better off making stronger investments there rather than attacking the vulnerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government was genuine about trying to help people overcome addiction or seek treatment, it would do this differently. Labor is open to considering genuine attempts to help people into treatment, but these changes will impact people with serious illness, pushing them into financial hardship and, potentially, crime. The trial could put Centrelink staff at risk of aggression and violence as they attempt to enforce drug testing on participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Associate Professor Yvonne Bonomo, the director of St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne's Department of Addiction Medicine, has said exactly that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">International experience shows when you push people to the brink, like removing their welfare payments, things just get worse. There will be more crime, more family violence, more distress within society. We can expect at Centrelink offices there will be aggression and violence as people react to this. Had [the government] spoken to the various bodies who work in this area and know about this work, we would have been able to advise them this is not the right way. Pushing people to the brink won't make it better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this bill is risky. As I mentioned at the outset, I've worked with people living with drug dependency and addiction for 20 years before entering this House. From my second year as a pharmacy student, I worked with people on the Opioid Treatment Program in community pharmacies. In the last 10 years before I came into this House, I worked as a mental health specialist pharmacist and also was a clinical support to an OTP clinic and an inpatient rehabilitation service. As I said at the outset, addiction and dependency are health issues. Dependency doesn't discriminate between those who are working and those who are looking for work. This government's attempt to link drug use or drug misuse with unemployment is wrong and it is harmful. I oppose this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing Trial) Bill 2018. I spent some time in my electorate meeting with local action groups and people trying to deal with the scourge of drug addiction in our community. I remember sitting down at a meeting one day with parents, with survivors and with a handful of people trying to kick the habit. A mother looked at me and she said, 'My daughter is trying to get off drugs. She's really trying hard, but every one of her friends uses drugs. She makes a bit of a break and then the friends are all around her, and she falls back.' Then she looked at me even more intently. She looked into my eyes, I suppose you could say, and she said, 'And you keep giving her money.' When she said 'you', she meant that the government kept giving her daughter money. It was money that she couldn't control and money that went directly into drugs. She's right: it's a challengeâit's a real challenge. We do give money with no strings attached. There's no compulsion to spend it on food, on shelter, on education or on help to get off drugs. We just give them cash.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this is not what Newstart and youth allowance are meant to be for. Newstart and youth allowance are meant to sustain a person and to help them prepare to get into a job. One thing you can't doâor not in too many placesâis get into a job if you're on drugs. If you do get into a job, OH&amp;S will probably rule you out pretty quickly and you won't be in a job anymore. Let me tell you, it can be hard enough to find workers in regional Australiaâperhaps that too is part of the debate. Why is it that we have pools of regional unemployment, where in fact we can't seem to shift those people that are in that regional pool of unemployment into work when we know there is work available? I know local businesses that have reached out to these groups of people who are unemployed and have had a red-hot go at trying to get them into the workforce. They need workers, so they were willing to give it a go. They've taken starters in for training, educated them, assisted them and counselled them, only to have them fail at a drug test either in training or on the job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scourge of drugs in our community is a cancer. The members on the other side are right: it is a health issue. Absolutely, it's a health issue. Absolutely, it's a drug addiction that is beyond the means of those who are suffering from it. But we have to identify them, we have to find out who they are and we have to try to get services to them so that we can actually interrupt that lifestyle to make a real difference. Every time an employer is burned in the way that I've just described, it makes it that much harder next time to get that employer to consider someone with similar problems. It is that much harder for them to take the risk. Every time a worker is struck out, their record of failure is extended. Every time they fail, their self-esteem is further eroded. Every time they fail, the call of the drugs becomes ever stronger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We simply have to try. At this place, of all places in Australia, we simply have to try. We've tried many things over the yearsâso many programs. The previous speaker was speaking about her life in trying to work with people in rehabilitation programs. Boy, there have been some resources thrown at it over the years, and I would have to say the record isn't all that good. So we have to try something different, I think. It is time to really try something different, because, if we can't keep that trainee or that employee off drugs, they will lose their job and they will fail.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had the privilege of seeing the merits of the cashless welfare card trial in Ceduna. I know it's not the same, but there are enough similarities here to draw a parallel. Certainly the 80-20 split on income is the same split that operates under the cashless welfare card, so in that case it's directly comparable. In Ceduna, the introduction of that card has made a real difference. It's certainly made a difference to alcohol consumption in the community. It's made a difference to the way that children are treated in their homes. It's made a difference to the amount of money that is spent on food in that community. So I think we can easily draw that parallel to this program for drug testing of those on Newstart and youth allowance and those who enter the programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about a trial of 5,000 people. It's not nationwide. We're not doing it everywhere in Australia. It's a geographically discrete trial for Canterbury-Bankstown, Logan and Mandurah. I say let's give it a go. Absolutely let's give it a go. I wonder what those on the other side of the House are scared of. Perhaps it might be that it would work. What if it works? It is a trial of 5,000 people. What if it actually works and starts making a significant difference in getting these people off drugs and getting them into the workforce, taking control of their lives? For pity's sake, let's move to help our young and most vulnerable. Let's help that mother who looked into my eyes and stop sending cash. Let's help those people try to kick their drug addictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Step 1 is failure of the first drug test. That leads to 80 per cent of income going on the BasicsCard, which is just like the cashless welfare card, and 20 per cent to spend as the recipient wishes. Sadly, that can still be spent on drugs. There is no reduction in income at allânot one cent. There is just a requirement to spend the money on the good things in life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm reminded, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrewsâand I think you were probably there tooâof when we had Twiggy Forrest come into our joint party room to brief us about the cashless welfare card. He was suggesting at that time that it should apply to 100 per cent of income. Subsequently, after negotiation in the Ceduna community with various peopleâthe leadership of the Indigenous groups and also the local council and other people in the townâit was decided there would be an 80-20 split. I raised the question with Mr Forrest. I said: 'I get what you're saying, but you don't think 100 per cent's a bit harsh? You don't think maybe we ought to give a bit of money to people to make decisions about their lives, to have a bit of cash to go to the pub or whatever it might be?' He said: 'Well, you can if you like. It's up to you. You could make it 80-20 or fifty-fifty. You do whatever you like. But you should ask yourself the question: is it the taxpayers' responsibility to fund somebody's alcohol, drug and gambling addictions?' That's a very good question. I think you clearly understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I think those on the other side do as well, that that is not what Newstart and youth allowance are for. They are not to fund drug addictions. They are to try and get people through a tough spot and then get them into the workforce. That's step 1.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Step 2 is the second failure: no loss of income at all as long as the recipient is prepared to stay involved and engaged with the scheme. Where there is a loss of income is if they refuse to engageâthat is, refuse a drug test. That would most certainly cease the payments, because somewhere in this pile of tools we have to have some stick; there are plenty of carrots. That would mean that their payments cease until they re-enter the program. However, the most important part of step 2 is that the recipient is referred to medical assessment and then rehabilitation. This is where the rubber hits the road, where we help these individuals take control of their lives and take the first steps to getting rid of their dependency on drugs. The government has provided $10 million for that medical assessment and rehabilitation service, which is around $2,000 per person for the 5,000 people that will be involved in the trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole program is about identification. It is about finding those people in the community who are abusing their bodies. Step 2 becomes about wellness, the steps to recovery and putting people in control of their lives. Those who oppose medical assessment and treatment for people with drug addiction should probably stand up and say so quite clearly. They shouldn't prevaricate, saying it is not fair and is victimisation; they should state how they don't mind if taxpayer funds are used to feed drug habits. It is pretty depressing. The trial is to be evaluated by an independent body, information on individuals will remain discreet, and drug users will not be referred to the police. As I said, the drug testing is an identification tool. Once we find out who these people are, we can get the right people in their lives to help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want people to engage and to attend treatment courses, and we are going to treat that as a jobseeker activity. As you would well know, people on Newstart are required to engage: to attend interviews or be in education. If the person involved is attending treatment, that will count as a jobactive activity. That's because the government wants the individual to change and take control of their life. Young people in Australia are perhaps those most heavily suffering through drug use. Out of 18 comparable European countries Australia has the second-highest usage of methamphetamine. Only quite recently have we seen those figures about the sewage content of our major cities. It is really scary stuff. We need to take action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time to stop wringing our hands and say, 'We're going to do something; we're going to have a go at some early intervention.' Let's hope it works. Maybe it won't work or make a scrap a difference, but it is a trial, just as the cashless welfare card is a trial, and the runs are on the board with the cashless welfare card. We know it is a good thing and we are looking to extend that trial into other areas. We want to do the same with this: just give it a go. If it's no good, those on the other side can knock it down as a complete failure and say, 'We told you so,' but at least let us not stand here in a few years time and say, 'We had a good idea, but we were all too gutless to give it a go, quite frankly.' We need to get on board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Newspoll 73 per cent of voters back the trial. Why? The voters see the damage on a daily basis. They are the parents of children in trouble. People know what's going on in our communities. I get told constantlyâas just about every member of this House does, I betâabout the ravages of drugs in their community, and to do something about it. Well, this is a chance to do something about it. It's a chance to give it a red-hot go, a chance to try to get people to take control of their lives and to give them the tools to do so. But we can't do that if we refuse to engage with them. If we're just waiting for them all to step forward and have the moment of realisation that they're no longer in control of their life, then we're going to lose a lot of them along the way. This is the early identification program. This is the thing that can change your life. If you've been unemployed for five, six or seven years and you've got a drug habit, there's a fair chance it'll be for the rest of your life. We need to get in earlier than that and make a difference earlier. So, I implore those on the other side to think about what it is they are trying to oppose here and come on board and give this trial a fair dinkum go.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  I'm sure to the great disappointment of the member for Grey, Labor will not be getting on board with the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing Trial) Bill 2018 and we will oppose itâabsolutely oppose it. We will do that not on the basis of ideology but on the basis of evidence that has been given to us and to the government from many experts who work in the area of addiction and treatmentâwelfare experts and also people who are affected by this terrible health issue. As the member for Dobell made very clearâand she is better placed than most people in this place to make it clearâthis is a health issue. Dependency will not be managed or sorted out by this particular measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will firstly say that it is the view of the Labor Party that the government is making a second attempt to pass this measure, and we hope it ends up as disastrous as the first attempt. Last time around the community, the medical experts and the addiction treatment experts said that this will not work. Nothing has changed from that position, and nothing has changed from the position Labor has taken. This piece of legislation and this trial will drive vulnerable people away from income support. It will drive people who are suffering from addiction away from rehabilitation. It will drive desperate people to do desperate things. The Victorian Alcohol and Drug Association said in its submission on the bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill is premised on a range of assumptions regarding substance use and implies a connection between substance use and unemployment. This connection is overly simplistic and tenuous at best and does not account for the range of elements contributing to entrenched unemployment, such as regional variance in opportunity, family violence and mental health issues. It implies that illicit substance use is a key driver to unemployment and it fails to acknowledge that substance use and dependence is ubiquitous across a range of demographics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anglicare Australia said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is no evidence that people using welfare benefits and looking for a job generally have a higher incidence of drug use than the general population.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the government is confusing a healthcare issue with welfare, and the government is fabricating a narrative that is grossly and maliciously misleading and harmful. I will have more to say on that in a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the question of this bill, this government is ignoring the experts and it is ignoring the evidence. This bill proposes a trial of random drug testing among some 5,000 income support recipients at selected locations around Australiaâas has been articulated, Logan in Queensland, Mandurah in Western Australia and Canterbury-Bankstown in Sydney, an area that I am incredibly familiar with. In establishing this trial, the government, through the Department of Social Services, says it consulted with various government and non-government stakeholders. I question that. Of the 53 submissions received on this bill, opposing submissions were received from a number of community groups, including the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists. the Australian Injecting Illicit Drug Users League, Anglicare Australia, the Community and Public Sector Union, the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations, Logan City Council, UnitingCare Australia, the Australian Association of Social Workers and the St Vincent de Paul Society.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013 the then peak Commonwealth advisory group, the Australian National Council on Drugsâthe government's own bodyâreviewed evidence on the impact of drug testing welfare recipients and concluded:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is no evidence that drug testing welfare beneficiaries will have any positive effects for those individuals or for society, and some evidence indicating such a practice could have high social and economic costs. In addition, there would be serious ethical and legal problems in implementing such a program in Australia. Drug testing of welfare beneficiaries ought not be considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was in 2013. This is an extract that is almost universally cited among the opposing submissions received from the community on this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013 the New Zealand government instituted a drug-testing program among welfare recipients. The member for Dobell spoke about this, and I won't go over the statistics from New Zealand, except to say that, of the 8,001 participants tested in New Zealand, only 22 returned a positive result. We saw the same in Utah and also in Missouri, where the testing outcomes were about the same. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The submission from the Department of Social Services estimated that up to 10 per cent of those tested will test positive to an illegal substance. Yet the College of Psychiatrists says it believes this is a gross overestimate and that it is more likely to be less than one per cent. You've got to ask: is it best to put the money into this or to put the money into rehabilitation and programs that are going to help people with a drug addiction? St Vincent de Paul says that, given the disproportionately large number of people who will test negative, it will inconvenience an unreasonably large number of people applying for income support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre has questioned the scientific basis and research standards and integrity of this so-called trial. The centre questioned the geographical focus of the trial, the lack of a trial protocol, ethics approval, the independence of the research team and the absence of auditing or trial monitoring. That says to me that, if a trial is going to be a genuine trial, you would think that those measures were in place. The centre also went on to question the arbitrary nature of drug testing of welfare recipients: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The "reasonable excuse provisions" is one example of how this Bill fails to understand the nature of drug dependence. "Reasonable excuse provisions" will apply but not where the reason is wholly or substantially attributable to drug or alcohol use. This is the same as suggesting that if a patient with cancer fails to attend for a chemotherapy session â¦ they are penalised because it is the cancer that has prevented their attendance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is grossly misjudged and ill thought through. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many groups have also expressed their concern about the disproportionately costly nature of this measure. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists estimates the cost of testing to be approximately $500 to $900 each. The college said that the time and money and resources projected to be sunk into this trial could be better spent on treatment services, and that is certainly the view of the Labor Party. Anglicare Australia says the costs could be up to $1,600 per positive result and cites the New Zealand trial, which spent $1 million testing 8,000 welfare recipients and, as I said, returned 22 positive results. That's over $45,000 per positive result. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when the government has slashed 2,500 jobs from the Department of Human Services and is crying a budget emergency, the government is really cutting off its nose to spite the face of vulnerable income support recipients. Even the efficacy of this approach to rehabilitation has been brought into question by Anglicare, which says, 'Mandatory drug rehabilitation has been repeatedly found to be one of the least effective ways for people to overcome a drug addiction.' How can the government be so blind to not be listening to people that know what they are doing in this space? </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I often see my clients drop out of their reporting obligations due to existing reporting requirements and red tape. By enforcing testing, these amendments will create further bureaucratic hurdles for people to clear before receiving the meagre rate of pay that Newstart affords. Not receiving a Centrelink payment prevents an unemployed person from secure tenancies or participating in community, and increases the risk of homelessness and long term unemployment.</span>

More than 982 doctors, nurses, addiction specialists and allied health professionals signed an open letter calling on the government to end its mandatory drug testing for people receiving income supportâ982 people that know what they're talking about. Amongst the signatories were 109 addiction specialists, 330 doctors, 208 registered nurses and hundreds of other allied health professionals. How much louder does the call have to be for this government to grow some sort of sense and sensitivity about this and understand that this is a fraught proposition?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has confused addiction, a healthcare issue, with income support, and it is not fair. It is not appropriate, and I am sick of this government demonising people who from time to time throughout their lives have to rely on welfare. It is unbelievable when you look at the litany of the outcomes in Centrelink and the fact that there have been so many jobs cut. There have been people accused of owing money that they didn't owe. There has been mistake after mistake. There have been 55 million unanswered calls, and under this government we have seen Centrelink wait times increase. In that context, the government pushes ahead with this ill-informed trial in three sites. It's ill informed, and I would urge people to vote against this, particularly when it goes to the other place. Listen to the experts. Listen to people that find themselves in these very difficult situations, and make a distinction between what is a health and welfare issue and what is an employment issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is just unbelievable to me that this government would not listen to the experts and would not understand that the government's commitment of $10 million is a drop in the ocean when it comes to treatment. Anyone that has tried to support someone to get into treatment will know how difficult it is. Whilst the government say, 'Oh, well, this will be seen as part of a person's mutual obligation,' I question whether the government thought those things through and whether they've actually tested them. I've questioned the government on whether or not there are going to be the available facilities out there to support people who need this support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to understand how the government has thrown together unemployment, people needing to rely on welfare assistance and drug addiction. There is no connection. We know that drug addiction affects all demographics, we know that drug addiction does not discriminate, and we certainly understand that drug addiction is a healthcare issue. It will not be fixed up by further penalising people who are relying on Newstart and other payments. It is a ludicrous proposition that the government has put in front of itself. Time will show that this trial is a waste of taxpayers' money and that the money spent on this trial, if it ever gets up, would have been better spent on services that support people with addiction and that look at as a healthcare issue and not as something which can be controlled through people's access to Centrelink payments. </span>

                    <a href="E0H" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAMING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  It is an exciting evening in the federal parliament, where I'm quietly optimistic that the trial being proposed in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing Trial) Bill 2018 will go ahead. This trial was originally conceived back in 2013. I remember the member for Gilmore was right there in the coalition welfare reform group, which was formed in that year. The member for Braddon, a young whipper-snapper, the member for Pearce, who had just joined the parliament, and I were also in that group. Together, we started to conceive what we thought was the next step in the Work for the Dole mutual obligation. We slowly worked our way through to make sure that there was hope for every Australian, where they could one day hold down a job and have a chance in the brilliant economy that this current government runs. Of course, that is not the case at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are large proportions of the population, particularly in poor electorates, which are completely distanced from the opportunities that Australia offers. That's just not bad for them; we know through epigenetics and intensive social policy research that that is bad for their kids as well. This is an intergenerational challenge that needs to be broken. In the 1990s, just as we were starting to make progress as a coalition government in the area of Work for the Dole, the possibility that a person would be made to be active in return for their payment was considered anathema. It was people like John Howard and Tony Abbott, the then employment ministerâand even my father, Bruce Laming, who brought down the new employment policies from Queenslandâwho were urging businesses to take on an extra worker and find a way to connect people to work, because, fundamentally in the Liberal Party, we never give up on anyone. We will never give up on an individual and say: 'You're on drugs. There's nothing we can do.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen over decades from those on the other side of the chamber, the Labor Party, and from peak welfare groups is a persistent behaviour whereby they throw up their hands and say: 'There is just nothing we can do. If they don't feel like doing it, we're not going to make them do it.' This was the attitude of a large number of the employment service providers in the 1990s. Anyone who has been around long enough will remember how it was utterly unfeasible to contemplate that an individual would be made to actually get out of bed and turn up somewhere for work. All the same excuses were trotted out. By golly, on the coalition side, we have seen, thank goodness, from government most of the time, some of these ridiculous excusesâand haven't we heard them all?âbeing trotted out almost hysterically by peak welfare groups. I'm most disappointed to see a select group, even within learned medical colleges, dancing to this same tune. There are probably highly selective experts within a greater profession who strongly support these initiatives, because they understand: 'What is the alternative? What is the alternative to raising a white flag as ice is being trucked around in vehicles on a passenger seat and sold to young kids, who then fall out of school, or to young girls, who then fall to prostitution or who turn to crime?' They are using those same excuses to say, 'Let's not do anything about it, because it might make that happen.' For goodness sake, that is already happening! That is the status quo. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has the second-highest use of methamphetamine in the OECD, where we have suitable comparative data. Australia is literally awash with it. I don't mean to be hysterical about this, but we've heard read speeches from the Labor Party and we've heard non-noted speeches from the coalition, because we speak from the heart about this. We know that 83 per cent of coalition voters are behind us on this issue. We know that 65 per cent of Labor voters distance themselves from Labor representatives on this issue. We know that nearly three-quarters of Australians fundamentally look at this problem and say: 'Ice is a bloody tragic thing. I've seen mums and dads who, the minute they leave home, watch their son pull out the stereo and try to hock it to drug dealers.' This is a really hard issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be told by those on the other side that there is no evidence for an initiative that is fundamentally a trial speaks to their inability to simply understand what this is. It is world-leading. It is groundbreaking. And it has the word 'trial' in it for a good reason. There is nothing similar between the Australian proposals and the US states that made quite energetic but ultimately futile attempts, with quite perverse and damaging outcomes for those who were found to be positive. It is also quite different from the New Zealand actuarial models, where they introduced drug testing if one were applying for a job where drug testing was already happening. These are completely different concepts. What we have here is effectively a non-punitive measure that forms, in the brief of intervention science, that opportunity to say to someone, 'You know you have a problem here, because we have the drug test.' Up until now, what the welfare system relies on is someone walking forward and saying, 'You do know that I'm on drugs, and I'd really like to get off them.' There are people like that, but there are not very many.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ice is characteristic of this feature: people don't genuinely believe that they can just simply go and get help and everything will be okay. For many people it is futile, hopeless and desperate. For many people, they are looking after minors, dragging them into child care at noon, engaging in prostitution from home, ducking back to pick up the kid again and then having the door kicked in as drug dealers are seeking payment. What three-year-old deserves to have that treatment? There is someone pushing past a three-year-old, watching a drug deal trying to settle debts, because they know there is money in the house somewhere. This is the status quo that we are trying to break.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By breaking the status quo, there were three or four key considerations. That first consideration is that we must respect the privacy of the individual and adhere to the legal obligations of this nation. We're not profiling people. We're not saying, 'We don't like the cut of your jib. We want you to step into the side room.' This is about a prospective, grandfathered, signing up of new Newstart recipients to the possibility of that test. Because that particular cohort is up to three times more likely to be on recreational drugs, they have got to be prepared to face a simple test. It's a non-invasive test. It doesn't go on your criminal record. Someone doesn't pick up the telephone and tell the police. No, people can't rummage through your files and find out the result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a career of drug taking, where one is building a criminal or a dislocation resume faster than they are building an occupational or educational one, we are trying to find that opportunity to break into the cycle somewhere. The whole point is that at the moment there is nowhere to break into the cycle. If the state has a chance to say, 'This could be the moment. You are losing your house. You are losing your kids. Your job is long gone. At what point do we keep paying for your drug habit using taxpayers' money?' That is possibly one last chance before a drug addiction continues unabated and out of control for years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why instinctively Australians like the idea. They appreciate that there is not the evidence, because it has not been tried before. They want to see something done. As soon as we know that someone has a positive test, nothing is taken away and the payment goes on. It's a BasicsCard; about 80 per cent of it is onto a BasicsCard. There is still the liquidity to do pretty much everything one needs to do. You have intensive case and financial management available. Finally, and let's remember this, it becomes awfully hard to pay the drug dealer. It's not impossible. You can go out and flog stuff, but you will be picked up by the police and you will have another problem on your hands. You will be going cold turkey in jail. There are no easy ways out of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I'm saying here is not to simply throw your hands up and say, 'I wouldn't want to step between a drug taker and their drugs. I wouldn't want to get between them and their habit. Let's keep paying them taxpayers' money so we don't have any trouble from them.' That's the counternarrative coming from the other side. That's not the narrative of Australia, of hope, of justice and of giving it a red-hot crack. We will do everything in our power, as the state, to help people off ice. It is not a public good. It is not something to be protected nor something to be feared. When we initially designed this policy in 2013, we could not have dreamed that the great party of the Labor Party would actually oppose it. We never thought one could be that politically lucky, but in fact we saw Labor literally and figuratively wet their pants over this issue. It was really, really unbelievable that they did everything they could to stop the smallest and most modest of trials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a trial. If it's not financially or clinically effective, it will not continue. But what was the first objection put up by the Labor Party? There may not be enough treatment facilities out there. The treatment facilities will be overrun with queues going around the corner like in Cuba. At the same time, you have another individual up here saying, 'The pick-up rate will be so low. It will be down to 0.0001 per cent. It will be catastrophic. What a waste of money with no positives.' Of course, you can't have it both ways, can you? What you can have is every single excuse you can dream up distilled into a Labor Party policy. That is what has been presented. 'It is an invasion of privacy. It erodes all morals that we have in this nation up to this point. It's a complete intrusion. It'll lead to an outbreak of crime around the nation where the idea is trialled.' To ask for evidence out of this policy but then to purport that their counternarrative is in any way evidence is just really, really ridiculous. They have dreamt up, as a Labor Party, every possible objection, but it doesn't stand scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a coalition have designed a forward, prospective, grandfathered approach systematically and without any selection bias, doing a simple trial. We know that rates of drug use are high in this cohort, and Australians would expect us to do everything within our power. Once the first positive is received, then, of course, we have the financial intervention. There isn't the ability to use the cashless debit card in some of these trial areas. Then there is obviously the possibility of a second positive test. What's forgotten by the other side is not so much the impact on the individual being tested or testing positive but the signal that sends through the entire half a million people on Newstart who are signing up prospectively that it could happen to them. It makes the likelihood of them being work ready every Monday morning that slight bit higher.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The testing could well be in a longer form, using hair bulb testing rather than saliva or a buccal swab. If that's the case, they're going to be looking at a far longer period of recreational drug use, which is almost impossible to hide. We've moved now into an era of extremely high-level and effective technology. It is incredibly cheap and extremely accurate, and, in a single test, it is able to pick up up to eight different recreational drugs. That was never used in any of the previous tests. That wasn't used in New Zealand. It wasn't used in the US, and that is a nation that still gets people to walk in a straight line to see if they're over the blood alcohol level. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is brand-new, cutting-edge technology. I have to acknowledge that the nation's drug testers, who are doing amazing work in the major occupations of mining and industry, have said this is a simple process to step it into those who are looking for work. Isn't it the coalition policy that, if you can't get a job but you are receiving a government payment in lieu of one, you should be ready to turn up on Monday morning and do a job? This feeds into that very simple mentality that, 'No, not everyone has a job, but everyone should be ready to go to work if they're physically and mentally fit and able to do so and in the appropriate age range.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish where I started. This is a party of hope and belief. What you've heard from the Labor Party is a disappointing rendition of resignation, which is the futility that ultimately there will never possibly be enough service providers out there and there'll be queues. It just denies the fact that, with the national ice initiative's $685 million and with $10 million directly invested into these trial areas, there will be people screaming for patients. There will be people scrounging around and looking for ice addicts who could possibly receive counselling and treatment. If an MP in this chamber doesn't understand that, they're clearly not connected to their PHN localsâformerly Medicare, a conception of the previous governmentâand the good contracting work they do in my area with after-care in particular, not necessarily primarily focused on drugs but where it is secondary to a mental health issue. They are desperately looking for people to avail themselves of their services. If there is one area for which the coalition could pat themselves on the back, it's these services available through our PHNs all over the country. This complete fiction that there are just no services out there hearkens back to an era when many of us thought the only way to recover from drugs was to go into a Hollywood-style residential facility for 30 days. It's true that that used to be the way it was done; it no longer is. There are very few residential facilities, rightly or wrongly, but it is increasingly hard to prove their cost-effectiveness because they're super expensive and ice is super addictive. They get short-term results, and then people are addicted again, which means their numbers don't look so good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an incredibly hard battle here. If there's one thought that I leave this chamber with, it is that we need to try everything. What you have is a Labor Party desperate to stop us trying everything in our power to take an ice addict and try and break that cycle. They will present, as the member for Oxley did, a young woman, tragically, raped at an early age, who says, 'I live for ice and nothing will ever stop me taking it.' That's the hardest of the hard. I'm not saying it's going to fix every case. We're talking about those right down at the margins, intermittent recreational users, who last year used that excuse nearly 2Â½ thousand times to not show up for work, but they still got paid with taxpayers' money. For those on the margins that are just opting in and out, using ice as a convenient excuse not to workâwe know there are around 85,000 persistent evaders and many of them use drugs and alcohol as an excuseâyour time is up. The holiday is over. We will, through a series of reforms, eventually prevent you leading that life. Maybe not youâmaybe under that roof you've never understood the importance of holding down a job and supporting a family. But all of us will realise that one day, and we don't want to see children damaged while we wait those years for people to come off addiction.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  I'm not speechless, because I'm speaking, but, let me tell you, I've never heard such complete and utter ignorance than what I have just heard from the member opposite. Peoples' lives are complex. The reality is that drugs and alcohol misuse occurs across our community in every sector at every age. I will share some facts that will prove that. It is completely unacceptable that we can stand in this place and trivialise the lives of people whose existence is so complex that it is beyond the ability of most of us to understand. It is simply unfair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to stand in this place today to make my view on this bill very, very clear. I will always welcome genuine and effective efforts to assist and support people who are struggling with drug and alcohol dependency to access appropriate treatment. I don't believe that income support is best utilised to support a drug habit; however, as I have said, peoples' lives are complex. What is very clear to me is that this bill is not a genuine attempt to assist people struggling with drug dependency. It will do nothing to stop the use of illegal drugs, it will do nothing to prevent ongoing drug misuse and it will not deliver appropriate treatment. For people who seek treatment for dependency on drugs, they have to be in a position where they are ready to make change in their lives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes in this bill will have a severe impact on people who have extremely complex lives and needs. The impact of this bill will push them further into serious financial hardship and potentially crime. This bill is based on a misunderstanding of the data which is so full of holes that you could drive a truck through it. I cannot and will not stand in this place and support legislation that will do absolutely nothing to address a serious and complex social problem, a health problem in fact. I cannot believe that in 2018 this government still considers drug testing people on Newstart and youth allowance as a real solution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have all seen the national footage where former Prime Minister Tony Abbott admits to Annabel Crabb that he passed out drunk whilst on the job and by his own admission missed a very important division. Yet, the same person who passed out drunk whilst on the job wants to enforce drug testing on people struggling with drug addictions. This is nothing short of double standards and entitlement. Does the former Prime Minister Tony Abbott not realise the hypocrisy? Does the Turnbull government not see the hypocrisy in this situation? Not to mention the blanket prejudice of assuming that people on youth allowance and Newstart must be the people who are misusing drugs. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A study by the National Centre for Education and Training on Addiction found that drug use is significantly more prevalent among those in the paid workforce in comparison to those not in paid work. Furthermore, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the median age of illicit drug users has risen from 32.8 years in 2001, to 36.5 years in 2013, for any illicit drug. Research has also shown that the numbers of people over 50 years of age are responsible for the largest rise in illicit drug misuse and were the only age group to show a statistically significant increase in misuse. The most common age for illicit drug misuse is 36.5 years of age, but the Turnbull government is choosing to test those on youth allowance, where you have to be under 24 to be eligible. This just does not make sense. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is clear evidence that the Turnbull government doesn't give a damn about vulnerable jobseekers or young people; nor are they interested in assisting people struggling with drug addiction to access treatment. If the Turnbull government was in any way genuine or cared one iota about helping people struggling with drug addiction, they would increase funding into prevention and early intervention programs. Medical professionals, along with the drug and alcohol treatment sector, have raised significant concerns about these measures and the negative impacts that they will have on jobseekers. More importantly, these measures won't be effective in identifying those with a serious problem; nor will they provide them with appropriate treatment options. This is yet another attempt by the Turnbull government to demonise vulnerable job seekers, without any evidence that these measures will work, and it's likely to be a significant cost to the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Experts warn that these changes will not help people to overcome drug misuse; this is not how programs to assist people to address their addiction challenges work. Instead, people will be pushed into crisis, poverty, homelessness and, potentially, crime. And yet the Turnbull government is pushing ahead with its plans to trial the drug testing of around 5,000 welfare recipients at three sites across the country: Logan in Queensland, Canterbury Bankstown in New South Wales and Mandurah in Western Australia. Those who fail a test will be forced onto income management for 24 months. This means that 80 per cent of their welfare payment will be quarantined and can only be spent on specific items. A second failed test will prompt a referral to treatment. Failure to comply with the drug-testing regime could see the welfare recipient lose his or her welfare payment. The proposal has been met with strong opposition from doctors, psychiatrists, welfare advocates, community groups, local mayors, charities and the United Nations. Of course, this approach also assumes that there are drug and alcohol programs available for young people in their communities. Many fear that taking a punitive approach to drug addiction and misuse will simply drive people away from the welfare system and further into poverty. The question must be put to the Turnbull government: where is the evidenceâwhere is the detail? Surely the government should be looking at evidence-based practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overseas examples of drug-testing income support recipients have clearly demonstrated that there is no evidence to support these measures as being effective. In 2013, the New Zealand government instituted a drug-testing program for welfare recipients. In 2015, only 22 of 8,001 participants tested returned a positive result for illicit drug useâthat detection rate was much lower than the proportion of the general New Zealand population estimated to be using illicit drugs. Similar results were found in the United States: in Missouri's 2014 testing program, of the state's 38,970 welfare applicants, 446 were tested with 48 testing positive; and in Utah, of the state's 9,552 welfare participants, 838 were screened with 29 returning a positive result. These were extremely costly initiatives. They are costly initiatives that will drive people further into poverty, homelessness and crimeâyet the Turnbull government is determined to implement this regime with no detail on real costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Concerns have been raised about these measures by health and welfare groups, including St Vincent's Health, the Royal Australian College of Physicians, ACOSS and UnitingCare. No health or community organisations have come out publicly in support of this trial. Addiction medicine specialists are concerned about the technical aspects of the trial. While people taking prescription medicine could be exempted, this would not guarantee that they are not also misusing illicit drugs, thus undermining the purpose of the trial. The testing could potentially encourage people to use less-traceable but more-harmful drugs, such as synthetic cannabis, or to use alcohol, which is not being tested as part of this trial. A long-term cannabis user who is attempting to address their drug misuse will still test positive for up to six weeks. How will Centrelink know if they have actually stopped using cannabis?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government claims that the availability of treatment will be the criteria for selecting trial sites. But Senate estimates revealed that the Commonwealth does not have access to data on the availability of treatment, and will need to rely on the states to provide this information. How is this going to work? For example, if you are a young person tested in Townsville and return a positive test, where would you go? The Salvation Army built a youth detox centre, but they are now struggling to secure funds to operate it. Our youth have to travel to Brisbane or Melbourne, because North Queensland just does not have these facilities. The Turnbull government would not match Labor's initial commitment to fund the Townsville Salvation Army detox centre for young people, and they have not come to the table to fund the operation of the new centre, so there are no services to offer our young people in the north, if the government chooses to run a trial in my community. There are very lengthy waiting lists for treatment around the country. These trials will put increased pressure on the health system and, where treatment is unavailable, jobseekers that are identified as having a drug-misuse problem will have difficulty accessing the necessary treatment. The flaws, gaps and traps in this bill are enormous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But one thing is evident: the Turnbull government don't have a plan to address any real drug misuse issues, but they do have a plan to attack vulnerable jobseekers and to make the poor poorer whilst appearing on the surface to be doing somethingâsomething that delivers nothing more than distress, anxiety and disadvantage. This is a government that don't want to help the sick, as is obvious in the cuts to Medicare. This is a government that don't want equal access to quality education, as is obvious from the savage cuts to education. This is a government that don't want the poor to become middle class, as seen through the cuts to universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you are sick, you should always have access to health care. Where you live shouldn't matter regarding your child's access to a quality needs based education. The size of your wallet or trust fund should not determine whether you can or cannot attend university. When you lose a loved one, someone close to you, you should be allowed time to grieve without fear of not being able to pay for the simple costs of living. But the Turnbull government are completely out of touch with vulnerable citizens, especially in their big talk about supporting the aspirations of Australians. They are not a government of aspiration but rather a government that is hell-bent on making life harder. They are a government that puts aspiration out of reach for some of our most vulnerable citizens. The Turnbull government are a government for the wealthy, not the battler.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To all of those people that the Turnbull government is neglecting I say: you need to know that you matter to the Labor Party and that you matter to me personally. I will fight every minute of every day in this place for you. I will continue to fight against the Turnbull government's savage cuts. I will continue to fight for real action to help people overcome their drug misuse challenges, not rubbish bills like this one. I will continue to fight against the Turnbull government's top hats approach, and I will take up the fight for hard hats. I will continue to fight for jobs in Townsville. I will continue to fight for a fair go for our veterans and ex-service personnel and their families. I will continue to fight for aged care, child care and Medicare, because Labor does care. Labor is the only party that gives people something to aspire to, and that is the opportunity to create a better life for themselves and their children. This bill certainly does not do that. Punishing the most vulnerable at the most difficult time in their life is anything but a solution to get people moving on with their lives.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  Centre Alliance has not changed its position in relation to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing Trial) Bill 2018. Despite it being a scare tactic used by members of the Liberal Party in my community during the recent by-election, we will not back down from our position. The bill before us is a rebadged extract of schedule 12 of the Social Services Legislation (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017, which has already been extensively debated and discussed in both houses of the parliament. The drug-testing component of the welfare reform bill was rejected by both Centre Alliance and the parliament. Yet here we are again, with the government attempting to pass the same piece of legislation using the same completely unsatisfactory policy arguments. We have so much to debate in this place, so I cannot understand why we are expending more time on this when this particular schedule has already been resoundingly rejected by the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my previous speech on the welfare reform bill, I comprehensively detailed my concerns with the drug-testing element of that bill, and just briefly I wish to outline some of the salient arguments once more. The government refuses to publish the cost of the trial to the taxpayer. The government argues there are commercial implications for this nondisclosure. I do not believe this. Government knows exactly how much it intends to spend on this particular pilot study, and it should know how much it intends to spend on this program or pilot study. Every single program should have a dollar figure attached. Publish the costings. Every other program has this. Why not this? In the absence of exceptional circumstances, I and my Centre Alliance colleagues will never support legislation without knowing how much it's going to cost the Australian taxpayer. We believe it is irresponsible, and we believe we would be doing a great disservice to the Australian taxpayer if we did that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think that not detailing those costs is actually quite arrogant, to the parliament and to the Australian taxpayer, who is expected to foot the bill for this policy. I can only assume that this legislation is likely to have a hefty financial cost, given the enormous cost of similar programs in the United States of America. In other jurisdictions, drug testing programs have been proven to be highly ineffective in discovering drug addicts, completely failing any reasonable cost-benefit analysis benchmark. For example, in 2015 research undertaken by the ThinkProgress project of the Center of American Progress discovered that, collectively, 10 US states spent more than US$850,000 on their testing regimes but uncovered only 321 positive tests. In more than one of those American states not a single positive test was found. Based on America's experience, it costs approximately US$2,650 for each positive test secured. How much will it cost us? Experts suggest it will cost us approximately $1,600 per test, per recipient. I'm sure that when we collectively look at how many recipients may test positive the cost will be higher than the US cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we have no information about who will perform these tests and how they will be performed. Will Centrelink recipients be expected to go to the Centrelink office with a specimen cup? Will they be mouth swabbed? Will this be outsourced to a private company? How can we ensure the integrity and the veracity of such testing? We just don't know. Is this the best use of taxpayer funds? Centrelink is already aware of who has a serious drug addiction and who is on welfare with a serious drug addiction, because, until recently, addicts were able to rely on drug addiction as a reasonable excuse when failing to attend job provider appointments. We supported changes to legislation that no longer allowed addiction to be used as an excuse for missed appointments. We supported changes to legislation that meant that Centrelink recipients receiving a working-age payment have one of two pathways to go down. Either they can actively engage and look for work and connect with their jobactive provider, or they must seek rehabilitation to address their addiction if that addiction is stopping them from meaningfully looking for work. These are very important levers that we were keen to support. With this legislation now in place, why would we waste what I can only assume will be millions of taxpayer dollarsâand when we've already tightened the activity requirements?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to raise a serious but often missed point in relation to drug addiction. Existing drug addiction services are utterly swamped. One of the most concerning findings raised during the Senate inquiry into the welfare reform bill was that unmet demand for treatment of addiction in Australia was estimated at between 200,000 and 500,000 Australiansâhalf a million Australians. That is why, in our negotiations with government over the welfare reform bill, we ensured that $40 million of funding was put to one side and provided for specialist drug rehabilitation, including $20 million over three years for specialist methamphetamine rehabilitation facilities in South Australia and $20 million over three years for drug addiction support and training for GPs and other allied health professionals in regional Australia. Good, sound policy analysis showed that there was a significant gap in support at the primary healthcare level for medical professionals, who are often the first and only people that a person with an addiction will go to to seek assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we have millions to spare on this random drug testingâand we still don't know how much it isâthen more money should be put into addiction services. Let me be clear: Centre Alliance believes that people who are on jobseeker payments should not be allowed to sit and do nothing. This is why we supported an amended welfare reform bill. Centre Alliance believes that jobseekers should be either actively engaged in jobseeking or actively engaged in becoming job-ready, and that would mean addressing their addictions. In the case of a person with a drug addiction, this means engaging in drug rehabilitation, getting counselling and in some cases going into a rehab bed. We believed it was right and we believed it was responsible. However, what we have before us today is really poor policy formation. There is no clarity of cost or of expected outcomes, and we have already changed the legislation to deal with people with addiction. Let's face it: if the US have abandoned their drug testing, we need to learn from them. Why would we go down the same path? The US has far more populist politics than we do. Surely we can learn from them. I believe this is a crude attempt to demonise people receiving Centrelink payments. We do have long-term unemployed in Australia, but for the most part they are older Australians completing job application after job application. We also know that there is a one-to-16 ratio of jobs to jobseekers. That is what we should be addressing. In conclusion, the drug-testing trial bill is but a populist piece of legislation. I call upon the parliament to once again oppose this flawed piece of legislation. We cannot afford to waste more taxpayer money on this.</span>

It's almost a sense of deja vu, but, like a bad smell, here we are back again. I hope that, when the Senate again does its work, this bill will be well on the way to becoming another one of those zombie bills that hang around on the government's <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> going nowhere. It's called the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing Trial) Bill 2018. You could just be honest and call it the 'drive up crime' bill. That's what a former Australian Federal Police commissioner said this bill will do. You still can't find one single credible expert that says this bill will do anything meaningful to address drug addiction. It will just demonise people on welfare, which serves your political purpose. We know that well, having lived through the by-elections with the rubbish and the bile that you spew out in communities. All it will do is drive up crime, and you know it. You haven't taken advice. You didn't take advice from the health minister. You have no experts on your side. It's just brain-dead prejudice.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just precis my speech from last time this was before the House. Drug addiction is a health issue. It's a health issue. It's a health issue! Addiction must be treated like a health issue, like other health issues. The evidence is clear: making it a moral issue does not help. It might make you feel good in your Liberal partyroom meeting, Government, but it doesn't actually help anyone in the community suffering from addiction. Addiction cuts across every class and hits every suburb and every family in this country. Last time I spoke I outlined in deeply personal ways how my family's story in life has been touched by addiction. They're not all my stories to share, and I said as much as I could. I also outlined my experience in my 20s, as the mayor and leader of an inner-city council where the heroin epidemic saw people dying every day, every week around the city, in shops, in front yards, in laneways. The evidence then remains true: criminalising or demonising someone's addiction, whether or not they need income support, doesn't actually help. The Prime Minister's absurd claim that this is a policy born of love is ridiculous, especially with the lack of real funding for rehabilitation.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting" style="font-weight:bold;">):</span>  The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing Trial) Bill 2018 introduces a two-year trial of drug testing for illicit drug use of 5,000 new recipients of Newstart Allowance and youth allowance in three trial sites. This trial is designed to identify and help jobseekers who have drug-abuse issues. It will help them to get treatment, to rehabilitate and to get a job. During the first year of the trial, 5,000 new jobseekers in three locations across Australia will be selected randomly and tested for the presence of illicit drugs. The trial will operate in Canterbury Bankstown, New South Wales; Logan, Queensland, and Mandurah, Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The community has the right to expect that taxpayer funded welfare payments are not being used to fund drug addiction and that jobseekers do all they can to find a job. We don't want our welfare system subsidising drug dealers. It is important to note that people who fail a drug test will not lose one dollar of welfare money. What will happen is that 80 per cent of their welfare money will be put on income management. This involving direct debits for rent and utilities, with the remainder put on the BasicsCard, which can be spent on essentials like rent and groceries. On a second failure, they will be referred for a medical assessment and rehabilitation may be added to their job plan. The only time someone will lose their welfare payment directly is if they refuse to take a drug test. People who refuse to take part in the trial when signing on for income support will not get a welfare payment. To support jobseekers in the drug-testing trial, the government has also announced an additional $10 million treatment fund. The treatment fund will assist people to undertake the treatment recommended for them by a medical professional should existing Commonwealth or state funded services not be able to meet any additional demand as a result of the trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill demonstrates the government's commitment to the drug-testing trial, which is a unique and innovative approach to helping people with drug-abuse issues. The government believes that randomised drug testing can be an effective way of identifying welfare recipients for whom mandated treatments may be successful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This trial is a world first; nothing like it has been attempted anywhere else. A comprehensive evaluation will be conducted in parallel with the trial. This approach will ensure that any unintended consequences can be identified promptly and addressed in real time. The evaluation will build a body of evidence on the efficacy of this unique protocol, where jobseekers with drug-abuse issues will receive income management and be supported to access treatment. This government's measure is designed to help identify jobseekers for whom drug use is an issue. The purpose of testing welfare recipients in the drug-testing trial is to find people who may need help to address a barrier to employment that they may not have acknowledged or disclosed previously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This trial is one of a suite of measures to address drug and alcohol abuse issues in welfare recipients that the government announced in the 2017-18 budget. These measures are designed to work together and to better encourage and support these jobseekers to take reasonable steps to overcome their issues and find work. From 1 January 2018, for the first time all jobseekers are able to include drug and alcohol treatment in their job plan and have this contribute to meeting their annual activity requirement. This measure supports jobseekers with drug and alcohol abuse issues and allows them to have a job plan that is properly tailored to their needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also passed measures to ensure that jobseekers with substance abuse issues remain actively engaged in appropriate activities, including treatment, to address their barriers to work. Jobseekers will no longer be granted an exemption from their mutual obligation requirements, including activities such as job search and preparing for work, due to drug or alcohol abuse issues. Instead, they will remain connected with their employment services provider. Seeking an exemption on these grounds will trigger a conversation with their provider about their drug or alcohol issues and enable their activities to be tailored to address their needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this, the government has passed measures to tighten the reasonable excuse rules and prevent jobseekers from repeatedly using drug and alcohol dependency as an excuse for not meeting their requirements without being prepared to do anything about it. Indeed, they will be encouraged to undertake treatment as part of their mutual obligation requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The drug-testing trial will test an innovative method of assisting people with drug abuse issues. We know that drug use can be a major barrier to finding and keeping a job. The government believes that helping jobseekers to get the treatment that they need to overcome their drug abuse issues is a critical step in ensuring that these Australians benefit from the 1,100 new jobs that are being created.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in reviewing the bill the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has recommended some clarification to the explanatory memorandum regarding risk profiling. I now table the addendum to the explanatory memorandum that makes that clarification. I recommend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  The Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Act was introduced in 2012 as part of a suite reforms designed to provide the Australian shipping industry with a stable framework and indeed to encourage further investment. Unfortunately that has not been the case. Since implementation of the current framework, the decline in the number of Australian flagged vessels has unfortunately continued. The reality at the moment is that many ageing Australian registered vessels are not being replaced. The sector is ostensibly in decline. This bill was intended to balance the interests of the Australian shipping industry and users of shipping services by regulating Australian and foreign flagged ships through a licensing system. Unfortunately this simply hasn't happened. Australian businesses have faced such significant issues accessing coastal shipping that they've given up and frankly started sending their products by road or rail. Something has to change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My particular interest in the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Amendment Bill 2017, notwithstanding the important areas of coastal shipping, has to do with the framework regarding superyachts, however, because this bill also supports an increase in visits to Australia by superyachts. The current coastal trading framework makes it difficult, indeed almost impossible, for foreign flagged superyachts to offer charter services in Australia, which they would like to undertake to defray the cost of operations. This bill makes changes to the coastal trading act that better align the framework with the operating model for superyachts, allowing a single voyage application, and departure and return to the same port. These minor changes should make coming to Australia more attractive for superyachts and increase job opportunities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately most superyachts go to Fiji or New Zealand because of customs importation duty and taxes. A one-voyage minimum requirement will allow superyachts to operate under the licensing system and obtain exemption from the current Customs Act and not pay duty. The drama of course at present is that, when a superyacht wishes to visit, it literally has to be imported, and a cost of 10 per cent of its total cost is applied to it. Clearly, no yacht is going to come here and do that if that's the cost of them having to charter. Therefore, Australia misses out on an entire opportunity to enhance the business of sailing in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Opening Australia to the superyacht market will bring important trade and tourism benefits not only to areas of the Gold Coast, where I live, but to rural and regional areas in Far North Queensland. Small businesses in Cairns, the Whitsundays and Port Douglas, amongst others, will benefit greatly from it. In 2016, Superyacht Australia and the Queensland Treasury commissioned an economic impact study of the superyacht sector for the Queensland Labor government. The Queensland Superyacht Strategy envisages that, by 2023, Queensland's share of the global superyacht industry will have increased by 10 per cent and Queensland will be recognised as a key superyacht hub in the Asia-Pacific region. This can only happen if we make these changes. This growth would create thousands and thousands of new high-skilled jobs and contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars to the state's economy. The Queensland state Labor government support this inclusion, and they have come out publicly to support it. It's easy to see why they support it. Looking at the economic benefit alone, the ability for yachts to charter simply by taking away this customs impost on them will add an additional 11,800 jobs and $1.64 billion by 2021. This is the Queensland state Labor government's modelling, not this government's. The Queensland state Labor government is calling on the opposition to join us in this. The huge events in the Pacific over the next three years will mean a large number of superyachts will be in our region. There is the Rugby World Cup in Japan in 2019, the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 and the America's Cup in Auckland in 2021. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no loss of GST for the government. This is despite the member for Sydney's ridiculous question before the winter break about us somehow not wanting superyachts to pay GST but GST being on tampons, like the two are aligned in any way, shape or form, when this couldn't be further from the truth. This is an issue of a 10 per cent impost through customs duty, nothing more, nothing less. The dear member for Sydney simply didn't understand what she was talking about. There's no loss of GST for the government. Indeed, current foreign superyachts come in under a control permit and don't pay any taxes at all. Permitting charter will actually see the government receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in GST. It's actually the opposite of what the member for Sydney had said. Removing this customs restriction allows yachts to come in to charter, and GST will be charged and earnt, which currently is not the case. It's a win-win all around, something the Queensland state Labor government seems to understand. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians dominate the industry, with over a quarter of the world's crew being Australians. By supporting superyacht charters in Australia, we'll be supporting over 14,000 crew, new-age, highly skilled and well-paid seafarersâand 25 per cent of them are Australians. Tradesmen and small businesses are the huge winners from superyachts spending time in Australia, with each vessel spending millions of dollars, or 10 to12 per cent of the vessel's value, annually in maintenance and provisions directly intoâpredominantlyâsmall family-owned businesses or small businesses with union membership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">New Zealand, Fiji and Tahiti all have booming superyacht industries dominated by charter vessels. Australia needs to permit charter to allow a similar boom in our industry here, along with the thousands of skilled trade jobs and economic benefits that come with it. Regions that have a high level of charter activity receive substantial international marketing exposure, which then encourages further investment in locally based vessels, infrastructure and repair facilities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're talking about an industry valued at just below $2 billion to Australia. If we were to make this simple change, the annual maintenance value of what is possible is $575 million in operational expenses. Currently we're earning nothing; it could be $415 million. The number of Australian maritime jobs could be well over 11,000. The total annual wages and salaries that would derive from this would be $1.2 billion. These are Queensland state Labor government figures from its study with the superyacht industry. All we need to do is make some simple changes to stop this ridiculous customs duty impost on vessels. At present, we're getting nothing. We have the opportunity to envisage an industry that is alive and growing, an industry to support 14,000 young Australians on these boats, an industry that will see over 11,000 Australians employed in high-tech areas to support these vessels, and the government earning GST on the charter of these vessels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a little bit of a no-brainer: the opportunity to build an industry we don't have. And what makes it so frustrating is that every other country in the region has moved away from these custom import tariffs. We are the sole bastion of stupidity in the Pacific, where we alone are saying, 'If you come here, your boat has to be imported, and if you wish to charter, you've got to pay 10 per cent of the value of your yacht before you can charter.' So when the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dragonfly</span> came inâthe fastest superyacht in the worldânot only did it take a month of negotiation to get it in, but, when it came in, it couldn't charterâbecause if it had wanted to, it would have had to pay 10 per cent of its value. For an $80 million yacht, that's $8 million for the purpose of chartering: ridiculous! So it didn't charter. And if they can't charter to defray costs, they don't come here for repair and maintenance, so we lose out on an entire industry because of a nonsense of a customs regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the love of all that is sacred, can we all just look at this, and not with the eyes of envy as the member for Sydney didâso ridiculously, so stupendouslyâat question time before we came in here; not understanding what she was talking about, running off at the mouth, linking superyachts somehow as some enviable thing compared to tampons, which is the current great issue of GST. Can we look at this in the cold light of day: what is actually sensible? It's a customs impost. Remove it. Let's allow an industry to grow. Let's allow 11,000 high-tech workers to be employed. Let's allow GST to be collected when these yachts charter. Let's do something sensible on this. We've been talking about this for years, and we are nowhere. This is such a no-brainer, and it is supported publicly by the Labor state government in Queensland. Can we just get this particular thing done?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:59</span>):  Today I rise to speak to the House about the Australian shipping industry; in particular, the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Amendment Bill 2017. Maritime security is critical to the economy and to our national interest. As an island nation with such a strong maritime history, the federal government has a responsibility to maintain our capabilities in this area. However, unfortunately, this government has consistently shown no such regard for Australian shipping and shipowners, and continues its attempts to force through legislation that would compromise their ability to compete with foreign vessels and undermine our national maritime capabilities. Labor knows how important shipping is to this country. That's why we developed and passed the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Bill in 2012, and that's why we've opposed this government's repeated attempts to degrade its protection of the Australian maritime industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill offers a raft of measures that will make it easier for foreign flagged vessels to operate in Australian waters, while providing absolutely nothing for Australian flagged vessels. The proposal before the House would increase tolerance limits from their current level of plus or minus 20 per cent of the nominated cargo or passenger volumes to 200 per cent more or 100 per cent less. It would also change the current loading window from plus or minus five days to 30 days either side of the authorised date. This drastic increase of volume tolerance limits and loading windows would make it impossible for Australian owned and operated ships that hold general licences to compete with foreign vessels holding temporary licences. These provisions would, according to the Maritime Union of Australia, totally undermine accepted commercial arrangements and make it impossible for a general licence holder to contest a cargo, as a general licence holder would not know what they were contesting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Maritime Industry Australia Limited, which is the peak industry group for Australian shippers, also opposes these changes, claiming that the integrity of the system is undermined, as general licence holders' rights and opportunities are reduced. They go on to state that without tolerances being meaningful the system may as well be deregulated entirely. The Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers has stated that under these proposals the ultimate voyage carried out may bear no resemblance to the original voyage for which the temporary licence was granted, and AIMPE opposes these proposals. One of the biggest shipping groups in this country, CSL, says of this legislation that 'the current date tolerance seems unreasonable', and True North Adventure Cruises, a tourism operator off north-western Australia, has warned that the proposed changes would allow foreign operators to game the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This overwhelming chorus of opposition from key stakeholders reflects the dangers of these proposals to the future of Australian shipping and maritime capabilities. These proposals will not see one extra Australian job in our maritime industry or put one extra Australian flagged ship on our coast. Until we see something different from this governmentâsomething that allows Australian shipping to stay competitive both now and into the futureâthe Labor Party will continue to oppose these reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has form on this issue. This government has tried this before, and the response from stakeholders was clear. The only way forward for shipping in this country is a policy that is founded on proper consultation and has bipartisan support. The minister has himself acknowledged this, claiming in his own discussion paper that another key message from my recent stakeholder consultations is that regulatory certainty, ideally bipartisanship, is essential for investment. I would implore the government to go back to their drawing board and listen to the industry and stakeholders and follow a proper consultation process, just as Labor did when we created the original legislation and came back to the House with something that puts Australian jobs first and Australian workers first.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately the government's record in this area is dismal reading. I recall their previous attempts, in 2015, to tear down the Australian shipping industryâand I don't say those words lightly. They were intending to destroy the Australian shipping industry. You don't have to take my word for it. You only have to read the regulatory impact statements that accompanied the 2015 legislation, stating in black and white that under their proposition 1,000 of the 1,100 workers employed in the industry would be sacked as a result of this legislation. Let me repeat that: the RIS for the 2015 bill stated that more than 90 per cent of the Australian maritime workforce would be put out of work under plans put forward by this government. Rarely has a government been so incompetentâor maybe so startlingly honestâas to say that their legislation would result in 90 per cent of an industry's workforce being sacked. Yet this is what this government attempted in 2015, and what we see now is a watered-down attempt at the same thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the coastal shipping laws that Labor put in place created a level playing field, requiring that Australian wages and conditions be observed if ships are here for a certain amount of time. Let me repeat a simple premise: if a ship were here for a certain amount of time, it would have to pay Australian wages and conditionsânot an unreasonable thing. If someone wants to truck goods down an Australian highway, they have to pay Australian wages and conditions. Why is it different for the blue-water highway? If a ship works the Australian coastal trading route for a reasonable amount of time, it should have to pay Australian wages and honour Australian conditions. Anything else is an attack on Australian workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill in 2015 was essentially Work Choices on water, the driving down of wages and conditions to Third World standards. What we were talking about then and what we are back to argue for today is maintaining Labor's record and regulations in this space. We're not taking an extreme position on this. In fact, Australia has one of the most liberal coasting trading regimes in the world. The rest of our G20 partners have much more restrictive policies in this area than we do, including Japan, the United Kingdom and most European countries. Even China has closed shipping lanes. The United States, the supposed bastion of the free market and free trade, has the Jones Act which legislates that all ships that service the US coastal shipping route must hire American seafarers and must pay US wages and conditions. In fact, the ships must be built in the United States. Yet this government, time and time again, tries to drag us the other way, to the detriment of the national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill represents yet another in a sequence of attacks on coastal shipping in this country under the Turnbull government. It is a shameful record of attacks on the maritime industry and the proud and skilled workforce that service that industry. We saw this when 30 security guards boarded Alcoa's ship the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Portland</span> in the middle of the night to remove five Australian crew that were protesting their sacking. The security personnel then brought aboard a foreign crew who sailed the ship immediately for Singapore. The sacking of 40 Australian workers who staffed this vessel right before Christmas was bad enough, but to employ such tactics to get rid of this issue in the middle of the night was worse still. This midnight guerrilla raid marked the low point for Australian shipping at the time, and this government has continued to oversee the degradation of Australian coastal shipping since then. In fact, a few months after the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Portland</span> incident, the Turnbull government issued a temporary licence to Pacific Aluminium for 30 voyages in 2016, which allowed them to sack the crew of the CSL <span style="font-style:italic;">Melbourne</span> and bring in a Greek owned ship travelling under a flag of convenience. A foreign ship replaced an Australian vessel and a foreign crew replaced Australian workers, with no regulation or standards regarding their wages or working conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These were ships that had been doing regular trade and employing Australian workers for a long time. The CSL <span style="font-style:italic;">Melbourne</span> had been running alumina on the east coast for over five years, while the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Portland</span> had been shipping alumina from Western Australia to Portland's aluminium smelter for 27 years. These were well-established, longstanding Australian shipping lanes which employed Australian maritime workers and supported Australian industry. Now all this has been replaced by fraudulent temporary licensing and foreign crews with unknown working conditions, and the government wants to expand this model further. This was not temporary trade. This was regular trade. This was a trade that had been undertaken for 27 years, as predictable as night following day, shipping alumina from the refineries to the aluminium smelters. Yet this government issued temporary licences that allowed Australian crews to be sacked and to be frogmarched off the ships in the middle of the night, replaced by crews who were exploited and paid $2 a day. That is wholly unacceptable, but this is the attitude of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It paints a sorry picture of the future of coastal shipping in Australia that will have consequences not just for our workers but for the nation as a whole. Maritime infrastructure and workers are not just economically vital; they also represent a core pillar of our national security. To protect our borders and ensure the safety of all Australians, we must maintain not only a strong shipbuilding sector, including maintenance and repair, but also a strong merchant navy. History has shown time after time that these capabilities are crucial to our national interest, regional security and participation in the international community. Going forward, we must look not just to protect our maritime systems but also to improve and strengthen them so as to remain not only competitive but also secure. We are an island nation. We need a skilled merchant marine if we are to maintain our national sovereignty. It is important to acknowledge at this time that the Merchant Navy had the highest casualty rate in World War II, after Bomber Command. These are highly skilled and dangerous jobs in wartime, and we need a skilled Australian workforce to maintain that capability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the economic security and social benefits of a strong Australian shipping industry, there are tangible environmental benefits. In my region, and across the nation as a whole, we've seen that foreign vessels, when compared to domestic operators, show less regard for environmental protections in force in Australian waters. Whether it is the preservation of national icons such as the Great Barrier Reef, or ships ignoring port authorities to disastrous effect, like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Pasha Bulker</span> in my home region of the Hunter, it is clear that an increase in the number of foreign vessels is dangerous to our maritime and coastal environment. Time after time, we have seen the results when foreign flagged vessels ignore environmental regulations, whether they run aground on the Great Barrier Reef or, as in 2007, when the crew of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Pasha Bulker</span> ignored the requirements to move further offshore, wash up on Nobbys Beach in Newcastle. If we allow foreign flagged vessels to dominate our coastal trading, we are risking our national environmental icons. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond our natural heritage areas and their associated beauty, there is a direct economic impact. The attractions of the Great Barrier Reef mean employment for 68,000 Australians in the tourism industry and drive $9 billion of gross domestic product each year. The maritime industry also provides security for workers across this country, from Fremantle to Adelaide and Melbourne, and right up and down the east coast. This bill would place workers in tourism, shipping, shipbuilding, maintenance and other related industries in an uncertain and unacceptable situation. We have seen enough examples of the poor conditions and wages afforded to workers on foreign flagged vessels to know that we must do whatever it takes to ensure that hardworking Australians are not forced into these situations. In fact, the last time the government tried to overhaul this legislation, the Senate heard that changing the law to favour foreign flagged vessels would result in catastrophic job losses across the sector and a significant drop in wage and workplace standards, and that any regulatory savings claimed would be built on the back of those. The government is again looking out for big multinationals and leaving Australian workers in the lurch.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because I have an electorate that is on the coast, with the Pacific Ocean on our eastern border and the great Lake Macquarie, Lake Munmorah and Budgewoi Lake on the western border of the electorate, it has many seafarers, both those who are employed and those who are out of work. When I have a mobile office, I meet seafarers who haven't been able to find jobs for years on end because of this government's neglect of the industry. It does not have to be that way. We should have Australian crews on Australian ships on Australian coastal trading routes who are paid Australian wages and are under Australian conditions. That is what every other advanced nation in the world does. The fact that we do not do that is a horrible indictment of this governmentâa government that, yet again, is betraying workers and compromising the maritime security and the environmental integrity of this nation when there are foreign crews on flag-of-convenience ships being paid $2 a day. It is unacceptable.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265967" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:14</span>):  I rise to support this bill, the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Amendment Bill 2017, which I believe will have significant benefits for my own electorate of Fisher. In particular, I believe that, as one of the nation's premier coastal tourist destinations, Fisher, along with other coastal regions in Australia, will benefit substantially from the additional tourism generated by the changes proposed to the regulation of superyachts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I do believe that my community of Fisher has been too dependent until now on the tourism and construction sectors, I also firmly believe that attracting tourists will always remain one of the central pillars of our region's economic success. After all, the southern and central Sunshine Coast is undoubtedly the greatest tourism destination in Australia. There is nowhere in our country, perhaps in the world, that can boast our unique combination of natural assets and our unbeatable lifestyle, and I'm committed to doing all I can to support and grow tourism in Fisher. Tourist numbers on the coast have been growing strongly, with international visitors up 20 per cent over the past three years. However, unfortunately, the average spend per visitor has not been increasing at the same rate. We need to do more to encourage high-net-worth visitors to Fisher who will spend big in our local businesses. One way that we can achieve that end would be to encourage more international superyachts to visit our community and to stay for longer. We have the perfect place in Fisher for these vessels to begin and end their cruises. That is at the Mooloolaba Spit, where facilities like the Browns Slipway operated today by the Rockliff family could offer just the place for these yachts to be maintained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Superyachts fall into two broad categories. Some are operated by companies solely as charter businesses. They travel from port to port, picking up clients and taking them on short cruises. Others are owned by a wealthy individual or individuals, families or corporations and are primarily intended for private use. However, these too can often be chartered. When the owner has stopped at a port or during times when the yacht is travelling independently and the owner is otherwise occupied, the yacht is often made available to others to charter for short cruises. Each of these charter types can bring significant economic benefits to a particular region. For privately owned yachts which are being used by a wealthy individual or group of individuals, the presence alone of those people in a region can bring material benefits in terms of the money spent during their stay. In general, the longer the stay, the more money these individuals spend. If commercial charter opportunities are available for these yachts during their owners' visit, it will encourage them to remain longer within a region and spend more money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the very possibility of commercial charter opportunities will often make a port more attractive to owners, making it more likely that they will choose that particular city as a destination. In the case of yachts owned by companies purely as charter vessels, there are still substantial benefits to a local economy when yachts choose to operate from their port. On the one hand, the fact that a particular yacht is going to be available for charter from a port is often a strong draw to that place for high-net-worth individuals. Though primarily travelling in order to undertake the cruise, those visitors will commonly spend additional time in that city, bringing valuable tourism dollars to the local economy. However, the tourism benefits of the presence of these yachts to a community like Fisher goes beyond the income generated directly by the people who undertake the cruise. The word-of-mouth advertising created by these well-connected people can bring many more high-value tourists, while, for some, the perceived glamour of these vessels in itself can increase the attractiveness of a tourist destination. For many of the more than 300,000 people who visit the tiny city of Monaco every year, it is the image of rows of large luxury yachts and the glamour with which they are associated that make up a substantial part of the reason for going.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in both cases, the additional time that a yacht spends in a particular port due to its being available for charter substantially increases the likelihood that the vessel will undergo maintenance and repair at that very location. With some of the largest of these yachts costing millions of dollars to repair, the income generated by this activity can be significant. In February this year, for example, a single superyacht, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dragonfly</span>, docked at Gold Coast City Marina in Queensland for what was reported in the media to be more than $1 million worth of repairs and upgrades. However, a community like my own electorate of Fisher does not necessarily need a repair and dry dock facility to benefit from the maintenance required by superyachts. A ship which is charted requires supplies like food and consumables, fresh water and fuel. The longer a yacht stays in a port the more likely it will be to spend on these supplies and the more revenue generated for producers and dock facilities like those in Mooloolaba.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A December 2016 analysis by AEC Group, commissioned by Superyacht Australia and the Queensland Treasury, found that in total the superyacht industry already contributes about $590 million directly to Australian GDP, with $1.38 billion in flow-on activity. One hundred and ninety million dollars per annum is already generated by foreign tourists and crew expenditure, which would otherwise not have occurred in the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In total, more than 14,500 jobs are supported by superyachts and their supply chains. However, worldwide and particularly in our region, the demand for superyacht activities is increasing. With the growing class of wealthy individuals in China and Asia, along with economic development in other countries in the region and increasingly saturated waterways in Europe and the Caribbean, more and more people are interested in superyacht cruising in the Asia-Pacific. Countries in our region, such as New Zealand, Fiji and Tahiti have moved to make their regulatory and taxation regimes more encouraging to superyacht visits, and as a result are currently set to reap most of the benefits of this growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, while many yachts visit Australian waters to see the Great Barrier Reef, far too few stop to enjoy the hospitality of our coastal communities. As such, at present the superyacht sector's annual contribution to the Australian economy is forecast to grow at a rate of 13 per cent to 2021. However, if we can reduce the regulatory barriers which discourage visits from these vessels, the industry modelling suggests that this contribution will grow by as much as 70 per cent over the same period, delivering a total economic revenue of $3.34 billion by 2021 and supporting 8,100 more jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My own state of Queensland would be likely to be a particular beneficiary with our share of the global superyacht sector increasing by 10 per cent, contributing more than $1.1 billion to gross state product. It is just that reduction in regulatory barriers which this bill will achieve, and for that reason I believe it will make an important contribution to growing tourism income on the Sunshine Coast.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our region, superyachts are charted for one or two voyages at a time. The number of individuals or organisations who have the financial means and the time to charter such a large vessel are certainly finite and their needs are often very specific. A voyage on a superyacht for most personal and corporate users is a very occasional activity with a particular purpose. As such, as these vessels move around the world they often stop off at a port for a single charter. However, at present in order to acquire a temporary licence to conduct coastal trading in Australia a superyacht must have a minimum of five specific voyages booked and listed on its application. Without a temporary licence an owner looking to offer their yacht for charter in Australia faces enormous costs associated with paying customs importation duty and taxes on these vessels. Any subsequent changes to these voyages need to go through a lengthy and uncertain variation process in order to go ahead. This bill removes that unnecessary, ridiculous government red tape, making it possible for a yacht to acquire a temporary licence in the much more likely scenario that it has one or two charter voyages planned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, it is obviously in the nature of cruises for pleasure that many of them begin and end in the same port. These are not practical journeys designed to get a person from one place to another but short visits to a particular location, or simple round trip experiences, to be enjoyed. However, at present, to constitute a voyage for which a temporary licence can be acquired under the coastal trading act, a trip must begin and end in a different port. This renders ineligible a substantial proportion of superyacht cruises which could take place from ports like Mooloolaba. This bill removes that restriction by broadening the definition of a voyage under the act to include those which begin and end in the same port.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, at present, the amount of refitting and maintenance of foreign flagged yachts that can be undertaken in Australia is limited by the fact that dry-docking is not included among the activities eligible for a temporary licence. Once again, this bill removes that restriction, meaning that more vessels will be refitted and maintained in Australia. This will potentially bring millions of dollars to the communities where repairs take place and further increase the number of tourists who visit all of our coastal regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only will this bill's amendments to the regulations regarding temporary licences improve our country's attractiveness to superyachts, but the minister and my colleagues have laid out a wide range of other benefits that will flow from this legislation. However, for communities like mine in Fisher and for coastal regions all over Australia, the billions of extra tourism dollars which will be generated by these luxury vessels are reason enough to enact the bill before us. I note that even the Queensland state Labor government have recognised the importance of these changes, and I welcome their support for the growth of superyacht visitation to our state. I would encourage members opposite to follow their Queensland colleagues in this matter and support the Turnbull government's practical and considered action to make the most of our nation's natural assets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is not about some form of class warfare. What is important to me is that this bill is about providing jobs to regional Australian communities. If those opposite are fair dinkum about Australian workers, they should be supporting this bill. This bill is not, as the member for Sydney would suggest it is, for the rich and famous, to advantage them. This bill will provide jobs to hardworking Australians. It will provide jobs in the maintenance sector. So often this is a sector which is doing it tough in shipping. I know that in and around Mooloolaba, where I live, the coastal fishing vessels are certainly doing it very tough. What happens with these areas is that, when one boat leaves a particular fishery, another boat might leave and then another boat might leave, and then we see infrastructure start to crumble, because infrastructure requires a certain degree of mass and, when boats leave, infrastructure also leaves with it. This bill will enable the infrastructure for marine vessels to remain in ports like Mooloolaba in my electorate of Fisher and throughout the coastal parts of Australia. It will mean jobs. It will mean towns will be able to provide for their communities. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEAY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  On another topic, I want to put on the record my deep and sincere thanks to the people of Braddon for giving me the opportunity to return today to the federal parliament. It is a tremendous privilege and honour to be re-elected as the federal member for Braddon, representing my region and our community. I want to thank and commend the candidates who put their names forward to contest the by-election, but this was never about me. It was about giving the people of Braddon an opportunity to tell the nation who we are, our priorities and what we expect from a federal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would not be standing here today without the exceptional team and hard work of the Labor movement. I wish to thank so very much the Leader of the Opposition and the deputy leader for their support, mentoring and commitment to me and the people of Braddon. To the entire team of shadow ministers and colleagues, thank you for your support. Unlike the government, Labor's leadership team and shadow ministry spent time in my electorate before the by-election and therefore had a great understanding of the people and communities of Braddon. Our commitments and priorities reflect this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to my Tasmanian colleagues. We Tasmanians make a formidable team. Many cower in the doorways of parliament when they see the Tasmanian contingent coming down the corridors. We are now just as formidable as before. Thank you also to the talented and committed team from the leader's office and the equally amazing team from the ALP: thank you, Noah Carrol, Paul Erickson, Sebastian Zwalf and Stuart Benson. A huge thanks to the industrial wing of the Labor movement, led by Jessica Mundy from Unions Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give a special mention to the magnificent Maritime Union of Australia. The MUA is part of me. My dad was a seafarer and a union man, who sadly passed away at sea when I was quite young. The MUA and the maritime industry supported my family after this time. Again, when facing this by-election challenge, the MUA were there. Thank you to Paddy Crumlin, Ian Bray, Jason Campbell, Alisha Bull, Darrin Barnett and Michelle Myers, who are in the gallery today. I also want to thank our local unions and their leadership: Madeleine Northam from the CPSU, who is here; John Short from the AMWU; Tim Jacobson from HACSU; Paul Griffin from the SDA; and Jeanette Armstrong from United Voice. Our union comrades campaigned during this by-election on matters of inequality and fairness, a message that resonated very well in our electorate, where so many are feeling left behind by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally I must thank the magnificent field and operations teams and all the volunteers. There are too many to name individually. I would love to do so, but I have a short time here today. These people doorknocked, phone banked, worked on polling day in some of Tasmania's most exceptional weather, had a sign or simply had conversations with their neighbours. They took time away from their families, friends and homes to be part of this campaign, and I am truly thankful. There is something unique about doorknocking in the howling gale, pouring rain and freezing temperatures that many volunteers were able to experience over many, many weeks. This was the ultimate team effort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The circumstances of the Braddon by-election will almost probably never be repeated. For 11 weeks, Braddon voters were given a choice between two policy propositions: tax cuts for the top end of town at the expense of funding for our hospitals and schools or, as Labor's alternative, increasing investment in schools, hospitals, TAFE and much, much more. Not once did my Liberal opponent, when asked numerous times, explain why a tax cut for the banks is a good thing for the people of Braddon. Perhaps he couldn't or just wouldn't. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Braddon sent this Liberal government a very clear message: dump your corporate tax cuts for big business and the banks. If you don't, it is at your peril. This Liberal government's priority is the wrong priority for my community and the nation, but ultimately Labor's priorities are what the people in Braddon support and what I will take to them at the general election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This campaign, where everything was thrown at me and Labor, was a tough one. While I and my electorate judged my Liberal opponent on his record, found in black and white, the negative and defamatory attacks on me by my opponent and the dirty political tactics faced by an Independent candidate were not what the people of Braddon accepted. These dirty, negative tactics backfired. This style of politics cannot continue, in the interests of our voters and in the interests of attracting outstanding candidates. After going through this campaign, I now feel I can do just about anything. I am a better person and a better parliamentarian. I am truly honoured and privileged to represent the people of Braddon. I will fight for them every single day, as long as they will have me. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="7K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ENTSCH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I rise tonight to talk about a much-loved community asset in my electorate, the Rondo Theatre. Founded in 1953, the Cairns Little Theatre is a community driven, incorporated amateur theatrical company, whose charter is to choose, produce and stage the works of the finest Australian and international playwrights in a professional manner for the training, benefit and appreciation of its members at all levels, of students and of the theatre-going public. From its foundation, the Cairns Little Theatre continuously presented an annual program of plays in community halls in the Hartley Street Theatre and in the Cairns Civic Theatre, until the Rondo Theatre was commissioned in 1983. A season of plays at the Rondo has become established as a regular feature of the theatre calendar in Far North Queensland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the theatre urgently requires major upgrades to bring the theatre's lighting and audio systems up to 21st century standards and to address the safety concerns due ageing electrical infrastructure. The first stage of the project has already been funded through the Cairns Regional Council Arts and Cultural Infrastructure Program, which provided $50,000 towards the purchase of equipment and the truss framework. They already have this equipment and are ready to work on the installation of electrical renovation, including revamped surround sound and modern LED lights to replace the old halogen fixtures. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the winter recess, I met with the Cairns Little Theatre president, Kevin Shorey, who showed me the extent of the works required. To protect all of this good electoral work, they must also complete work on the building itself, after technicians found that there were ceiling and related structural issues that must be addressed immediately. The works are extensive. Initially, they were looking at a cost of around $187,000 to complete the works, but I would suggest that that figure is now around the $200,000 mark in order to fix the water damage in the ceiling so as to make sure it doesn't impact on the new electrical systems that they need to install.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have promised Mr Shorey that I will be banging on each and every door this week in Canberra to see if I can secure this funding for them. I know my colleagues here will be cowering at the thought of me banging on their doors, but this theatre means so much to my community and cannot be allowed to slide into disrepair. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cairns is the home of some of the nation's most thriving arts communities, and the Rondo Theatre is an absolutely integral part of that. In fact, as of June 2017, there were 819 businesses within the cultural and creative industries in my electorate of Leichhardt. Furthermore, some 2,191 people are employed across cultural and creative occupations in my electorate. So, as you can see, Mr Speaker, the arts community is a very significant part of our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Rondo is part of the amateur theatres that we have there, but we also have coming online very shortly the new Cairns Theatreâa magnificent structure. The federal government has contributed some $10 million to it, and we will see it finished towards the end of this year. We have a beautiful auditorium at Munro Martin Parklands, and we also have JUTE, which is another smaller theatre. I will be attending the opening of another magnificent theatre at St Andrew's College very shortly. The combination of what we have in our region gives people choice. We have the Rondo, where people can basically sit right around the stage; they encircle the stage. It holds about 150 people. We will have magnificent works at the Cairns regional centre, when it opens. It will hold about 1,600 to 1,700 people. Then we have the Botanical Gardens, which holds about 2,000 people. So we really cover it all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, I'm determined to ensure that the Rondo Theatre doesn't fall by the wayside, and hopefully, with a little help from the federal government, it can continue to provide fantastic productions to Cairns residents and visitors for generations to come. And I look forward, possibly, at some stage, to getting you up there and inviting you to come along to enjoy some of the cultural finesse of the magnificent Far North Queensland. Thank you very much.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  It's been quite some time since I rose to address this chamberâ96 days in fact, not that I was counting, of course. It's been 96 days since I stood in this chamber and declared: I am not done. Well, after a very long and very gruelling election campaign, I am once again proudly representing the good people of my electorate, Longman, here in parliament. Like I said 96 days ago, I am not done, and I am not done because there is still so much work to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government needs to be held to account, and I'm going to continue to keep doing that. I will hold this government to account when they cut millions of dollars from our Caboolture Hospital. I will stand up against this government when they cut vital funding and resources from our schoolsâgreat schools in Longman, like Morayfield East State School and Caboolture State School. And I will always fight back against this government when they try to give billions of dollars of taxpayers' money to the big banks. I've always said that politics is about priorities. A good local member prioritises their community. They prioritise people. They prioritise people over big banks, and I will do that. I will do exactly that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The past 96 days have allowed me the opportunity to spend even more time in my wonderful community, having conversations with local people. These are conversations I love having. Longman is a wonderful community with wonderful people. These conversations, whether they are at a shopping centre or a train station, whether they're at a community meeting, on the doors or on the phones, helped me get a better understanding of the issues that are keeping people awake at night. Well, there's Andrew. He's from Caboolture. I met with him while I was out doorknocking late one Saturday afternoon. He's a nurse, and he's worried about Malcolm Turnbull's cuts to the Caboolture Hospital. $2.9 million is a lot of money. It's a lot of money, and Andrew knows firsthand the impact that these cuts will have. And then there's Simon. He's furious about this government giving $17 billion to the big banks. He's furious and rightly so. I got to know Simon quite well over the campaign, and I'm very glad I did. Then, of course, there's Jack and Grace. Jack and Grace are both completing year 12, going to a school in the area, and I chatted with them quite often about education. But it's not just students who are concerned about universities and schools; it's the parents, it's the grandparents, it's teachers and it's employers. It's the whole community that is concerned about education. I prioritise this community, our community, and I will fight against this government and their cruel priorities. And I'm going to keep that promise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately I have a great united team who is standing up for Australians with me, a great united team that will fight for affordable and accessible health care and quality schools. I'm proud to be a member of the federal Labor caucus, alongside our leader, Bill Shorten, and deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, to be standing up for Labor values, to be standing up for local people, to be standing up for working people. I'm also very proud to have been sworn in alongside three amazing Labor people, people like the member for Braddon, Justine Keay; the member for Fremantle, Josh Wilson; and, of course, Patrick Gorman, the new member for Perth. I know each of these three are just as committed as I am to making Australia a great place for everyoneâregardless of what job you do, regardless of how much money you have in the bank.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know there's a general election on the horizon, likely to start next year. I'm going to take this opportunity to again put the Prime Minister and his government on notice, because I intend to again fight for the people of Longman. I intend to fight for the people of Longman against this government and their cuts. I intend to fight for the people of Longman because together the people, with me, will fight and prioritise our community. We will prioritise people and not the banks. The member for Braddon has just mentioned that, in this by-election, not one corflute could be seen at any polling booth that mentioned how great this policy was of giving big banks a tax cutânot one corflute. And I can tell you why: it's because this is not a good idea. This in no way helps any person who lives in my electorate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IRONS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  Robert Riddell Dunn was born on 12 April 1929 and passed away on 25 June 2018. First and foremost, Rob was a husband, a father and then a grandfather with very strong family values. I was lucky and privileged to have known Rob as a boss, as a friend, as a business partner and as a mentor. Rob was someone who I admired enormously, and I would have been proud to be a part of his family, but I was part of his business family for 15 years. The values he held embodied everything the Liberal Party stood for, and it was these values that taught me the path to this place. The values he had weren't taken from the Liberal Party; they were just his values.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rob was a self-made man and a pioneer in his industry, and he not only carved success out for himself but was selfless in what he gave back. He couldn't have done it without the support of his beautiful wife, Faye, and his family. His desire to improve himself and make the necessary sacrifices to achieve his goals was a strength within him which saw him achieve many things in life. Rob was an Australian story of success, where he grew a business by hard work and enterprise after starting with nothing. Mr Speaker, there are many things I could share with you and the chamber on a personal level, like the fact we both loved the Melbourne Football Club and we both loved golfâbut I need to move on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to give you a family perspective on Rob's lifeâand what a life it was, full of fun and adventure. This is from his eulogy: 'Rob's motto seemed to be "Have fun with Dunn". A great life, and a greatly respected man.' Anyone who met him seemed to somehow be touched by him, by his charisma and by his charm. He touched the lives of many people and in many placesâin business, at Rotary, and at his beloved Commonwealth Golf Club, to name a few. When people heard of his passing, the main comments heard were that he was a wonderful, beautiful and gentle manâhe made you feel special. It is hard to put into words his special characteristics: that twinkle in his all-knowing eyes, that cheeky grin, that firm, warm handshake, and that sense of fun.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Robert Riddell Dunn was born at 10 Regent Street, Brighton, to Harold Mirams Dunn and Daisy Riddell. He went to Wilson Street primary and Brighton Tech. At an early age, he was sent on his bike to get milk and was hit by a truck, which left him with some lifelong scars. But that didn't keep him off the bike, because he had to ride daily from Brighton to Footscray Tech to do his engineering studies. At Footscray Tech he became lifelong friends with Peter Thomson, the golfer. The flag at the Commonwealth Golf Club was lowered out of respect for each of these two great men. After graduating, Rob joined the SEC, initially at Newport Power Station, and then in the Kiewa Valley as a cadet engineer. Whilst working at Kiewa, the SEC bus he was in rolled over the mountainside, resulting in Rob suffering a broken back. But the SECâor, as he referred to it, 'slow, easy and comfortable'âwas certainly not the place for rushing Robert. At around this time, he met the love of his life, Faye Osborne, at the Ormond Hall dance, and then again at the Elwood Life Saving Club. They married on 9 August 1952, a strong and beautiful marriage that lasted for the next 65 years. They travelled the world together, had two kids, six grandchildren and a thoroughly enjoyable life together. Their relationship has been a great model for the rest of their family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1953, Rob started working at Hendy Industries as sales manager doing residential and commercial heating. At this time, a new thing called air conditioning sparked his interest, and he saw a business opportunity. America was the home of air conditioning, so he wrote to several companies in the US to try and gain experience. Chrysler, the motor company, was interested, and soon Faye and Rob were over at Chrysler's air-conditioning factory in Dayton, Ohio. Rob learnt the air-conditioning business and Chrysler then sent him to Adelaide to their manufacturing plant and to distribute their Airtemp products. His daughter, Bambi, was born in Adelaide in 1958. In September 1960, he left Chrysler on good terms to set up his own company, Dunn Air Conditioning, in Moray Street, South Melbourne, distributing Chrysler products. His son, Brad, was born a few months later.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He travelled to Japan and many other places around the world picking up products, and then he opened offices in Brisbane, Sydney, Perth and Adelaide, followed by international expansion into Singapore and Hong Kong. There was no stopping him. Rob was, as I said, a self-made man. In 1985 he sold the manufacturing side, much to his regret, to the EmailAir company and then focused on his market strengths. Unfortunately, he had to sell the manufacturing as he was forced out by the unions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the short time I have left, I pass on my sympathy to the Dunn family, particularly to Faye, Brad and Bambi. Rest in peace, Rob.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="font-weight:bold;">):</span>  I am glad, grateful and humble to have been re-elected as the member for Fremantle. It is a great privilege, and it brings with it a great responsibility. The trust placed in me as a representative will continue to shape my work, it will drive me forward and it is a trust I will strive to keep earning as I go. I'm looking forward to again pouring myself into the work of this parliament, and I'm rapt to share that task with my new old colleagues in this place, the member for Mayo and especially the members for Longman and Braddon. I'll share that work with an old and dear friend, the new, new member for Perth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing about campaigning is that you have the opportunity to encounter firsthand the issues that matter to the broad and diverse Australian community. I can tell you that the people of Fremantle know we live in a time of significant challenge, and I can tell you they don't trust the approach of this government. They know instinctively that you don't address falling real wages, insecure employment and inequality by cutting penalty rates and giving away billions in tax cuts to profitable banks and multinationals. They know that cutting funds to the ABC and the Australian Public Service and running down Australian shipping are all acts of profound self-harm. They know that inaction on climate change puts Australia's future at enormous risk and prevents us from achieving our potential as a renewable energy superpower. They know that government leadership to take us out of live sheep export is not only possible but sensible and necessary, and they know a sensible, compassionate, rules based approach to humanitarian migration is entirely possible and, at the same time, that such an approach is utterly incompatible with the interminable detention and grave neglect of asylum seekers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than anything, they want government to have the capacity to create, support and maintain the things we share together, our hospitals and schools, our public transport and community infrastructure, our environment and our social safety net. Those are the foundations of our shared wellbeing. They are the foundation of our egalitarian and Australian way of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the course of the by-election, I'm happy to say that we ran the most extensive person-to-person campaign we've ever run in the division of Fremantle. We made more than 22,000 phone calls. We knocked on more than 12,000 doors. I campaigned for 79 days straight, and I enjoyed it. It was a reminder that Fremantle is an engaged community and that Australians are welcoming, thoughtful people. I enjoyed it because I was never alone. I was part of a campaigning endeavour that was not a means to an end but a great thing in itself, an expression of Labor's commitment to grassroots engagement, to participatory democracy and to collective action. Those are our values, and we live them when we listen to people and when we explain our approach to policies and programs as we ask for their support and their trust. I'm glad to have been re-elected on that basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge and thank the many people who contributed their time and energy to the Fremantle campaign, which was only possible through the efforts of hundreds of volunteers, many of them campaigning for the first time. I'm grateful to my state and federal and labour movement colleagues who gave me their practical and moral support through the winter months. I want to particularly mention the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition and also my fellow member for Fremantle, Simone McGurk. Special and enduring thanks go to my campaign manager, Matt and the fieldwork maestros, Joe, Kerry, Millie, Emily and Zoey. I love your work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, there are two groups of people who require special mentionâfirst, my staff: Kath, LeeAnne, Zita, Kerry, Nick, Joe and Peter. They shared with me the wonderful but also unrelenting work of serving the people of Fremantle until I resigned in May, and now we will share that work again. Representative work is often a team effort, and I'm very lucky to have a brilliant and big-hearted team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly of all, I want to thank my family: my wife, Georgia, and our three children, Abby, Priya and Oscar. The all-encompassing work and life of a representative is an enormous privilege. As a family we know that, yet it is all encompassing, it does require sacrifices, and those are made by all of us. I campaigned hard and without break for the last three months, but I was at home; I was able to do some of the 'dad's taxi' stuff, be the short-order breakfast cook, pitch in with my residual maths skills on the homework front, and Georgia and I got to walk the dog on the beach, but now I am here. I feel blessed to be here, and I know how fortunate I am to do this work, but still I am away, and the reason I'm away is to contribute to the work of this parliament, to represent the people of Fremantle, to fight for their interests and for a fairer Australia, which in turn requires a concerted and paramount focus on the things we share.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  Tonight in Woolbrook, where I grew up, it's going to be minus three. On Sunday it will be minus six. In Armidale it will be minus eight. I say this so that people can clearly understand why I have an absolute passion for affordable power. Without affordable power, people on the poorer side of town, on the edges, who can't afford their power bills, will be cold. They deal with it in a way that is quite simple and, when we think about it, quite disgraceful for our nation: they go to bed. They go to bed because that is the most affordable place to stay warm. As a nation we should not be idle bystanders tonight; we should be completely mindful of these people. Someone has to stand up for the dignity in these people's lives. Someone has to drive and be the iconoclast, if required, to state that the primary motivation for this parliament before anything else is to maintain the dignity of its people, the people of Australia, and that can't be maintained if we can't provide one of the basics of their standard of livingâthat is, affordable power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a good nation we should comply as best we can with international agreements by the letter and to the extent to which they were written, but in doing so we can't put aside other people. Other people cannot be the casualties of these agreements. In our upcoming consideration we must look at the NEG, our plan to comply with these agreements, through one prism alone: will this bring down power prices? Power prices cannot stay where they are. When people come to your office and you know they can't afford their $600 power bill then you have to accept that what they are telling you is the truth. Individuals are coming in with $1,500 power bills. These things are beyond the pale for people to be able to afford. If our total commitment is to zero emissions then we have put ourselves in an invidious position, because gas is one of the most expensive feedstocks in the pricing of power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a huge renewable resource in New England, but one of the biggest arguments I have now is people arguing against wind towers. Everybody wants them, but they don't want to see them. They want them out of sight. In emails tonight people were very concerned about solar farms. This is making things rather interesting: people don't want wind towers, they don't want solar farms, they are worried about nuclear energy, and pumped hydro is actually a net energy user. Ultimately you go back to an obvious position: if we had affordable power in the past, and the capacity to keep dignity in the lives of people who tonight are going to be dealing with minus three in Woolbrook and about minus six in Armidale, we have to reinvest in the basic logic we had then.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that we are a smart nation. We can do things better than we did in the past, and be more effective than we were in the past, but we can't be blind to still the major provider of power in Australia, which is coal, and also be blind to the fact that the vast majority of the increases in power that have been generated in the world has come from coal, and even more so in Asia. We should do it more effectively in a more environmentally sensitive way, but we can't just switch it off. If we decide that coal is such anathema that we can't mention it anymore, and we really want zero emissions, then we are going to head down one pathâthat is, nuclear energy. As an exporter of the product we would have to start looking at using it ourselves.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this because we are seeing a malaise. I just listened to the member for Longman's speech, and I congratulate her, but the vote for the Labor Party didn't get out of the 30s. The vote for the LNP didn't get out of the 20s. Stop thinking that there is no disconnect out there. The two major parties could not get above 70 per cent of the vote. Stop thinking that the people are not frustrated and not angry, that there is no pushback. We have to start listening to these people. If you don't start listening to them, they are going to start forgetting us. That prognosis is loud and clearâand should be before us in the next couple of days.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker Gee, for stepping into the breach. Parliamentarians often refer to July as the winter break, but up in the north it's been non-stop actionâthe dry season is here. Here are just some of the highlights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a forum looking at the great opportunities that will follow on from the start of flights from Darwin to mainland China. The member for Hunter and the member for Blaxland came up and saw firsthand some of the exciting things happening in the north. Their visit included a trip out to the Humpty Doo Barramundi farm. In fact, the member for Blaxland visited twice over the winter break, including a visit out to the increasingly neglected Kakadu National Park. I understand my good friend Dr Freelander also made his way out to Kakadu during the break, which is fantastic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the opportunity to join the Australian American Leadership Dialogue, first at Fort Worth in Texas and then in Washington DC, where I met with the office of congressman and former US marine Seth Moulton to discuss veterans affairs issues. I shared with his office the details of Labor's veterans employment policy. Speaking of veterans and defence, I joined an ADF Parliamentary Program on Operation Resolute in Darwin. I went out to sea with HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Glenelg</span>, a patrol boat. Well done to Lieutenant Commander Jorge McKee, the commanding officer of that vessel. Also, well done to the commanding officer of NORFORCE, Lieutenant Colonel Brett Thomas DSC. I also went up on a maritime surveillance patrol with Cobham staff in their border protection role. Well done to all of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I held a crime and justice task force forum with the member for Hotham, Clare O'Neilâthank you. We listened to the community and to local service providers on some of the current challenges. We had many events out in the community. The Darwin Show was fantastic. I chaired a public hearing of the Standing Committee on Industry, Innovation, Science and Resources looking at how the mining sector can better support local businesses. We also had the member for Griffith up in Darwin, where we had a youth roundtable discussing mental health for young people and university funding. It is not helpful that $30 million is being ripped out of Charles Darwin University. I also had the great fortune of joining you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on exercise Pitch Black. I want to thank Air Commodore Michael Kitcher for the way that he hosted us during that event. The Palmerston Regional Hospital is opening soon, so well done to all, and we look forward to great health services being provided to the people of my electorate from that hospital.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  I rise to acknowledge the work of community group Support Lindfield in advocating for a revitalisation of the commercial heart of Lindfield through an intelligent development of the land behind the row of shops on the western side of the Pacific Highway in Lindfield. I specifically acknowledge the tireless work of the president of Support Lindfield, Linda McDonald, the vice-president, Stephen McKenzie, and all of the committee members and those who have lent their voices to the cause. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The genesis for Support Lindfield was a proposal by the New South Wales government in 2012 to spend around $34 million to build a multistorey car park in Lindfield for rail commuters. The reaction of the local community was, 'That's good, but can't we have more?' And, through its advocacy support, Lindfield made the case that the proposal for the stand-alone carpark should be put on hold while better alternatives were explored. Since that time, Ku-ring-gai Council has made some progress towards this vision of a redeveloped Lindfield commercial heart, purchasing some land to add to its current holdings where the present ground-level car park sits. Their concept plans feature a supermarket, multistorey car parking, parkland and public open space, smaller shops and a residential apartment block. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, the giant supermarket company Woolworths, who have developed similar and successful projects in Double Bay and Lane Cove, put forward an unsolicited proposal to Ku-ring-gai Council. Woolworths argues that its unsolicited proposal would realise the vision set out by Ku-ring-gai Council in its concept plans. On 26 June the council voted, instead, to go out to market to call for proposals from any interested private sector proponent. I hope that secures a good response. Of course, Woolworths is free to resubmit its proposal through this process, and I certainly hope they do that. Council has committed that the expressions-of-interest process will close in October, and there'll be further community consultation as part of that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After more than six years of deliberation and delay on this issue, since 2012, there is a strong desire amongst the community for action. I do strongly encourage Ku-ring-gai Council to progress this matter in a timely fashion. I very much want to congratulate Support Lindfield for the work they have done in advocating for an intelligent redevelopment of the commercial heart of Lindfield. There's been a lot of time, energy and thought put into their work. I would certainly be pleased to see council deliver on its commitment that there will be a clear and certain outcome from the expression-of-interest process by the end of the year, and I look forward to an achievement of the vision of the commercial heart of Lindfield being redeveloped to the benefit of the Lindfield community. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  I rise today, on behalf of my Hotham community, to speak out against the government's cuts to Status Resolution Support Services. SRSS is designed to support people who are on bridging visas in Australia. This means they have applied for refugee status but the immigration department is still making up its mind on whether it will be given or not. SRSS provides these people, some of whom are the most vulnerable people in our entire country, the supports they need to survive. We're talking here about things like casework, trauma counselling and the necessary income they need to have a roof over their head and money to feed their children. A lot of these people have dependent children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are people who are trying to rebuild their lives in our country. Many of them have seen and experienced things that no human being should ever have to go through. They have come here at the generosity of this beautiful country of ours to seek our support and assistance, and it is my belief that the least we can do for these people is try to provide them with the support they need, to have food in the fridge and to get their kids to school every day, while their refugee status is being determined. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak today at the request of some crucial groups within my community who advocate for the interests of refugees. And they do so from rich and great experience. I'm very lucky to represent an area of Melbourne where we have a great number of refugees. You only need to walk down Springvale Road or Buckingham Avenue in Springvale to see the enormous contribution that will come when we provide support to these communities. But if we take that support away it's an act of utter cruelty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The City of Greater Dandenong has been one of the key advocates in this area, and I want to pay tribute to the mayor of the City of Greater Dandenong, Youhorn Chea, who travelled to Canberra with some of his councillor colleagues to conduct meetings. Labor's spokesperson on the issue, the member for Blair, was kind enough to speak directly with the mayor about this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that's been frustrating in watching this issue play out is that the government hasn't been able to provide really basic information about who is going to be affected by this policy change. We conducted Senate estimates recently where Labor senators subjected this to the normal inquiry process. Basic things like how many people will have their supports taken away and how many dependent children will have supports removed were not able to be answered by the department. That is just simply not good enough. Some students at Monash also raised this with meâAustin Bond, Charmain Sim, Mia Glass and Ale Kan. These are four young people who are desperately concerned about this issue, and I thank them for their advocacy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="261393" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  The Country Women's Association is part of the heart and soul of regional Australia and I'm delighted to share with this chamber that the Eugowra branch of the CWA has just celebrated its 90th anniversary. It's particularly fitting that it celebrated the occasion with a luncheon for 120 members and guests. The guests included: World President of the Associated Country Women of the World Ruth Shanks AM; State President of the CWA of New South Wales Annette Turner; the Central Western Group president, Alana Donaldson; patron of the CWA Central Western Group Gail Hayden; the Cabonne mayor, Kevin Beatty; and Councillor Cheryl Newsom. Other guests travelled from Queensland, Sydney, Wagga, Canberra and Broken Hill. When special organisations like the CWA in Eugowra pass these milestones, it is very important that we recognise not only the occasion itself but the purpose and the role that these organisations play in our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CWA was inspired by women's institutes in Britain and Canada. Its brief was to improve conditions for women on the land. It was formed in 1922. Just a few years later, in May 1928, the Canowindra branch of the CWA sponsored a public meeting to form the Eugowra CWA. Thirty women attended, including Mrs Pengilly, Mrs Alford, Mrs Noble, Mrs Welsh and Mrs Douglas, and the descendants of those women still live in Eugowra today. The 90th anniversary was thus a fitting celebration for the state president of the New South Wales CWA, Annette Turner, to present a 50-year service badge to Janet Noble. Janet's a relative of founding member Nan Alford nee Noble. She was followed by Isobel Noble, a life member, and then Janet herself and now Janet's daughter-in-law Libby Noble. Libby's two daughters, Sophie and Laura, are junior members. So there is a continuing family connection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other highlights of the afternoon included the Cavalcade of History and Fashion from Sydney, showing women's fashions from 1919 to 1939, including dresses and hats. Founding Eugowra member Mrs Mabel Pengilly was the grandmother of present branch member and patron Shirley Heinzel, who cut the beautifully decorated cake made by Annette Connell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the current members of the Eugowra CWA, including: President Margaret Swift; Treasurer Frances Anderson; the secretary and publicity officer, Janet Noble; the international officer, Dorothy Jones; and also members Jennifer Jones, Lorraine Carty, Ula Langfield, Eve Hayes, Joan McMillan, Jeanette Norris, Rosemary Taylor, Libby Noble, Beverley Pengilly, Yvonne Smalley, Sharon Radwick and Ruth Neilsen. I'd also like to mention patron and member Shirley Heinzel and junior members Laura Noble and Sophie Noble.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the Eugowra CWA is a busy and vibrant branch involved with local group, state and even national affairs. We could not do without the CWA in our country communities, and I wish the Eugowra CWA branch a very happy 90th anniversary.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  'Tonight I rise to speak about the Coopers Plains level crossing in my electorate. This is a very dangerous level crossing and an overpass should have been built there some 25 years ago. Lack of an overpass contributes to the problems which cause one of Brisbane's most congested intersections, the intersection of Boundary, Orange Grove and Beenleigh Roads at Coopers Plains. Lack of an overpass has caused small business to decline in the general Coopers Plains area and it has also, unfortunately, caused several fatalities.' Those are not my words; they are the words of my predecessor, the former Liberal member for Moreton, the Hon. Gary Hardgrave, back in 1996. Twenty-two years later, people on the south side are still risking their lives daily at this dangerous crossing, but there are more of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The RACQ spokeswoman, Lucinda Ross, just last month said it was worrying that there had been more than 30 boom gate strikes over the past seven years at the crossing. I've been calling for a solution to this dangerous crossing for years. I wrote to the Prime Minister earlier this year, before he brought down the 2018 budget, asking him to commit federal funding to fix the Coopers Plains crossing. Sadly, no money was provided in the Liberal's 2018 budge. But the Prime Minister did respond on 24 May and said he had referred my letter to the Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities, who would provide a detailed response. Eighty days later, I am still waiting for the minister's response. Jules Verne went around the world in that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wrote to the Brisbane City Council Lord Mayor, Graham Quirk, asking him to reconsider his 2018 budget. The Brisbane City Council has previously funded 50 per cent of two crossing upgrades on the north side of the riverâone in Geebung and one in Bracken Ridge. However, the Liberal lord mayor, in his response, is only prepared to fund 15 per cent for the upgrade at Coopers Plains on the south side of the river. There is one rule north of the river and one rule south. I've received a response from the lord mayor. He admits he has made much more generous funding arrangements on the north side of Brisbane than he is willing to contribute to the dangerous south-side crossing, but he refuses to budge from this miserly 15 per cent. Why is Lord Mayor Graham Quirk treating south-side residents as second-class citizens? The locals are sick of political buck-passing. I think it's fair that the cost to upgrade this dangerous crossing be shared equally between the three levels of governmentâa third each for federal, state and local. How's that for a solution?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Palaszczuk Labor government in Queensland has already shown strong commitment in its recent budget, with funding for the first full business case. But a miserly 15 per cent from Graham Quirk, when I'm only asking for 33 per cent, is a slap in the face for south-siders. Labor, at both a federal and state level, is prepared to get this mess sorted. If Lord Mayor Graham Quirk would stop playing politics and pay this fair share, we'd be much closer to having shovels in the ground and that would make it safer. It is time that we got this mess sorted. Schoolkids, trucks, cars and commuters all want it sorted. It's time for the lord mayor to step up.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  Earlier this month, I visited Sacred Heart College in Sorrento to present a number of students with certificates of commendation for their voluntary work in social justice. I joined Principal Peter Bothe, Social Justice Coordinator Rossana Hywood, members of staff, students and parents in the school auditorium to acknowledge them for their outstanding efforts in a range of community projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sacred Heart College has a distinguished record of providing a balanced, holistic education to students by encouraging academic learning and sporting achievement, as well as nurturing cultural, social and spiritual values. I was pleased to learn of the students' participation in the Young Vinnie's program and their many activities, including a visit to the Mercyville aged-care facility to spend time with the aged and serve morning tea. This year, the year 10 students took part in the Vinnie's winter sleepout. Ninety five students took part, raising $4,360. Students have also been involved in distributing handmade quilts to the needy. The Cancer Council biggest morning tea raised $716, and a further raffle by the staff raised $722. I learned of the year 11s' mission trip in which they raised funds and travelled to an orphanage in Vietnam, where they assisted with projects.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I would like to acknowledge the individual efforts of two very outstanding students. Thirteen year-old Vincent Pettinicchio has been involved in preparing care packs for the homeless since the age of eight. As part of this year's project, 72 parents, 56 students and 10 staff members volunteered after school hours to pack more than 1,540 care packs. The Rotary club of Hillarys also assisted with this project. Scott Guerini, aged 12, has been involved in raising money for Telethon through his walking. He walked 25 kilometres, at the age of four, to raise money for Telethon. He has continued to walk marathon-size distances to raise fund for the Telethon program, and had raised $100,000 by the age of 10. In 2016 Scott wrote an illustrated book of his journey entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Did You Know You Can Change The World</span>? Since 2010 Scott has walked over 450 kilometres and raised $141,000 for Telethon. I commend the staff, students and parents of Sacred Heart College for their commitment to the social justice programs. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  Last week was Early Learning Matters Week. I had the pleasure of visiting Goodstart in Wentworthville. I thank the centre director, Rebecca, for that opportunity. It was great to hear directly from early educators about the important role they play in educating our youngest minds, and I saw firsthand quality early learning in actionâgreat educators bonding with young children, supporting their key development needs and helping to set them up for success in school and in life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Early Learning Matters Week highlights how the first five years of life are critical to children's social, emotional and cognitive development. Most shamefully, the Turnbull government's recent changes to child care, while they have left some families better off, have stopped or reduced support to 279,000 families around Australia. It is funding that families rely on to help balance the household budget when they return to work. In Parramatta alone there are 2,698 families who are worse off because of changes to child care. That is 24 per cent, or one in four, of families who are worse off. This is really worrying as most of the families who are worse off are families in the lowest income cohortâthat is, families who have a family income of less than $65,710âand the less money you earn the more worse off you are. The changes exacerbate the difficult problem that parents find when they try to return to work in that they can't get sufficient child care unless they're working sufficient hours and they can't work sufficient hours unless they have child care already lined up. So that catch 22 is already seeing families kept out of the workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of the Liberals' childcare debacle, 350,000 children across Australia are about to miss out on preschool because of another changeâanother cutâof $440 million from the national preschool program when the current funding expires in June 2020. Tanya Plibersek has said that since the first preschool agreement was signed by Labor in 2008 preschool enrolments have increased from 77 per cent to almost 93 per cent. That is incredibly important. All of the research shows that children who attend two days of good-quality early learning have a far better outcome, even at university level, some 20 years later, than those who don't, and the more disadvantaged the child the greater the difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side are committed to child care. Our record proves it. We reduced the financial burden of child care on families with increases to the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We increased the childcare subsidy to $7,500 and invested $970 million to create universal access to preschool for four-year-olds in partnerships with the state and territories. They are incredibly important changes for the adults of the future, who are currently at preschool age, and I urge the government to really think seriously about the damage they're doing to children.</span>

The Harris Cycle Co. was opened in 1918, owned by Harold Wotherspoon and Cecil Harris. The shop is still located in the original spot at 85 Keen Street. Darryl Pursey has worked in the shop for 33 years, with 27 of those years as the owner. He bought the business from his father-in-law and son of one of the founders, Si Wotherspoon. Darryl has put the longevity of the business down to old-fashioned service and making sure he and his staff look after their customers, many of whom are second- and third-generation customers. Darryl's mechanic Darren Spears does a fantastic job in both sales and repairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Darryl has competed in both road and mountain bike competitions in the past, but most of his time now is spent developing mountain bike trails so that families can ride in safer conditions compared with being on the road. He also mentors many young riders and supports the juniors in many ways. His volunteer work with the Northern Rivers Dirty Wheels Mountain Bike Club has seen the construction of trails in New Italy. He is currently working with Sheryn De-Rae and David Hegerty on the new Duck Creek trail. David has said that, without the countless hours of volunteering from Darryl, the trails and sport would not be where they are today. I congratulate Darryl. Besides being an incredibly nice person, this is a wonderful achievement over 100 years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Helen Trustum is a living legend in our region and, when you look at the achievements of her life, you can understand why. Helen grew up in the Coraki area. After marrying Allan, and with sons Richie and Rodney, the family moved to Bentley and established the Bentley Downs Charolais stud. In 1980, Helen picked up a pen and has been writing the history of the Northern Rivers ever since. Her first book was a history of the Trustum family, and it was then followed by othersâ<span style="font-style:italic;">In and Around Bentley</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">My Mother's</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Memories </span>and <span style="font-style:italic;">Old Time Country </span><span style="font-style:italic;">H</span><span style="font-style:italic;">alls</span>, just to name a few. In total, she has written 10 books on the history of the area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Helen's other achievements include the 1985 Australia Day Citizen of the Year and the 1986 Advance Australia Helpful Citizen Award for the Casino Hospital centenary. In 1998, she became the first woman in Australia to be awarded life member of the Charolais Society. She's also a life member of the Casino Show Society and a full member of the Richmond River Historical Society. For many years, she has also been the coordinator of the Bentley Art Prize, which gives local and young artists a place to showcase their work. Thank you, Helen. And, yes, you are a living legend.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  I rise here today to stand against the Turnbull government and its complete and utter disrespect for our public sector. As a nation, we should want the best and brightest working in our government departments. We should be proud to have industry and sector experts working in our government departments, experts who will provide world-leading research and services ensuring that, as a nation, we are innovative and progressive on the issues that are affecting the people who live in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should not be selling these assets off to the Turnbull government's private sector labour hire mates. It is an absolute disgrace that labour hire has flourished under the LNP government. They should hang their heads in shame. The fact that the government is proud to outsource jobs and services, proud to privatise and proud to cut jobs in regional Queensland is completely unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Townsville, the LNP government has cut 149 jobs from the ATO. And the relocation of the Royal Australian Air Force's No. 38 Squadron King Air Fleet from Townsville to East Sale, Victoria, resulted in the loss of 40 aviation jobs. There are 50 fewer Defence staff in June 2017 than there were in December 2012. Nineteen jobs went from our very important CSIRO. Ten jobs were cut from Defence APS support staff in Townsville. A cut of 50 per cent resulted in the loss of 30 regional Customs jobs in Queenslandâfrom Gladstone to Thursday Island, including Townsville. And five jobs were lost at the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. This is an absolute disgrace, and the government should hang its head in shame.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government seems hellbent on destroying our public sector. Clearly only a Labor government will support our public sector, because a Shorten Labor government will abolish the coalition's arbitrary Average Staffing Level cap, strengthening the capacity and capability of the Australian Public Service. The ASL cap has become counterproductive and has led to a hollowing out of the public service, sparking a blowout in spending on contractors and consultants. By abolishing the cap, agencies will be allowed to set their staffing levels based on operational requirements. The Prime Minister's own department has described the ASL cap as 'a blunt instrument' and said, 'Through removing ASL caps, agencies may have greater flexibility to recruit specialist staff at a reduced cost.' By imposing an arbitrary cap, the Turnbull government is not only forcing government agencies to spend more taxpayer dollars on less services; they are reducing the number of quality, secure jobs in my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians with a disability will be particularly welcoming of this announcement as the ASL cap has led to long service delays in the National Disability Insurance Scheme, with some people in regional areas waiting months for access. It is absolutely paramount that we have a strong public sector. It is essential for the growth of this nation into the future.</span>

It's a place where the local service station also acts as a general store and a post office, and where families have farmed the same land for generations. But while the regional communities of Canning are proud of their rural identity and character, the fact is that they often struggle due to the lack of essential services and financial investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition saw that problem and acted. Through the Building Better Regions Fund, the coalition is committing $641 million to build infrastructure and foster jobs in regional communities. Under round 1 of the BBRF, Canning was the recipient of almost $3 million. This money has gone towards two vital projects: the Dwellingup Trails Centre will be the focal point of the Shire of Murray's new adventure trails through the forested centre of the Peel region, and the expansion of the Quambie Park in the town of Waroona will increase its capacity to provide assisted-living aged care for the local district.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it doesn't stop there. Over the winter break, I have announced three new projects under round 2 of the BBRF. More than $3.5 million has been granted to Bedingfield Park, a community owned and not-for-profit nursing home in Pinjarra. With this funding, Bedingfield will finally be able to realise its long-term goal of building a 25-bed, high-care accommodation wing focusing on dementia care. As the only aged-care facility in the Shire of Murray, this is a much needed investment. It will also boost the local economy, creating 18 jobs during construction and another 18 upon completion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In North Dandalup, $2.5 million will be invested to help build an agri research centre. Led by CY O'Connor, this project will provide cutting-edge research in farming and agriculture for the region. Two hundred thousand dollars has also been granted to the Waroona Men's Shed. A local institution, the Waroona Men's Shed has outgrown its current location. This funding will provide for the construction of a new shed, purpose built to enable the men to continue their craftsmanship for local schools and community groups. Finally, $95,000 has been granted to the Preston Beach Community Centre. The community centre is the hub of the town, serving as a meeting place, arts centre, medical facility and emergency service hub.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional towns like Dwellingup, Waroona, Pinjarra and Preston Beach are the heart of Australia and deserve our support. I look forward to the opening of round 3 of the BBRF and this government's continued support of regional Australia. Thank you.</span>

That applies to residents and businesses, and also to gas and electricity. Of course, the two are connected. Many people may not be fully aware of the extent to which rising electricity prices are actually driven by rising gas prices, given the important role of gas in the production of electricity.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has seen its worst-ever gas crisis in the last few years under the Turnbull government, with devastating pain for residential consumers, pensioners trying to heat their houses and families trying to make ends meet. The government will tell us, no doubt, through this debate and elsewhere through the week, that it's all somehow Labor's fault but 'Don't worry, it's all getting better.' I will quote at the outset Garbis Simonian, the managing director of New South Wales gas user and wholesaler Western Energy Services Corp., on 25 July in response to the latest interim report from the ACCC as part of their gas inquiry. With regard to the prospects of gas prices rising beyond $10 a gigajoule, he said, 'Get ready for mass job losses.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a personal view, I will state at the outset, shared by many in the community that one of the greatest policy failures in recent years in this country is the failure of Australian governmentsâand I say that in pluralâto set a sustainable energy policy and stick with it. And I might say that that is alongside housingâthat is a debate for another time. By 'sustainable', I don't just mean environmentally sustainable but a set of long-term rules for the market. We have been trying to settle this with the Liberal Party for over 10 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The No. 1 reason for rising energy prices is policy uncertainty, and that is a government failure. We had the government elected on the promise to get rid of the carbon price and somehow that was going to fix everything. That was a lie, and Australians are onto that. Have prices gone down? Does anyone actually think that has caused prices to go down? No. You love to blame Labor but also you are hoping that people forget that you have been the government for nearly five years. You're a rabble.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've returned to Canberra, after the six-week break, for a debate about the National Energy Guarantee, and we see the government is again a circus. We've got the former Prime Minister and the former Deputy Prime Minister out there, on TV all weekend and today, threatening to cross the floor and bring down the government's energy policy. We've got the member for Hughes over there who, no doubt, will rant at us soon. He does have a special talent: I do admire him for his ability to bring any speech on any topic back to why we should burn more coal in this country. It is a special talent that many of us have to sit through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we're up to policy No. 4 or No. 5. It's almost one per year. We heard about the trilemma last year: reliability, affordability and sustainability. Fair enough. We agree. We should be able to walk and chew gumâto do those three things at once. But the government has just given up. They're just trying now to get somethingâanythingâthrough their party room. The Prime Minister, it's now clear, believes in nothing. For the last few weeks he was energy agnostic. Now, desperate to hold the rebels in line, we've had extraordinary talk this morning that the government will underwrite a coal-fired power station with taxpayer dollars, one that industry doesn't want and people in the community don't want but the blockheads over on the right of the Liberal Party want. The Prime Minister is surrendering, waving the white flag and caving in to the climate denialists.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an undeniable fact that renewable energy is the cheapest form of new power. The children at Silverton Primary School in my electorate know this, as they explained it to me when I went to visit them. The environment minister is absolutely perfect for this job. I went to uni with him. He's a lovely bloke. And he doesn't believe in anything. So he's got the best crack, I agree, at getting something through your party room.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've entered the peculiar situation, the ridiculous situationâin policy terms I think we'd summarise it as WTFâwhere Australia is now the world's biggest exporter of gas but doesn't have enough for domestic use. The Prime Minister could have dealt with this last year. He had the option until November 2017 to pull the export trigger and put in place gas controls and stop this nonsense, where we're selling all the gas to the rest of the world and we don't have enough for Australian business. The impacts on consumers are profound, but we've seen, for business and manufacturers, tripling and quadrupling prices flowing through to electricity and jobs being lost. Once lost, manufacturing jobs will not come back to this country. It affects hundreds, potentially thousands, of workers in my electorate and it is no accident. It was a personal failure of the Prime Minister to act last year when he had the opportunity. Now he's hostage to his little handshake deal with big business in the corner: 'Please, please, we'll shake hands; we'll be nice to each other. Please don't raise prices.' That's not good enough.</span>

He seems also to have discovered that the best way to reduce prices is to increase supply. But the disconnect I see here is that the member for Bruce is a Victorian, a member of the Victorian Labor Party, and he has good friends, I presume, in the state Labor government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The state Labor government has banned not just fracking but also exploration and drilling for gas throughout the entire state of Victoria. Goodness me. He wants extra supply yet his friends in the state parliament have shut down any new gas in Victoria. It is a preposterous argument. I think it's at point (c) where he actually mentions electricity, and he devoted a fair bit of his time to it, I might add. He said, 'Prices have risen by up to 200 per cent.' He again neglects to mention his friends in the state government, who have tripled the excise on coal, and now he complains about electricity prices impacting on manufacturing businesses. I know he's an intelligent manâI spent some time with him through the winter break, on a delegationâand I think he knows far better. I think he actually does know far better than this. It's just this sort of posturing that we get when we come to Canberra. I said this morning, at a doorstop interview, that we need people to leave parochialism at the door, to leave politics at the door and to actually make decisions for this nation's future. If he is absolutely serious about trying to reduce electricity prices in Australia, he will of course be backing the coalition as we put forward the NEG. So thank you very much, Member for Bruce.</span>

                  </a>  He throws away a glib comment, but this is a serious issue that he is playing politics with, and the Victorian state government are at the centre of those politics, while they make decisions that impact greatly on their manufacturing industries and then try to pass the blame to someone else, when in fact it is their primary decision that is impacting in the greatest way at the coalface, let me say.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can mention the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism and the fact that the government hasn't actually enacted that mechanism. That is quite simply because the Prime Minister sat down with the gas suppliers, and gas was increased. It has been increased greatly. That has brought the spot price of gas from around $13 or $14 down to below $9. That's an enormous decrease. Spot prices, I know, are not long-term contract prices, but they are an indicator of where the market is. Australia is not going to go back to the days of gas prices of $3 or $4, because on mainland Australia our conventional gas supplies are dwindling. But we have enormous potential in tight gas supplies. But, as long as we have statesâeven including my ownâthat are locking up significant areas and banning the exploration for and extraction of tight gas, we will have prices that are above the international standard, and we absolutely should not allow that. But tight gas does not come out of the ground at $3 or $4. It is a $7 or $8 product. We have to get used to that. That has to be factored into the new energy mix.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is taking into consideration the facts and leaving the politics at the door. They are the facts of the situation. Tight gas will cost $7 or $8. You're not going to run it down cheaper than that. People will not drill for it. And they certainly will not drill in those areas of Australia where they are banned from drilling and banned from fracking. We are allowing political loonies to deny the science. I get told on many occasions to listen to the science, but the same people who tell me to listen to the science on one subject do not want to listen to the science on another subjectâin this particular case, the science on the fracking of gas. The science is sound. The technique is sound. It's used all over the world. It's been used in the Cooper Basin, in my state, for 40 years. We should get on with the job.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  I remind the member for Grey that this is Science Week. The member for Bruce has a science degree, and I'm sure that he has brought a scientific contribution to this debate. It's interesting how members of the government never seem to take responsibility for anything when they are in government, particularly with respect to responsibilities that fall fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the federal government, yet when they were in opposition they blamed the federal government of the time for all the woes of this country. In particular, I can well recall how we were told, at the 2013 election, that the carbon tax was responsible for all the high energy prices that people were paying around the country and that, if elected, the coalition would abolish the carbon tax, and energy prices would fall. Well, the carbon tax has been abolished, but energy prices continue to riseâa $630 increase or thereabouts in household energy bills in the past year alone. Quite frankly, they are likely to continue to rise unless this government gets on top of and puts forward a rational energy policy. For industry, those costs have been even greater. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have, after five years of this governmentâI remind members it is five yearsâis uncertainty in our energy supply, no credible energy policy, no credible climate change policy and no credible gas supply policy for this country. In fact, as we come into this week of sitting, energy, under the government's National Energy Guarantee proposal, will be the critical subject of debate in the coming few days, yet we know, when we look carefully at that policy, that it is nothing but another bit of government spin. The only guarantee that I can see is in the name, 'National Energy Guarantee', because the claims of guaranteed lower prices, emissions reductions and new energy investments simply don't stack up. Where is the guarantee for those claims? Indeed, if it is there, why is the government not prepared to release the modelling that they have pinned their hopes on?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people that are being asked to invest tens of millions of dollars into the future energy supplies of this country can see through the spin, and they will not be conned by it. Therefore, if the government does not put forward a rational policy, it simply won't work. We also know that if the government were to adopt a 45 per cent emissions target by 2030 then, according to modelling by RepuTex, energy prices would be another 25 per cent lower.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Respected commentator Alan Kohler said, of the National Energy Guarantee:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ the NEG is a stupendously complicated idea that isn't really designed to achieve anything at allâexcept political agreement. The emissions reduction part of the policy is so complex that nobody at all can figure out whether it will work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that sums it up beautifully. The fact that the government were trying to get an agreement out of it when they couldn't even get agreement within their own party about this policy tells its own story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gas is important to this country. As the member for Bruce quite rightly points out, we are the world's leading gas exporter, or close to itâwe certainly will be shortly, if we're not todayâyet we do not have enough gas supply for our own industries and our own community. We do not even have it at a competitive world price.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need, going into the future, is not only reliable supplies but also reliable supplies at affordable prices. The government's track record on that has been absolutely woeful. In the first instance, they blamed the states for all the problems, as we heard from the member for Grey. The reality is that, when we are the world's largest exporter of gas, fracking should not be part of the concern at all. Whether that happens or not is not the critical issue here. The critical issue is that we have gas, but it is not being made available for our energy supplies at a competitive price.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our industries know that, if prices go beyond $10 per gigajoule, they cannot compete with the rest of the world. Currently, the prices range anywhere from about $11 to $14 per gigajoule, when the ACCC says they should be down to $8. That's what we need to be trying to achieve, because that will mean that our industries remain very competitive.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:28</span>):  I was very pleased to hear some of the commentary from the other side, especially from the member for Bruce, because I think he put his foot in it when he said that he is listening to preschoolers. Preschoolers are telling the Labor Party what to do in their energy policy. The Labor Party of this nation wants to copy the failed experiment of South Australia. Even preschoolers should realise what an absolute nonsense that is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We often have debates about policy in this House where one side suggests something and we theorise about what might happen. We argue about itâabout the prospects and the unintended consequences. It's a debate about future policyâabout what will actually happen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But with Labor's policy of a 50 per cent renewable energy target, we know exactly what happens. We've run that experiment. It's called South Australia! We know what happened. It gave that state not only the highest electricity prices in the nation but the highest electricity prices in the world! Yet the Labor Party members walk in here, one after the other, and say, 'We want a 50 per cent renewable energy target, just like South Australia, because that will get prices down.' Pre-schoolers couldn't make that stuff up! Yet this is the policy that we are confronted with, recommended by those on the other side of the chamber. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the time I've been here, I think you can put most members of the Labor Party into two categories: bald-faced hypocrisy or, especially during the last two terms of parliament, 'Why haven't you fixed up our mess quick enough?' Yet this motion, amazingly, covers both of those. A member of the Labor Party who comes from Victoria walked into this chamber and tabled a motion on the growing gas crisis in Australiaâwhen the green left Labor Party down in the state that he comes from has a total ban on the exploration and development of both conventional gas and unconventional gas! When the Labor Party has that ban, and when we've got the ACCC and even the chief scientist of this nation recommending that that ban be lifted and each exploration be looked at on its merits, we have members of the Labor Party coming in here raising a motion about a gas crisis! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this whole problem goes back to the fact that, when the Gillard government gave those exploration permits, they simply didn't put in a reservation for gas. That is the root cause of this problem. I'll acknowledge that our side didn't argue that very well at the time, and we should have. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard nonsense comments during this debate, about how the more intermittent renewable energy you put into the grid the cheaper the prices will go. But that is contrary to all the evidence. If we look at the evidence from overseas, there is a clear correlation: the more intermittent generation that is put into a grid, the more intermittent solar and wind that is in a grid, the higher the electricity prices are. The correlation is almost perfect. It's the same here with South Australia. When we hear mindless comments such as 'renewables are cheaper than coal', this is a disservice to our parliament. You are not comparing like for like if you are comparing intermittent generation with base-load dispatchable generation. Any plan to increase the amount of intermittent generation into our grid and displace our current coal generation, which is currently producing electricity at a cost of around $30 to $35 a megawatt hour, can only do one thing: drive electricity prices higher in this nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure that all members have had contact from constituents complaining about electricity prices. I hope those from the Labor Party put their ideological biases aside, forget about green virtue signalling and trying to capture the green vote, and get on board with the coalition policy to get electricity prices down. The only way we can get electricity prices down is to get new base-load generation underway. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:33</span>):  Western Australia is sometimes painted by those over east as behind the rest of the country. But one of the many things Western Australia can pride itself onâand something we are doing significantly better than the rest of the countryâis gas. And that is not just producing gas, but keeping a fair share for Western Australia. WA has had a solution to this country's gas crisis for more than a decade. Under WA's domestic gas reservation policy, new gas developments must supply the equivalent of up to 15 per cent of their LNG export gas production to the WA market. While the price is open to the market, the effect is to maintain gas prices in WA below export parity. Meanwhile, the Turnbull government have been pushing the country's looming gas crisis under the rug for years. They have failed to adequately address this crisis and they have failed to ensure that there are sufficient, affordable gas supplies for the eastern states now and into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission commenced an inquiry into Australia's wholesale gas supply industry. The inquiry has highlighted the high prices being paid by Australian industry. The inquiry heard that, at best, short-term gas prices may have eased slightly from last year, recategorising them fromâwait for it!â'outrageous' to 'just unsustainable' for large manufacturers. This is a win for the Turnbull government, apparently! I'm surprised they aren't running TV ads trumpeting such a tremendous achievement. These cost increases are seriously impacting on the ability of manufacturers to continue their operations. Prices currently sit anywhere between $8 and $11 a gigajoule. This is up to three times higher than the historical price. Many manufacturers that use gas, including chemical and fertiliser makers, for whom up to 50 per cent of their total costs are attributed to gas, find these prices unsustainable. The ACCC acknowledges that, even for companies whose gas is five per cent of their costs, the price increases we are now seeing could be the difference between profit and loss. We are hearing from many Australian manufacturers that finding gas contracts to keep themselves up and running is becoming nigh on impossible because more lucrative export contracts have already been locked in. This gas crisis is hurting Australian households and threatening manufacturing jobs all over the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't just stop there. The flow-on effects of power prices from these increased gas prices even impact Western Australian workers. High energy consumers like aluminium smelters from across the east coast source their alumina from WA refiners, using bauxite mined in Western Australia. When eastern state smelters are affected by Mr Turnbull's reckless policies on energy, the jobs of WA workers are at risk too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The price reduction and export restrictions that Australian manufacturers are crying out for will not come into play unless we see some real national leadership on this issue from government. The House must condemn the Prime Minister for failing to pull the export control trigger to ensure that Aussies are not being charged exorbitant prices for their gas. Australia is the second-largest exporter of gas to the world. In fact, soon it will be the largest exporter. We should have the cheapest and most accessible gas available for our industry and homes. The gas market, though, is the least transparent resource market in Australia, suffering high transport costs, higher regions of concentration and low levels of competition as a result. Why are Australians being punished for living in this great country of plentiful resources? Responsibility for every job in the manufacturing industry now falls on the shoulders of the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment and Energyânot only the jobs in the eastern states but the flow-on effects to Western Australian workers as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government must act decisively now and find a solution to this gas crisis which is threatening countless jobs across the nation. Labor recognise the need for action with strong and effective policies to address the affordability and supply of gas to Australian businesses and households. It is why we are committed to a gas national interest reserve policy for the expansion of Australia's gas export industry. It is why we need a government that will pull the trigger on maintaining sustainable domestic gas supplies at a sustainable price. Australian gas users should have the first call on affordable gas before it is shipped offshore. We need a gas market that operates fairly and transparently in the national interest, where our gas industry retains incentives for new investments that benefit the national interest. Only under a Shorten Labor government will an affordable gas policy be secured to support Australian families with cost-of-living pressures and support Australian manufacturing jobs.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  I'm glad to talk about the importance of how this government is working to deliver lower gas and energy prices for the Australian population, but I do so with a degree of disappointment that this opportunity has come in the form of a shambolic, hysterical, inaccurate motion put forward by the opposition, rather than not only focusing on what good work is being done and how this government is treating the issue of affordable gas as a priority but also making sure that we in this parliament reflect and understand the concerns of the people we are elected to serve and represent by giving voice to their concerns on the issues that affect them in an honest and transparent way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the basis on which I will be engaging in this discussion, because, when it comes down to it, the opposition is no friend of cheaper gas prices for Australian households and industrial consumers. There is this curious attempt to whip up outrage about action taken by this government without any understanding or appreciation of the facts. Their shouting here in Canberra, like the member for Burke before me, is, frankly, embarrassingly shallow when we actually understand what is going on, particularly for Goldstein residents in the great state of Victoria, with who is selling them out in making sure that we have cheaper gas in Victoria in households and for the industrial consumers who provide the jobs that are needed to support Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the chief architect of gas shortages in Victoria is none other than the state government. We've had a constant attempt to engineer and manufacture outrageous gas prices because of ridiculous limitations and bans on actually extracting the gas that we have. The Andrews government has systemically vilified the LNG industry, with a moratorium on the exploration and development of onshore conventional gas until the end of June 2020. And it has a legislated ban on hydraulic fracturing and any other form of unconventional gas in the state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For years now the coalition has stood up and called on the Victorian government to lift impediments on the development of the gas industry and to allow for exploration and development to put more gas into the market while also making sure that we're delivering more gas at a cheaper price and, critically, with proper environmental inspection and management to make sure that consumers know they're getting a product which will aid their state but won't be a negative on the environmentâour precious environment. For years we have stood against the Andrews government in the interests of the families who fear their next bill in the letterbox and the manufacturers who are crumbling under the weight of growing electricity prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see it all the time in the Goldstein electorate. We don't have much industry in the Goldstein electorate, but we do have industrious people. All across Moorabbin, Braeside and Dandenong there are so many businesses that rely on gas to be able to deliver the jobs to the people in our south-eastern community. They are telling me directly just how hard it is for them with rising gas prices and the complete indifference of the state government to their issues and their plight, and how it is undermining jobs growth in our community. It's time those on the other side of this chamber stood up and called out the Andrews government and its reckless behaviour in making sure that those businesses can't compete. When they can't afford the cost of those basic inputs, like gas, into their production, what happens is the prices go up, jobs and their competitiveness in the international market place go down and, ultimately, it suffocates jobs growth. There are so many car parts and so many diecast industries that operate across the south-east corridor of Melbourne and Victoria who are being sold out by this government because there is no understanding of the challenges they face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Turnbull government gets it. That's why we put in place measures to make sure there is an increase in domestic gas supply. We actually know that, for all the gas we export to the world, we have to make sure we meet domestic demand first. We need to make sure that gas is not just accessible but that also affordable. We need to make sure that the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism delivers that outcome. But at least our focus is on what we need to do, rather than to obstruct and increase prices for households. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">xpired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can truly say that no federal government has ever made mental health such a central priority as this one, and that no Minister for Health has ever pursued it with such passion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government's long-term national health plan set mental health as one of its foundational four pillars, and it has backed that focus with a record $4.3 billion investment this year alone. Our last two budgets included an additional $508.1 million for mental health support, treatment and research initiatives. The minister has made large-scale commitments like $125 million for the Million Minds Mission in mental health research and $110 million in additional child and youth mental health services focused on a school setting. It has also sought to innovate with projects like our rural telehealth initiative, and $11.1 million for pragmatic suicide deterrents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know, as you do, Madam Deputy Speaker, that many people receiving psychosocial services not covered by the NDIS have been concerned about their continuity of support. The minister acted last year with an additional $109.8 million to support community mental health programs that aren't eligible. He has worked collaboratively and decisively to further broaden the community's support by agreeing to a $160 million funding package with state and territory governments for specialised psychosocial services, like rehabilitation, vocational and social skills training, and drug and alcohol addiction support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the Turnbull government's substantial support, my own community of Fisher is becoming a genuine leader in Australia in the treatment of mental health conditions. We began in 2017 when, following sustained advocacy from me, Sir Angus Houston and the University of the Sunshine Coast, the Minister for Health provided $5 million for three new mental health treatment and research projects at the Sunshine Coast Mind and NeuroscienceâThompson Institute. These three programs, examining youth mental health, suicide prevention and dementia, will produce cutting-edge research outcomes that will place the Sunshine Coast at the forefront of mental health not only in Australia but also worldwide. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In June, the minister visited Lake Kawana General Practice with me, not far from my electorate office, to announce a $3.2 million investment in an Australian first: a pilot program to investigate new approaches to treating eating disorders in our nation. Following training from the Butterfly Foundation in the latest methods for diagnosing and treating eating disorders, local healthcare professionals will refer patients to the pilot, where they will receive the sustained and comprehensive treatment they need, including up to 50 psychosocial sessions for people with anorexia nervosa or other complex disorders. A comprehensive evaluation will be undertaken at the end of the pilot that will inform treatment for patients all over Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the winter recess, I was proud to announce a further grant of $1Â½ million from this government to a joint venture between local charity endED and the Butterfly Foundation. With this funding, together they will build in my electorate the first ever residential treatment facility for eating disorders in Australia. It seems incomprehensible that in 2018 I am saying this will be the first facility in Australia. As I know well, people suffering from an eating disorder who need residential care currently have to go to secure psychiatric units. These units are clinical, unfamiliar and very often, sadly, stressful places and don't provide the ideal environment for recovery. EndED Butterfly House will specialise in the treatment of eating disorders only and will provide a peaceful and home like environment on a wonderful property set in the heart of the picturesque Mooloolah Valley. It will lead the way in how these devastating conditions are treated in our country, providing 24/7 care and support, recreation, family therapy and group therapy. It's my hope that EndED Butterfly House will be the first of others throughout the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">EndED founder Mark Forbes has been working incredibly hard on his vision for this facility for many years. He's received wonderful support from the community, including $1.3 million in philanthropic support. He is a legend. This is a great project. And this government supports it 100 per cent.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49</span>):  I am very pleased to support the motion on mental health from the member for Fisher, who, like me, comes to this place with a lived experience of mental illness in his family. Last week I was joined at Hobartville Public School, in the Hawkesbury, by the shadow minister for schools. Straightaway their principal, who is doing an outstanding job of building cohesion and inclusivity in her community, brought up mental health as the school's biggest challenge. It isn't unusual for mental wellness, and the challenges that come with that, to be the first thing that many principals and teachers speak to me about when I am out at local schools. It was also the theme of the guest speaker at the Blue Mountains Vietnam Veterans Memorial Day march yesterday in Springwood. David Savage, the first Australian civilian to be wounded in Afghanistanâby a 12-year-old suicide bomberâspoke about his work with Soldier On. This is something we should be talking about and doing something about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly welcome any increased investment in this area. I note that the Nepean Blue Mountains Primary Health Network announced a range of new mental health programs that are rolling out this year, including headspace's Youth Early Psychosis Program; the Blue Mountains Aboriginal Culture and Resource Centre and Ted Noffs both delivering support for people who have ice addiction; and the Black Dog Institute delivering training for local GPs, practice nurses and general practice staff, to enhance their support for people at risk of suicide and those suffering mental illness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do believe that primary health, the first point of contact for people who are unwell, has a key role. Patients who are mentally unwell don't always keep appointments and they don't always show up on time, and that can create real tensions in the sort of treatment that they then go on to receive, even at a local level. It is disappointing, though, to see that, this month, referrals under the ATAPS scheme, where people in the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury can access a program of psychological therapy, will be reduced from six sessions per referral to five and to 10 per calendar year. People will know that those sessions can go by very fast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When people ask me about the combative nature of parliament, I point out that the one place where I see more alignment of interests and shared beliefs than any other is in the suicide prevention and mental health space. We all talk about the commitment to mental health this government has and that we have on this side of the parliament. That doesn't mean we are necessarily matching our commitment as well as we could. After working closely with my community on the issue of mental health over the last couple of years, and consulting with a broad cross-section of both providers and consumers of mental health services, I know that we need to see more services delivered outside the central hub for our region, which is Penrith, which is not even in my electorate. For people in the upper Blue Mountains it's more than an hour's train ride, and there is only one train an hour, so just to get to an appointment can be the best part of a day gone. In the Hawkesbury you can't even catch a train there. We are in desperate need of affordable and accessible mental health services, delivered on location. We need resources targeted at early intervention and prevention for young people, delivered on location. I congratulate headspace for being involved in the Platform Youth Services winter sleep-out on Friday night, but, if a young person did decide to visit headspace today, it would take them hours to get there from anywhere in the Hawkesbury if they didn't have a car. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need support and education networks in place for families of people who have challenges with their mental health, because sadly we are still not taking that holistic approach that's needed. Families, friends and carers are left to try to make do with the information they get on Google, yet we know how vital they are in the recovery and support of people who have mental illness, particularly at those crucial stages just prior to a major crisis or incident and just after people are discharged from hospital. We need mental health support in our schools so that our teachers aren't alone in the role of counsellors and psychologists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This feedback is mirrored by findings of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mission Australia youth survey report 2017</span>, which found that mental health and alcohol and drugsâtwo issues that go hand in handâwere identified by both male and female survey respondents as their top two issues. Nationally, 33.7 per cent of those surveyed identified mental health as the top issue, and 32 per cent identified alcohol and drugs. As I said to the attendees at the PTSD awareness walk organised by the Richmond based Australian Resource Centre for PTSD, these are not issues that governments alone can solve, but we can do a lot to ensure that services are provided in the places that they're needed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:54</span>):  I thank the member for Macquarie for those comments. I do concur with that view that it is difficult to provide all services in regional areas, and, certainly, I represent a large part of Australia. But we must do the best we can, because one in five people across Australia are affected by mental illness each year. That means one in five people in each town, each city, each workplace and each community. That really means that mental illness affects everyone in some way. Behind those staggering numbers, there are human beings who are suffering. It might be your mum or your dad who's struggling, or your son or daughter, or even you yourself. What's more, mental illness is costing the nation around $60 billion a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the member for Fisher, I applaud the excellent work that is being done by the government and communities in my electorate of Grey to help Australians with mental illness. We know that access to treatment for mental illness is essential, and approximately 75 per cent of people admitted to the public-health sector's mental-health-inpatient services improve notably.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Grey, I'm particularly pleased to have been able to deliver a second headspace unit in Whyalla, and now an outreach headspace unit delivered by the RFDS. These services work hand in glove with the already established Port Augusta headspace unit. I am hopeful of growing these services even further and have been having discussions with the Minister for Health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I also want to recognise the great work that other organisations are providing across my electorateâorganisations like Mentally Fit EP, the West Coast Youth and Community Support, Ripples in Whyalla, and the Local Drug Action Team recently formed in Port Pirie, who are meeting head-on the issues of drug damage and mental illness in communitiesâand government programs that are supporting mental health and related physical health and those on alcohol and other drug use and for social and vocational support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, many areas in Australia are experiencing drought or drought-like conditions, and it's taking a real toll on farmers and rural businesses. Farmers are also affected by mental illness. Each year the agricultural industry contributes around $60 billion to the Australian economy, but farming remains one of the most physically and psychologically hazardous occupations. For example, in farming we have a suicide rate of about 1.6 times that in the general population. The exceptional emotional effects on farmers battling drought are huge. They are seeing their stock suffer and the land they are on suffer. And it takes its toll on people. The mental stress suffered by watching your family's livelihoodâin some cases, generations of family workâfail is crushing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Wednesday night I called a drought forum in Arno Bay, which is on eastern Eyre Peninsula and is perhaps the epicentre of the worst of what is happening across South Australia at the moment. At quite short notice I had about 70 or 75 people roll up. We had Centrelink services there and rural financial services counsellors. I think it was a very comforting thing for the farmers and associated businesses to actually understand the latest changes that the government have made to farm household support. In fact, it was pointed out to me by the Centrelink officer that, if a farm qualified for all of the support, that would round up to almost $46,000 a year for a partnership. That is quite considerable, but it is a long way from rescuing the farm when it's blowing away. In these particular districts, we have had some widespread soil erosion across the Eyre Peninsula, and the eastern end has missed out on a lot of the quite substantial rain that we've had recently, and actually tying down those paddocks and alleviating that drift is the most pressing concern. But certainly, the mental health and the wellbeing of those people is first and foremost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The stigma of farmers talking about mental health and social issues and the silences in our culture are hard to break. Traditionally, farmers have just soaked it up. It's the stoic image. I think increasingly they are coming to recognise that it's not just them. It's their neighbours; it's their friends; it's their business associates. Many are in exactly the same boat. Coming together and talking about it is perhaps part of the answer. So I urge them to seek out those services that are provided. One of the underlying messages that was rammed through all evening was: do not self-assess. You're under pressure. You may not know all the answers. The government, through the Rural Financial Counselling Service is there to help you. I applaud the work of the government. We'll keep up the good work, with the support of the opposition.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'TOOLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:59</span>):  I too thank the member for Fisher for bringing this motion forward. Interestingly, this motion actually covers two distinct topicsâmental health and aged care. Both of these are critically important issues that should be spoken about far more openly and broadly in our community. Addressing mental health is everybody's responsibility. Everybody in the community has a role to play in ensuring that we live in societies that are flourishing and where everybody has the opportunity for strong mental health. Before being elected to this parliament, I was the CEO of two community managed organisations. One was a mental health specialist disability employment serviceâin OECD rankings, Australia has an appalling record of getting work for people with mental health conditions and people with disabilitiesâand the other focused on social inclusion and community inclusion for people living with a range of mental health conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's fair to also mention at this point in time that, when we talk about our First Nations countries, we don't talk about mental health; we talk about social and emotional wellbeing. I think we need to be very mindful of that. Living in a multicultural country brings very different views for many communities about how we work with and support people living with mental health issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mental health is certainly one of my passions, and I used my years of experience and dedication at the local, state and federal level to raise awareness and to ensure that the funding being put into the sector by governments was appropriate, timely and met the needs of individual communities. I can assure you that, during my time in the sector, the government that best supported mental health was the Labor government. It was Labor that actually gave us our first minister for mental health, and significant investment was made in that sector. It was a Labor government that focused on working with people and creating opportunities for peer support programs for people with lived experience, who have a vital role to play in being actively engaged and employed in the sector. Labor has a very proud record of delivering long-term mental health reform, as I have said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, in the by-election in Braddon, the Shorten Labor government announced that we would fund a new headspace for Burnieâa critical early intervention service that will assist young people between the ages of 12 and 25. In government, Labor increased funding for mental health by 357 per cent to approximately $2.4 billion from 2011-12 to 2014-15, compared to the $516 million provided in the four years from 2004-05 to 2007-08. It was a significant increase. Labor invested around $200 million over five years to fund an additional 30 new headspace centres, bringing the total number of centres to 90 in 2016. Labor also expanded the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre services that are delivered by headspace. They are vital services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the 2016 election, Labor's mental health policy had a strong focus on suicide prevention. I'm very pleased to say that we have a trial site in my electorate of Herbert that is focusing on veterans and their families. Our 2016 election commitments included the National Mental Health Commission's recommendation to reduce suicide by 50 per cent over 10 yearsâa significant target and one well worth working towards. Labor have encouraged the Turnbull government to accept this target but, as yet, that has not happened. Our policy was also to roll out 12 suicide prevention trial sites across the nation. We are very pleased the Turnbull government has since adopted Labor's policy on this very important issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also been pressuring the government to ensure that those Australians living with mental ill health who are not eligible for the NDIS receive continuity of care. This is proving to be a major problem. I am receiving at least two or three visits every three or four days about people with mental health conditions who are missing out. I would also like to say that mental health support should go from birth to death. We cannot safely assume that people in aged-care facilities don't need mental health support. They do. I urge the government to focus on that as well.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:04</span>):  I really want to commend the member for Fisher for this motion and recognise that he has an ongoing and passionate commitment in this space. That is something that we on this side understand and acknowledge. His motion acknowledges that mental health is a crucial area, which says it all. The government has made mental health an absolute priorityâas we have seen, it's a key pillar of the Long Term National Health Planâand has made a record investment of $4.3 billion, as the member for Fisher rightly says in his motion. I commend the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, on his efforts in this space and for understanding it very directly. We have seen announcements recently, including the Fifth National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan, which is a very sound initiative. That has been delivered by this government, as has been funding for mental health research projects as part of the medical research announcements. All of those are layer upon layer of what we are doing in mental health across the various age groups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a fantastic initiative is the Million Minds Mental Health Research Mission. It will provide funding over the next 10 years to support an additional million people with mental illness, through new research, diagnosis and treatment. That's one of the issues that I feel quite strongly about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really pleased to see the $82.5 million in psychological services in residential aged care. I think that is a wonderful initiative by this government. This is additional funding to support older Australians in Australia who are isolated and at risk. I see a number of those people in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will talk briefly about headspace, which caters for 12- to 25-year-olds. So many of the mental health issues that young people experience emerge before the age of 25, and headspace is one of the important services that we are making sure young people have access to. This is really critical in rural and regional areas, where there are fewer servicesâthat's simply how it is. The provision of this service for 12- to 25-year-olds is so important, because 75 per cent of mental health issues arise before the age of 25â355,000 young people have received services. There are over two million services being provided by headspace. One of those headspace units is in Bunbury in my electorate. Another unit I've worked hard on is in Busselton. Young people can access a health worker there, whether it be a GP, a psychologist, a social worker, an alcohol and drug worker, a counsellor, a vocational worker or a youth worker.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage young people in rural, regional and remote areas who don't have physical access to look at e-headspace, which provides confidential support seven days a week between nine o'clock and one o'clock. Those sessions can last from 30 minutes to 60 minutes. That is really important, because not everybody is going to have a physical headspace unit in a location where they need it, but so many of our great young people use the internet, and this could prove to be a very useful support for young people in rural and remote areas. I also recognise the mental health support we have provided to veterans. It has been groundbreaking in this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will also talk briefly about some of the additional pressures that reflect in people's mental health status about what is happening online. The member for Fisher knows well that I have worked extensively in this area. I see this on a daily basis for people of all ages and the additional pressure this brings to their lives. Finally, I acknowledge the extraordinary work of the Rural Financial Counselling Service that has saved so many lives in Western Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:09</span>):  I rise to speak today on the motion moved by the member for Fisher. In doing so, I would like to congratulate him and thank him very much for his advocacy in this parliament for mental health issues. I know that he has a deep, abiding and bipartisan approach to this. I congratulate him for this motion. I also want to take the opportunity to highlight the dire need for us to adequately establish and fund mental health services. I think that this is very much not a partisan-political issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been involved in mental health issues with children and adolescents for many, many years. I was very saddened in the last few weeks to meet with the mother of one of my old patients Liam, who, unfortunately, took his own life a couple of weeks ago. I remember him as a lovely boy, full of life, full of energy and really having a lot to offer our community. Unfortunately, because of mental health issues, he began to self-medicate. As an adolescent and young adult, he had multiple admissions to hospitals in many different places and, ultimately, as I said, he took his own life. I wish and want us to do things better. I know that we can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do congratulate the government on its recent additions to mental health funding, but I see this from a slightly different perspective. It's not all about funding, it's not all about money. It's about the coordination of services, it's about all of us taking responsibility. There is not a family in this country that hasn't been affected by mental health issues. I know that we can do things better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My own profession has to take some responsibility in this area. Pat McGorry, an Australian of the Year, has done a lot to establish mental health services. But, unfortunately, I do believe my profession has not done the right thing in many areas to provide ongoing and consistent mental health services for all Australians. By example, I know that there are many psychiatrists in the capital citiesâSydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perthâbut there are very few practising psychiatrists in rural and regional areas. There are very few psychiatrists who do outreach clinics in rural and regional areas. I think that my own profession has to really take a good, hard look at itself in this regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also know that there are very poorly coordinated services. Headspace is a good service for adolescents with mental health issues, but headspace's resources vary very much from place to place. We could certainly be doing better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also strongly believe that there needs to be much better coordination between inpatient and outpatient services. There is very little in the way of good ongoing case management for some of the most disadvantaged. I see this every day when I walk through the railway tunnel that connects Campbelltown railway station to the main street of Campbelltown. I see many people sleeping rough, many of whom I have treated as children or adolescents, who have mental health issues. They have very poor case management. It's not unusual for a person admitted to hospital for many different mental health issues to come into hospital under one psychiatrist and be discharged to be cared for by another mental health team who are not connected to the hospital mental health team and so on and so forth. So there's no continuity of care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So yes, we should have funding, but we need coordinated care and funding of that care. A lot of what the government has done has been good in thisâproviding connections between headspace, psychologists and psychiatristsâbut we could do a lot better. To me, this issue is not necessarily one of funding, but of coordination of care. I do strongly believe that, with all of us working together, we can do much, much better. Once again, I congratulate the member for Fisher for this motion. I completely support him, and I congratulate any positive moves by the government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

He has been a wonderful leader and advocate for mental health policy in this parliament. He is a great supporter of the Thompson Institute, in his electorate, which does vital work in mental health policy, and has shared with the parliament his family's battles with eating disorders. Like me, the member for Fisher has a determination to make a real difference in mental health policy. I'm always pleased to support him and value his friendship. I should also acknowledge the excellent contribution from the member for Macarthur, the member for Forrest and others who have made speeches on this particular motion.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's motion gives me the opportunity to inform the House of a suicide prevention initiative that I launched in my electorate of Berowra during the winter recess. It's an initiative that I hope will eventually be rolled out right across the country. Suicide, as we know, is a national tragedy. Around eight people die by suicide every day and there have been 109 suicides in my electorate over the last 10 years. As someone bereaved by suicide, I don't want another family to go through what my family went through after my father's death, by suicide, in 1996. As co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Suicide Prevention, with the member for Eden-Monaro, I have placed suicide prevention at the front and centre of what I hope to achieve as a parliamentarian. I believe that building close-knit, resilient communities is a critical response to this crisis. As federal parliamentarians we have the ability to build awareness and resilience. So I have made that a goal: to make Berowra a modern suicide-safe community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 31 July, I hosted a Lifeline training session for more than 170 community leaders from across my electorate. Participants included representatives from sports clubs, churches, parents and citizens groups, Rotary, the Lions Club, Toastmasters, the Scouts and other civic groups in our area. It was a special and historic night as it was the first time in my electorate that our local community organisational leadership had come together, in this way, for a common cause. And it makes me particularly proud that my community has shown such an interest in suicide prevention. Lifeline delivered a training program called Dare To Ask, which focuses on learning how to recognise the potential signs that someone you know might be thinking about ending their own life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in my maiden speech, since my father's death I have reflected on the week before he died many times. Like many families, we were always a family that hugged each other. But he started giving us all these very long hugs. Like many blokes his ageâlike many blokes my ageâmy father was very proud of his parking and driving, but the week before he died he just didn't seem to care. If I'd recognised these signs and known what to do, I could have started a conversation that may have saved his life. I want Berowra to be a communityâin fact, I want Australia to be a countryâwhere more people can recognise the signs and know what to do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lifeline's program provides people with that skill. It teaches us how to ask people the difficult question and how to respond to someone's answer with empathy. It also emphasises the importance of prioritising self-care, as daring to ask another who's struggling can be highly confronting. We are never responsible for the decisions others make, but we can make a significant difference if we have the courage to start the conversation and the knowledge of where to access help. Lifeline's programs provide people with those skills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I challenged the 170 community leaders who participated in the training to sign a pledge to roll out Lifeline's Accidental Counsellor program across their organisations over the next 12 months. Within days, more than 20 organisations had taken the pledge. Soon, hundreds of my constituents will be undertaking suicide prevention training. In 12 months, I intend to update the House on our progress in making Berowra a model suicide-safe community. And I want to put colleagues on notice. I will issue a challenge to all my federal MPs to mobilise their own communities to run similar suicide prevention programs. I believe that by doing this we can all make a real difference and reduce the number of deaths by suicide in our country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the wonderful people at Lifeline Harbour to Hawkesburyâin particular, Wendy Carver, their CEO, and Cutty Felton, who delivered the program on the night. I want to commend Daniel Mezrani, who very bravely spoke on the night about his own experience of being bereaved by suicide. On the training night, Cutty shared a story. It's an old story. She told the story of a man who was walking along a beach littered with hundreds of washed-up dying starfish. The man noticed a boy on the shoreline who was throwing the starfish, one by one, back into the ocean. The man was puzzled and said to the boy: 'This beach stretches for miles. There are hundreds of starfish. You can't possibly make any difference.' The boy simply picked up a starfish, threw it back into the ocean, and said, 'I made a difference for that one.' Trying to reduce deaths by suicide is an enormous undertaking; however, as the parable of the starfish thrower reminds us, in this space we can make a difference, one person at a time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  I too rise today to speak on the motion raised by the member for Fisher. In doing so, I acknowledge the bipartisan support in making sure that long-term mental health reform continues to be a national priority. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mental health continues to be a crucial area that needs our attention, because, despite continued efforts of funding and reform in this area, mental health remains a significant health issue for our community. I do acknowledge the government for maintaining mental health as a priorityâone that is a key pillar of the national long-term health plan, with its $4.3 billion investment. I want to acknowledge the commitment to providing more support service and increasing investment in national psychological support measures, including striking an agreement with the state governments that will ensure more support services for our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a strong and proud record in delivering long-term mental health reform. It's a record that I certainly do hope to have the opportunity to see continue under a Shorten Labor government. In government, Labor increased funding for mental health by 357 per cent, to around $2.4 billion, from 2011-12 to 2014-15. Labor invested around $200 million over five years to fund an additional 30 headspace centres, bringing the total number of centres to 90 by 2016. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember well when, some 10 years ago, Professor Patrick McGorry made mental health a key national issue. He not only began the conversation about an area of health that too often is neglected or ignored; his passion and urgency ensured that mental health was a key government priority and secured significant funding agreements from both the government and the opposition at the time. The focus on youth mental health and suicide was a particular concern, and the many headspace centres that were established as a result of Professor Patrick McGorry's advocacy became the formula with which government responded to youth mental health. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of these headspace centres is in my electorate, in Craigieburn, and it provides an invaluable service to my young constituents. It is run by Orygen Youth Health Research Centre and it caters for young people aged 12 to 25. It provides for them an opportunity to talk about their mental health in a safe space. It provides support and advice on anything, including: worries about homework; drug and alcohol concerns; relationship pressures; family issues; and just generally experiencing tough times as many young people do, and we know that from our own experiences. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is estimated that around four million Australians aged 16 to 85 experience mental health problemsâone in five Australians! That's a staggering statistic. Some of my colleagues have already spoken about their own personal experiences with mental health. Around 600,000 children and youth between the ages of four and 17 were affected by mental health issues and, tragically, 2,866 Australians died from suicide in 2016. Recognising that we need to do more, and in response to this alarming statistic, Labor put forward a mental health policy at the 2016 election with a strong focus on suicide prevention, which included adopting the National Mental Health Commission's recommendations to reduce suicide by 50 per cent over 10 years. The Turnbull government, at the time, were encouraged to adopt this policy but have yet to do so. I want to take the opportunity to not only congratulate the member for Fisher but also ask my colleagues in government to urge the government to adopt this policy as part of the continuing need for bipartisan support in the critical area of mental health. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an electorate, Calwell has the highest intake of refugees from Iraq and Syria. These people come from war-torn countries; they have seen indescribable trauma and been exposed to conflict, violence and death. These new and emerging communities may not be aware of mental health plans because of language barriers and cultural differences or, in some instances, because they aren't entitled to a mental health plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, members of our community have rallied to their support. An example of this is the youth-led, grassroots support organisation Colouring Clouds, which aims to raise awareness of mental health services and encourage young people to talk to each other openly about their mental health without fear, judgement or stigmatisation. Co-founded by my Broadmeadows constituent Anthony Luca and his friend Seamus Carr, Colouring Clouds collaborates with local community groups to create targeted services for those in the electorate and has a focus on the demographic of 25 years of age and under. One of the activities they have undertaken is helping Banksia Gardens to run an after-school sporting program at Bethel Primary School. They use a fun and informal setting to talk to young kids about the importance of physical activity, self-care, caring for your friends and being able to talk to people about your feelings without fear or shame.</span>

For many of my constituents, an increasing reliance on social services puts those already in a vulnerable position in a more vulnerable position, makes them more marginalised and, ultimately, makes them less valued members of our society. Ideally, social service payments should act as a safety net, providing enough resources for movement off welfare and out of the welfare system. But in many cases it is doing exactly the opposite. Low payment levels leave little room to move out of the welfare system, and an increasing reliance limits the ability to break through.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I raise these issues because I know that these are the issues that are important in my electorate. Colleagues, for every year I have been in parliament I have asked my community for feedback post-budgetâfor advice and for solutions. This budget impact survey is one of the ways I investigate, measure and report back to parliament. In this year's budget impact survey, social security was identified in the top of Indi's five concerns: 24 per cent of respondents raised social services as one of the top three issues and 80 per cent of respondents ranked social services as either very important or fairly important. Comments included: 'It's not adequate for the needs of many who are in the lower income brackets'; 'We are treated as numbers with little bits of money attached to us'; 'We are attended by a different Centrelink employee every single time, so it's often the case they don't understand our unique situationânor do they care'; 'Centrelink forms could be made much more accessible for us doddering old people to alleviate some of the anxiety involved in getting the thing right'; and 'We have a moral obligation, if we have a social conscience, to ensure we assist those who do not have the same advantages as others.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next Monday I will table in parliament the social security commission bill 2018. The objective of this bill is to establish a social security commission to provide the parliament with independent and considered advice on a fair and reasonable social safety net for those who are dependentâin whole or in partâon social security payments. This commission will ensure an acceptable standard of living for recipients of social security payments and whether the current level of payment provides adequate support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, today I want to talk about payday loans. For those reliant on social service payments to meet everyday living costs, a payday loan is an attractive and quick solution. Loans allow quick access to cash to meet everyday living costs and to pay unexpected bills, but increasingly they are being used to pay other payday loans. A number of constituents have contacted my office about the problems experienced by borrowers of these products and the targeting of the most vulnerable. Today in parliament, I'd like to acknowledge Sandra Blake. Sandra is a financial counsellor. She works with St Stephens UnitingCare in Wodonga and she is chair of the Hume Region's Financial and Consumer Rights Council of Victoria. I acknowledge her work in bringing this motion to the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My constituents support the government's proposed legislation to address the recommendations in the 2016 review of the small amounts credit contract law, as do many community advocates within my electorate. We know that without this legislation the high-interest, high-fee cash advances continue to trap people in the cycle of debt. My constituents are concerned that payday loans will continue to be inappropriately handed to low-income and vulnerable Australians while the delay in presenting this legislation to parliament continues. A loan of, for example, $120 in October 2017 has resulted in a debt of $1,159 in February 2018. There are many, many more statistics. So I call on the government to bring the draft legislation before the parliament as soon as possible in order to give consumer advocates an assurance that legislative change will be considered to address the increasing number of vulnerable people with loans impacted by these lending practices. I thank my colleagues opposite and members of the opposition for being part of this debate, but let's get this legislation before the parliament, let's get it voted on and let's get the changes we know need to be made.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="188315" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  I thank the member for Indi for bringing this motion to the House. It's important when considering topics such as this to consider the effect of debt on families, singles, the elderly and everyone in between and, importantly, what can be done to protect them from going further and further into debt. That's where I agree with the sentiments echoed by the member for Indi in her contribution. There is no doubt that being in debt, particularly when it involves high-interest rates, can have a devastating effect on people, especially families who are already struggling. Often we see those people seeking to borrow more money to get them out of that particular situation. But, sadly, that's rarely, if ever, the right answer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Borrowing has become a way of life for many of these people. Unexpected bills, increased living expenses and overspending can often lead people to make decisions that they would otherwise never makeâsuch as going to visit a payday lender, who is offering fast and easy money, or renting a piece of household equipment such as a big-screen TV. A 2012 study estimated that 1.1 million Australians were, on average, taking out three to five loans per year and about 40 per cent of payday loan customers take out more than 10 loans a year. Lenders often schedule repayment dates to coincide with the borrower's wage or benefits payments, leaving people without adequate money to cover rent, food or other basic living expenses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know for sure is that fast money, like that offered by payday lenders, is almost guaranteed to lead to a debt cycle. This is why the government established a small amount credit contracts reviewâto ensure consumers were protected and that lenders were acting within the law and not ripping people off. Currently, we are seeing examples of interest rates of up to 884 per cent on consumer leases and loans. The government wants to ensure that the regulatory framework strikes the right balance between protecting vulnerable consumers and minimising the regulatory burden on industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also evident that some of these services, particularly in the consumer lease space, are for some people their only access to finance to obtain goods that they need. That, in part, is because of some of the things they have gone through and the circumstances in their life. But one of the problems that I have seen in the hearings and the meetings that we've had is the issue of disclosure. Many of these people sign up to these contracts with little or no understanding of what they're actually signing up for, because the interest rates, fees and charges are not properly disclosed. For a personal loan contract with a bank or a major financial institution, there is a requirement that they properly disclose all fees, charges and interest rates in a clearly identifiable and easy-to-understand format. That requirement does not exist with consumer leases or payday loans. I've read a few of these consumer lease or payday loan contracts. You can't understand and properly identify what you are paying for. I have made that very clear to the minister in the consideration that is being given to how we deal with these particular issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recommendations in the report include extending the contract's protected earnings amount, introducing a cap on total repayments and introducing a protected earnings requirement for consumer leases, as well as for payday loans. Implementing these recommendations to ensure protection for vulnerable consumers is what we are seeking to do. We want to ensure that we get the legislation correct so that not only consumers are protected but also those businesses that provide the service are protected.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  What a cop-out we've just heard from the member for Forde. There were all the weasel words in the world: 'We're looking into it. We are taking time.' I'm going to put on the record today, as the member for Forde leaves the chamber, that it has been 1,102 days since the government initiated a review into the shonky payday loans sector. I am not going to listen to one member of the government with any more excuses, because today is the day when you've got the chance to acknowledge that there are 650,000 Australians being exploited and being taken advantage of by this reckless and out-of-control payday loans industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Indi for her fierce advocacy on this and other issues, because she is in touch with her electorate, just as every member on this side of the chamber understands what's going on in the real world. This government sits by and does nothing. Despite repeated promises made by the government, we've just heard the member for Forde say: 'We know there are problems. We know there's an anomaly out in the industry.' He also said: 'We're going to do nothing. We're just going to sit by and talk about it.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know from talking to people in my community and right across Australia that they don't want a government bereft of ideas, just floating in the wind. They actually want to see some concrete outcomes. We know that the government has the evidence. The facts speak for themselves. Families are paying interest rates as high as 884 per cent for household goods. Fridges and washing machines, which would normally cost $350, end up costing almost $4,000 from loan sharks looking to rip off vulnerable Australian families. Some 1.8 million Australian families are now financially distressed. It is a number which has almost doubled under this government's watch. As we know, inequality is at an all-time high, with stagnating wages and people struggling to get by, which has resulted in 650,000 Australian households turning to payday loans just to make ends meet. The time has come to clamp down on this out-of-control payday loans industry and to stop the loan sharks taking advantage of vulnerable consumers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't stop there. These shonky payday loan sharks prey upon the most vulnerableâwith 40 per cent of loan holders unemployed and a quarter of loan holders receiving more than half of their income from Centrelinkâyet the loan sharks go unchecked by this government. We know that back in 2015 the government established a committee to look into this issue. The recommendations were handed down in March the following year, with 24 recommendations on how we can clean up the industry. To even my surprise, the government announced soon after that they supported the vast majority of the recommendations in part or in full. The Minister for Revenue and Financial Services said at the time:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The final report has made a number of recommendations designed to increase financial inclusion and reduce the risk that consumers may be unable to meet their basic needs or may default on other necessary commitments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Implementation of these recommendations will ensure that vulnerable consumers are afforded appropriate levels of consumer protection while continuing to access SACCs and leases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite receiving this report almost two years ago and the government announcing they supported the recommendations, what's been done? Nothing. It has been 1,102 daysâand counting. Here we are some two years later and consumers are still being ripped off and being taken advantage of, because of this hopeless government's inaction and disregard for those who have been financially driven into the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Gerard Brody and the Consumer Law Action Centre for their leadership to see the full, proper and original legislation brought forward. The action centre is just one of many organisations working hard at the coalface to address issues. They are joined by Good Shepherd Microfinance, St Vinnies, the Salvation Army, local churches and many other organisations working hard to tirelessly clean up the mess left by the loan sharks. I know this because I've seen it firsthand, with over 50 local community groups and organisations joining me for a payday crisis meeting in Goodna, in my local community, earlier this year. We heard story after story about how loan sharks go after vulnerable people, ripping them off every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is something we can do to address this problem, but it requires the government to have some backboneâto have a spineâto get the job done. Members of the Labor Party, with the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, are committed to reforming this sector. We know that the parliamentary friends of payday lending under this government have tried to wind back the way the loan sharks operate and that the lobbyists who have seen this legislation are fighting it tooth and nail, but I am proud to say that Labor members have stood shoulder to shoulder with the community sector to make sure we see real reform. Time and time again we hear of victims being ripped off, so again I call on the government to bring forward legislation so that we can implement protection for consumers, not a watered-down version. Enough is enough. It's time for action. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  I am pleased to rise to speak on this motion on payday lending moved by the member for Indi. I can appreciate the concerns of the member for Indi on this. There is no doubt that many people in our society get trapped in payday lending, and there is no doubt that some of the interest rates are completely outrageous and, in fact, are a complete rip-off. I agree 100 per cent with that, and I respect the member's concerns. But we need to be very careful when we legislate in this place. Ultimately, no-one forces a person to sign that contract. What we need to be careful of when making legislation is not to deny credit to people who need it in emergency circumstances. There are many times when people in our society need credit in emergency circumstances. When we put restrictions on that, all we do is to create adverse and unintended consequences of policy, even though it may be very well intentioned and even though it may be done in the belief that we are helping people. If you reduce the limits of credit available to people you will simply deny people access, perhaps at times when they need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree that the high rates of interest are quite outrageous, but the reason that those rates of interest are often so high is that those loans have high rates of default. We've had some of the credit providers in the parliament, and we've had discussions with them. We've asked them: 'What is your biggest cost of doing business?' Their biggest cost of doing business is the bad loans that they have to write off. Sure, we could mandate a maximum rate of, say, 10 per cent across the board and say they can't charge more than 10 per cent.

                  </a>  Yes, of course it's easyâa maximum of 10 per cent, but all that would do is dry up the ability of many people to obtain credit at a time that they desperately need it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite live, unfortunately, in an ideal, utopian world, not in the real world where people actually have to survive and make hard decisions. No-one in this parliament wants to see high rates of interest on credit. As I said, I respect absolutely the position of the member for Indi on that, but we need to be very careful and think through the unintended consequences of any legislation that we bring into this parliament. When we put price caps on anything, no matter what that good or service may be, we simply limit the supply of that good or that service. It is no different with credit and finance. If we put a limit on what interest rate can be charged we will deny certain people finance, especially at times when they desperately need it. I wish there was an easy solution. We need to help people in this situation. The best thing we can do is to try to get the cost of living down for vulnerable people in our community. The best thing that we can do is make sure that there are plenty of job opportunities for people in our community. That is what this government has been concentrating on. We've seen, since the election of the coalition government, over one million new jobs. One million new jobs have been created under this governmentânot created by government but created by entrepreneurs who are prepared to take a risk to employ people. That's what we need to encourage to make sure we can raise the living standards of people. We need to make sure we get the cost of living down, especially in the energy space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But so many of my friends who sit on the other side of the parliament don't care about that. They would rather virtue-signal to the Greens than affect the cost of living. We see that the cost of the subsidies that continually pay for renewable energy are borne by the most vulnerable people in our community. They are the most regressive policies that we have. The costs of those go straight on the top of everyone's electricity billâ$3.6 billion gets added to everyone's electricity bill. If you are concerned about the cost of living, get rid of those subsidies. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I'm pleased she has joined this call. This has seriously been a bipartisan position. This parliament has seen a review and, today, I call on the member for Deakin, Michael Sukkar, to bring the draft legislation that we know has been written into the parliament so that we as a parliament can act to protect some of the most vulnerable people in our communities from shonky payday lenders who are there to maximise their profits at the expense of often the most vulnerable and those under considerable hardship. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hughes made some interesting points, but he clearly needs a history lesson here. This review was conducted by those sitting opposite. The draft legislation was drafted by those sitting opposite. Those sitting opposite at one point agreed that this legislation should go forward. We stand here today to call on that to happen this week in our parliament. It has now been over 1,000 days since the initial review into the payday lending industry was commissioned by then Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg in August 2015. In November 2016, then Assistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer released the government's review. She said 'the government supported the vast majority of the recommendations, in part or in full', and went on to promise that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Legislation will be developed subject to the Governmentâs other legislative priorities, but at this stage is expected to be progressed during 2017.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, it's August 2018. Despite these promises, we are yet to see any legislation brought before the parliament by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has led the charge now for some time in bringing forward a private member's bill which is word for word the government's own legislation. Reform could happen right now. The legislation is ready to go. But this government is refusing to act. Instead, those opposite are sitting on their hands or, as we just saw from the member for Hughes, standing up to suggest that somehow what has bipartisan support, what went through a review, will stop people accessing money in times of emergency. That is not what the legislation does. The legislation puts a cap on what can be repaid, not on what can be offered. The legislation puts in place penalties for those operators who seek to give a second loan when someone already has a loan. It puts in place penalties for those operators who would contact people without being asked to try to sell them a loan. It is a sensible piece of legislation. Instead, those opposite are choosing to do nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my community in the city of Wyndham we know how much this is impacting on people. We have four such payday lenders operating within a 500-metre radius of our railway station. They are there with their doors open and with cups of coffee for people as the vulnerable walk past to tempt them into taking out another loan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what people need to understand. Our CLC often does work in one of our mental health institutions. They found that, on one day, 23 per cent of the clients in our mental health unit had a payday loan and that 25 per cent of those had more than one. These are people who are incredibly vulnerable and who would meet any hardship claim. I would also say that there are already laws in place that protect people and limit them to paying 20 per cent if 50 per cent or more of their income is from Centrelink. I would suggest that, since that legislation was introduced, the notion of hardship has changed in this country. There are many people working full-time and earning what we would consider in this place to be a minimal income, and they need protecting in this situation as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the winter recess, I experienced a day in the life of financial counsellors locally. I was alarmed, but not surprised, at the copious number of payday loans locals have undertaken. I call on this government to do the right thingâto put aside their friendship with this sector and to protect the vulnerable in my community and across this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:51</span>):  I thought there might be a Liberal member willing to speak on this motion, but, no!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to start by thanking the Independent member for Indi for bringing forward her motion on payday lending and small amount credit contracts. I would like to acknowledge the good work she is doing in her community to help the vulnerable who fall prey to such outrageous practices in the community. Today I stand here somewhat ashamed that our national government has turned its back on the most vulnerable members of our community. It is now 1,102 days since the government pledged to review the small amount credit contract laws. It is 622 days since the government itself accepted the recommendations of the review, and last year they even went so far as to draft, prepare and release legislation that addressed the dreadful practices in payday lending in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, what has the government done? The Liberal-National government has done nothing to protect vulnerable Australians from payday loan sharks and unscrupulous rent-to-buy operators. Only a few days ago, my local newspaper screamed a headline that one of the suburbs in my electorate, Baldivis, had the highest number of personal bankruptcies in Australia for a second successive year. It's a dreadful thing that's happening to people across the country, but particularly, of course, it means a lot for me and my people in Baldivis. It is just more evidence of people doing it tough in this country. Many of the people in Baldivis have been caught by the resources downturn and left to their own means. There are thousands in WA and all over the country accessing short-term loans just to make ends meet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, we heard the report that 1.8 million households are now financially distressed and that over 650,000 families have turned to payday loans just to get by. We heard of a mother of two young children with a weekly income of $488 being signed up to contracts for whitegoods worth $1,600, with a total repayment of a whopping $5,824. We also heard stories of an elderly gentleman on a disability support pension of $456 per week duped into a contract for $2,041 on a consumer lease, with repayments going to a grand total of nearly $8,000. It's an outrage!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not as if both sides of the House are unaware of the problem of payday lending sharks or the appropriate response to it. The Turnbull government baulked on the independent review of the small amount credit contract laws. It reported in March 2016. They accepted the recommendations, they drafted the legislation and government ministers supported the need for this legislation. So what's gone wrong and why won't the government act? It appears that the hard Right of the Liberal and National parties rolled the assistant minister instead of rolling over the payday loan sharks in this country. The 'parliamentary friends of payday lenders' came out strong and showed the nation just who runs the country, and I can tell you that it's not the Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government's 1,100-day-plus disregard for the out-of-control payday loan industry is contemptible. In the meantime, while they dilly-dally and do absolutely nothing, households are forced into payday loans and face skyrocketing fees and interest rates as high as 884 per cent. The Liberals have a disgraceful record in helping consumers who are being taken advantage of by payday loan sharks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A review commissioned by the Australian Consumer Law Centre found that the number of Australian households with a payday loan has almost doubled in the last 10 years, to 650,000 people. The report also found that the average number of loans per borrower had jumped 45 per cent in the past five years, to 3.64 loans per borrower, and 40 per cent of borrowers have more than one loan. So instead of waiting around for the government to act, on 26 February this year, federal Labor took actionâwhere the government would notâand introduced legislation in the form of a private member's bill to reform payday lending and rent-to-buy laws after it became clear the government was just going to walk away from this problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge here, in particular, the extraordinary efforts of the member for Oxley, Milton Dick, in bringing forward the private member's bill, along with the former member for Perth. The member for Oxley has not rested in his fight against unscrupulous payday lenders and dodgy rent-to-buy businesses that prey upon the vulnerable in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill was debated in this chamber on 26 March. However, the Turnbull government and its members again demonstrated their contempt when not even a single Liberal or National MP bothered to turn up to debate the bill in the chamber. This bill is a word-for-word copy of the government's own exposure draft of legislation to reform payday loans and rent-to-buy schemes. which they released last year. Yes, we re-released the government's legislationâand they failed to support the very bill they had produced themselves. So I call upon the Liberals to get their act together, do the right thing by consumers who've been ripped off in this country and reintroduce the legislation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of this House will be familiar with my passion and my commitment to ensuring that this road link is built. It is an important road project for my electorate. It is an important road project for the people of Western Australia. But it is important to note that the funding from the Commonwealth government remains there and is available for the state government to spend to construct this very important road project. The funding is available, as mentioned, as outlined, in the federal budget. It is there and recorded as a contingent liability in the federal budget. In fact, the Australian government has made it very clear in the budget that they will provide $1.2 billion to the first WA government willing to build the Perth Freight Link by constructing the Roe 8 and 9 extensions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You'll hear all sorts of suggestions that the money is not there. You will have all sorts of weasel words from those opposite suggesting it's all smoke and mirrors. But the reason why that funding is recorded as a contingent liability is because the WA Labor state government is refusing to get on and access those funds that are needed to take 7,000 trucks a day and 74,000 cars a day off local roads in my electorate. That commitment isn't just recorded in the budget. A letter from the Treasurer to me, which has been provided to the state government, makes it very clear that the Treasurer says there is nothing preventing the current WA government from accessing the funding should they choose to construct this very important road link. On the weekend, the Prime Minister, speaking at the WA Liberal Party state conference, said: 'We remain committed to the Perth Freight Link. Our offer of $1.2 billion to build it still stands.' So there you have it, $1.2 billion is available to the WA government to build a very important piece of infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it important? It will take 7,000 trucks off local roads, it will take 74,000 cars off local roads, it will create thousands of local jobs, it will bypass 15 sets of traffic lights, it will improve freeway access east and west across Perth, it will save travel time and it will save 450,000 tonnes of CO2 gases as well. And, if you don't think there is support to keep the Fremantle Harbour as a working harbour and to improve connectivity to that harbour, just ask the people at the MUA in WA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You will have people say that there was an election fought on this issue. When I have raised this point in relation to the strong support in local communities, it's been laughed at, and incorrectly so. The people of the southern suburbs strongly support this road project. They are the ones who have to put up with the traffic congestion that this road project will fix. What members opposite don't realise is that the simple mathematics is that there was no smashing of the Liberal Party in those southern suburbs. What those opposite fail to recognise is that the swing to the Labor Party in the suburbs where this road would be built was less than the average swing to Labor across the state.</span>

                  </a>  There was a swing to Labor; I accept that. It was much less than the state average swing in those areas that were affected by this road. Why? Because the member for Grayndler, the good fellow from Sydney, does not understand the strong support that this road project has in my community. So I call on the state Labor government not to ignore the $1.2 billion that is there available to build this road, to create jobs and to reduce traffic congestion. </span>

That included half a billion dollars for public transport projects in Perth as well as funding for the Melbourne Metro, the Cross River Rail project and others. But in WA on budget night even the Barnett government were shocked by this announcement about a project that hadn't been advocated by them, for which there was no business case, for which there was no route, for which there was no environmental impact statement and which Infrastructure Australia hadn't even heard of up to that point. </span>

We advanced plans and projects like Gateway WA, the Swan Valley bypass, Perth City Link, the Great Northern Highway and the North West Coastal Highwayâa range of projects right around the great state of Western Australia. Not one of the ministers or premiers I met with ever said, 'How about we build something called the Perth Freight Link?' The WA Liberal government didn't even know what it was when it was announced on budget night. It had no business case. Its EIS had already, upon examination for Roe 8, been rejected. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a government that came to office saying that all projects worth $100 million or more would be approved only after they'd been to Infrastructure Australia. Here you have the state government saying that they had no design plans worthy of any scrutiny whatsoever. Although it was promoted as a way to take trucks to the port of Fremantle, planning had been so inadequate and hurried that the road would have stopped three kilometres short of the port. So, allegedly, it was about fixing congestion at the port, but it just didn't go there. This is a great example of how hopeless, inadequate and incompetent this government has been when it comes to infrastructure.</span>

The efficient movement of freight and people is essential to promoting the growth of industry and productivity within our region. For the local economy to develop, efficient supply chains must be implemented for efficient transport, materials handling and logistics. Exporters require the means of dispatching goods, including perishable products, by road, air and sea freight. Conversely, importers require the channels to bring in bulky goods, construction materials and supplies. The efficient handling of freight in my electorate, which is located in the northern suburbs, first requires it to arrive at Fremantle and then be transported into the Kewdale-Welshpool area and up the Tonkin Highway to where the NorthLink project is being constructed at the moment. This will create an integrated transport and logistics highway from Fremantle all the way up to the northern part of Australia, through the Perth to Darwin highway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We call upon Premier Mark McGowan, the WA transport minister, Rita Saffioti, and the state government to support moves to build the Roe 8 and 9 projects, to access the $1.2 billion in funding that the federal government has set aside for this project in the balance sheet and to support the project proceeding. The government has taken a very strategic approach to economic development, which goes beyond electoral boundaries. It will benefit not only the electors of one particular electorate but all Western Australians. We encourage the government to participate in this very important project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It will reduce travel times and congestion and provide sufficient productivity benefits to the economy and industry, and motorists and local communities will be serviced by the regional traffic movements to commercial industrial areas, such as Malaga, Kewdale and Welshpool, by goods travelling all along this corridor. It will provide sufficient capacity to handle the expected growth in transport demand and improve the operational efficiency of freight vehicles servicing the nationally significant intermodal terminals based at Kewdale and Forrestfield. Between now and 2031 there will be an expected doubling of freight and passenger air travel. A long-term vision is to cater for the traffic volumes associated with the projected future Perth population of 3.5 million residents, to accommodate this extra growth in population. I commend the motion to the House.</span>

I know it for a fact, because I believe I've spoken on it before. I was going to name the member for Tangneyâit's practically the whole WA Liberal members of parliament here who like to pop their heads out of their Liberal Party hutch to check whether the shadow has fallen this way or that way! They call it their own little groundhog day, wondering, if they keep talking up the discredited Perth rail link in private members' motions over and over again, whether that will change the electoral result in WA on March 2017 that saw the WA Liberals get wiped out of state parliament.

                  </a>  Well, I suppose there's something to be said for magical thinking, but I prefer an evidence based approach and all the evidence shows that the Liberals lost that state election and Labor won. And they won by a lot. Even yesterday, recent polls show how deeply unpopular the Liberal Party remains in WA. So you might note that. I remind all WA parliamentarians, especially the Liberal parliamentarians in their Punxsutawney Phil imitations, that it was the Western Australian people who turfed out an unpopular, erratic, opaque and fiscally irresponsible state government. This government had put the deeply unpopular Perth Freight Link at the heart of its campaign, and that's the result it got. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud that Mark McGowan's Labor team was handed an overwhelming mandate to govern, to get hold of the purse strings of the state's finances, which were, as we all know, spiralling dangerously out of control due to the mismanagement and poor economic decisions of the Barnett Liberal government. I think sometimes that the Liberals think they're born to rule over Western Australia, like it's some kind of Liberal fiefdom they can play with. Well, I think the Western Australian people are onto you mob. They got sick of the groundhog day the Liberals were stuck in that saw poor decisionsâlike the agreement between the former WA Liberal government, under Colin Barnett, and the Abbott-Turnbull-led coalition government, here, to fund the deeply unpopular Perth Freight Link. And as we heard before, from the member for Grayndler, it was a plan that had no business case and the state Liberal Party wasn't even aware of it. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the plan was well meaning. Any well-thought-out policy to get more trucks off the road and ease congestion in WA is worth a look at, but this plan was riddled with potholes and hazards. It was and remains a plan for a road to nowhere that stopped short of the port of Fremantle. There is no final link in the Perth Freight Link. In fact, a 2015 report from Infrastructure Australia concluded that the entire project was hurriedly prepared and detailed assessments were not finished in order to find adequate alternatives. There was no business case. Two years ago a Senate inquiry was unanimous in denouncing the entire project and made the suggestion that funds be redirected to other important WA infrastructure proposals, including a future outer harbour in Kwinana. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You might think that was game over and end of story. But then we had the election, and we were right in the middle of that. One would have thought this would have sent a clear message to the Liberals that it was deeply unpopular. But, no, here we are againâgroundhog dayâwith a private member's motion, having to refute a project that has been rejected several times in just as many iterations. What is it with the WA Liberals that they think they can just keep saying things over and over again, and maybe no-one will notice and maybe it'll make it right or appropriate? It's just nuts!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that we're here talking about this again today is ludicrous. The fact that the WA Liberals can stand here and try to raise this project again, when everyone knows it's pretty much done and dusted, is just ridiculous. Why don't you come in here and talk about important infrastructure projects that people in Western Australia actually like? How about talking about METRONET? You remember METRONET.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  This motion from the member for Tangney is a curious motion, particularly because it comes just shortly after the Fremantle by-election. The member for Tangney is not backwards about coming forwards on his views when it comes to the Perth Freight Link. In fact, we've seen him put big advertisements in local papers and <span style="font-style:italic;">The West Australian</span>. Yet, funnily enough, when there was a by-election happening in an area that would be directly affected by this policy, there was silence from the member for Tangney, no ads. In fact, not only were there no advertisements, not only was there silence from the member for Tangney; now that I think about it, examining the list of candidates for that by-election, there was not even a Liberal running. That's how badly they know this policy is regarded by the people of Western Australia. They wouldn't even put up a candidate in the seat of Fremantle because of their support for the Perth Freight Link.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The critical part here is this. The Liberal Party refuse to listen to the community on this issue. When we listen to the community, what we know about Western Australia's priorities is that, instead of spending money on the Perth Freight Link, the people of Western Australia want to see fundingâand they have been able to obtain it, through the support of a WA Labor government and effective representation here in Canberra by federal members of the Labor Partyâfor METRONET, for a third lane north on Kwinana Freeway, for the new Armadale Road bridge, for a new Carroll Avenue bridge over Roe Highway, for the duplication of Armadale Road and, of course, for fixing the dangerous Denny Avenue level crossing in Kelmscott.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, instead of doing all of those things, the Liberal Party's policy going into the election was: 'No, no, no. We won't do those things that the people actually want.' Their solution was to fund the Perth Freight Link, a road literally to nowhere, with no plan to get it from the south side of the river to the north side of the river, where the port actually is.</span>

                  </a>  The member for Tangney says it's all right; we can just rely on the bridge that's already there. Well, if you're relying on the bridge that is already there, you're not doing anything to resolve congestion, are you? The bridge is clearly a point of congestion in and of itself. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But then the state minister floated this idea: 'It's okay; we'll build a tunnel'âforgetting that one-third of the traffic coming out of the port is placarded loads, which means they can't go through a tunnel in the first place.</span>

                  </a>  The member asks, 'What does the MUA think?' It's interesting to think about the issues that are affecting the port, Member for Tangney. What are the issues causing congestion around the port? We need to fix traffic on the freeway, which is a critical point of congestion for any road going into the port, and that is something that we're now doing. We need to fix congestion around the port, and that is something that the state Labor government is doing, by seeing a dramatic increase in the amount of freight being taken away from and into the port by rail. That is saving a considerable load of congestion. That amount will continue to increase under a Labor government, despite the fact that, under years of a Liberal government, we saw no movementâin fact we saw reductionsâin the amount of freight being carried by rail. If you look at the truck movements on the existing roads, like Leach Highway, during the day we're not seeing truck movements like we see at some of Australia's busiest ports, where they have to happen all day long. There are other options to resolve congestion if that is the economical way to move forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that I would like to remark upon is the way in which the former state Liberal government proceeded once it was going ahead with this project. Despite the facts that this was a very contentious project, that there was no support from the community for the project and that there were other priorities, the government proceeded to clear the land that would be affected by this road, removing an extremely valuable environmental resource for Carnaby's black-cockatoos and for other wildlife that is reliant on the remnant, aged vegetationâvegetation which has now been permanently removed by the Liberal Party in Western Australiaâprotecting our important environmental heritage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one final point I want to make. If the member for Tangney is now saying that there is an additional $1.2 billion in the budget available for Western Australia, as gratifying as it is that the Turnbull government has finally realised that the state of Western Australia is actually a part of this federation, I say this: why are you holding the people of Western Australia to ransom by not delivering this money to the priority projects that it could otherwise be delivered to? Instead you say, 'We've got the money, but we won't give it to you.' Shame on the Turnbull government! <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  Good afternoon. Colleagues, in 2016, I lobbied the government to ensure appropriate childcare services for rural, regional and remote families. I sought assurances they would not be adversely impacted by the government's reforms in the 2017 omnibus bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In February 2017, I introduced amendments to this bill aimed at securing mobile services for regional and rural communities. While the government refused these amendments, they committed to monitoring the impact of the reforms on mobile services. But monitoring doesn't provide certainty of funding. Consequently, all the mobile services in my electorate have been closed at enormous cost to rural and remote families. And those services which have transitioned to centre-based child care have been forced to undergo an extensive and complicated consultation and application process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I welcome to the parliament Anne Bowler, the president of the National Association of Mobile Services for Rural and Remote Families and Children. She has been tireless in her representation to this parliament on this topic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />It's not good enough to leave rural and regional families under the assumption that one size fits all. I call on the government to report to parliament on the impact of the changes to funding of mobile childcare services in rural and remote Australia, and demonstrate to us that they are not really disadvantaged. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  The story of the Frankston Dolphins football club in the VFL is a tale of the survival of the underdog. The club was in a financial disaster, yet it rose again to have its VFL licence reinstated after 12 months of intense lobbying across the Dunkley community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, I was proud to be with Matthew Guy, Neale Burgess and the Liberal candidate for Frankston, Michael Lamb, when they were first off the mark to announce, at a state level, $650,000 towards television-broadcast-quality lighting at the Skybus Stadium. The same amount was also committed by Frankston City Council and, then, by the state government following Michael Lamb's leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are already hosting blockbuster games at Skybus Stadium, both in the VFL and the VFL Women's, and new lighting would be of enormous benefit to our teams and fans at Frankston and beyond, and potentially also bring AFL night games to Frankston.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was recently down there speaking to players at training about what broadcast-quality lighting would mean for them, their club and their community, including, as I said, the potential for both night VFL games and AFL games, supporting our local economy and businesses and aiding regional aspirations. At the moment, I am advocating very strongly to the minister and the Prime Minister about this funding from the federal government, and I'm gathering signatures for a petition that has been met with overwhelming support. Minister McVeigh has been a firm friend to the people of Dunkley in the past and, once again, I will be continuing to work with him to fight for funding for Skybus Stadium lighting.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  It was not until 1966 that federal representatives of Canberra were given full voting rights in this parliamentâ1966! Twenty three years later the first Legislative Assembly was elected and Canberrans were finally given the power to decide the future for their own communities, were finally given some semblance of equalityâfor the most partâbut not entire equality. The territory rights bill, which will be before the Senate this week, will argue in favour of that equality. There are 700,000 people in the ACT and the Northern Territory. There are 500,000 people in Tasmania. Canberrans and Territorians deserve the same rights as people have in Tasmania, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia. We deserve those same rightsâ700,000 of us.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past, we have been denied that equality of rights. In 2018, it is only fair that all territorians have the same rights as those in the states. It is only fair, and that is the issue that is being debated this week in the Senate. I encourage senators to ensure that equality is enjoyed by all Australians, not just those who reside in the states.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  Last week, Shepparton lost one of its great sporting heroes in professional golfer Jarrod Lyle, who passed way at the age of 36. Jarrod is survived by his wife, Briony, and two daughters, Lusi and Jemma. His love of golf began at the Shepparton Golf Club, where he caddied for his father as a six-year-old and worked on his game nearly every day after school. Jarrod was first diagnosed with cancer as a 17-year-old in 1999.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jarrod played in the PGA Tour for several years, which, as anybody who knows anything about golf and a world tour knows, is an amazing effortâjust to play on that tour year after year. He made a huge contribution as an ambassador for Challenge, an organisation that supports kids with cancer. Along with Robert Allenby he raised millions of dollars for children with cancer through that charity. The Shepparton Golf Club has held five editions of a junior tournament named after Jarrod, called the Jarrod Lyle Junior Classic. Tributes to Jarrod from around the world have come from Jason Day, Greg Chalmers, Ernie Els and Tiger Woods. And today, in the final round of the PGA Championship, Adam Scott dedicated his final round to Jarrod Lyle.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  Like many Tasmanians, I was shocked last week to hear that WIN News will no longer broadcast live out of Tasmania. Indeed, our news bulletin is, apparently, to be broadcast out of Wollongong. We were shocked about this. My federal colleagues and I wrote to WIN asking them why they were making this decision that, we see, is not in the best interests of Tasmania. Tasmanians need local news, delivered locally by local journalists, that's relevant to Tasmanians. Tasmanians only have two commercial channels and the ABC from which to get their nightly news, and they want their news to be relevant to them. They want it to be about local issues that affect them and how national issues will affect them locally. What we do not need is the news to be broadcast to Tasmanians out of Wollongong.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, my federal colleagues and I wrote to WIN to talk to them and to get some advice from them about this decision. WIN advised us that they're not going to remove any of the local journalists, which we were pleased to hear. We hope that's a long-term commitment, not just a short-term one to get them through this announcement period. But we are concerned that they continue to talk to people in WIN, in Tasmania, about how this will affect jobs in Tasmania going into the future. Local journalists often have a great start in regional areas and go on to do national profiles on national news, and we want to give Tasmanians and other journalists around the country the opportunities that they can get in Tasmania. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  Mudgee's own radio station, 2MG, has just passed an outstanding milestone. It has now been broadcasting to its listeners in the central west of New South Wales for 80 years. The Mudgee Broadcasting Company Pty Ltd was founded by Harry and Eileen Milton, Ernest Hodges and George Thomson, with Harry running the station from day to day. 2MG first hit the air in July 1938. Back then, there was a focus on playing old 78 records and broadcasting live musical performances to local listeners. Now, of course, there's still great music and syndicated programming, and local voices such as Craig Bassettâ'Basso', as we call himâand Chris Millsâor 'Millsy'âcontinue as local voices on air. Mal Rock runs the station and directs the programming, and he's ably backed by the team of Andrew Andrews, Dane Durie, Kate MacKay, Jenny Burrow and James Hughes.</span>

Our regional and community radio stations are vitally important, even in the era of online media. In fact, they continue to be real-time hubs of local news and community information via their broadcasting and their own social media platforms. </span>

And we're looking forward to many more years of great country broadcasting. Long may your terrific work continue.</span>

Even the member for Moreton may spread the word, because I know he is a ravenous meat eater! While my electorate of Swan is based within the Perth metropolitan area, we all rely on the success of our farmers across the country. The volunteering initiative is one that local butchers Brett, Di and Christian Simonds have set up to help our farmers who are struggling through the drought. The Simonds family run Executive Meats in Carlisle in my electorate of Swan. Their initiative will get butchers to set up a barbecue in front of their store on 1 September to raise funds for our farmers. They have branded it Every Butcher Needs a Farmer. The title of the initiative is fitting. Every butcher does need a farmer; in fact, we all do.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Drought affects the livelihoods of the farming families who work tirelessly to ensure we all have food on the table. The Every Butcher Needs a Farmer initiative is a fantastic way to support our farmers and our rural communities. I congratulate Brett, Di and Christian on the outstanding initiative and thank them for all they are doing to support our farmers. I am glad they got a photo with the Prime Minister last week to help raise awareness of this fantastic cause. I encourage all members to go down and see their local independent butchers and get on board with the barbecue on 1 September to support our drought-stricken farmers.</span>

The main opposition party, the CNRP, were banned and the opposition leader, Kem Sokha, is still in jail; this week we welcome to our parliament his eldest daughter. The media and civil society groups have been silenced, the electoral committee is stacked, citizens have been harassed, Hun Sen threatened civil war against his people if he lost and the election was a joke. A nonsense official turnout of 82 per cent was reported, yet the opposition boycotted the election. It is no exaggeration to say that this is a death knell for democracy in Cambodia.</span>

These are restrictions and asset freezes for regime members and their families. Australia is critical here given our close links. We need to work with other nations and show leadership again. We can bring together the signatories of the 1991 Paris peace accords that Labor's foreign minister Gareth Evans drove. We need to ask the AFP and AUSTRAC to investigate, under money-laundering laws, accusations that were aired on Al Jazeera. We need to see if the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme can expose the community groups operating here in Australia which are just pro Hun Sen regime fronts. We need to review the focus of our aidâhumanitarian and civil society aid, yes, but no longer support for the regime. At the very least, the government should apologise and promise not to re-sign the disgraceful refugee deal or send our ambassador to drink champagne with Hun Sen.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  Today I rise, in the short time available, with a speech submitted by my Your Voice in Parliament program where young people can submit a short speech on issues that matter to them. These are the words of Kinuko Suzuki, a year 8 student at Sydney Japanese International School in my electorate:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When I first came to Australia, I couldn't really speak or understand English very well. At that time, it was difficult for me to get to know local people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">At school, I began to learn English. We have three levels to learn English and my English has become better. I started in the beginner level but I have worked hard and improved a lot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Also my school is very important for me because now I am in Australia but I know that someday I must go back to Japan. In my school, I can learn the Japanese curriculum and also I can learn Australian culture. For example, we have integration between some local schools and our school. I met some friends. My friend in the local school is learning Japanese, and I am learning English, so it is very good stimulus for each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Some people think we go to school to study. I think that is correct, but I also believe there is one more big important reason to go to school. We can learn sociability and human relationships. At school we have many people with different characteristics and backgrounds. I think it is very important and interesting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a wonderful and diverse country. People have differences and we can learn good things from each other. That is why I am very happy at school because I can learn a lot of new things and also I can teach others about my culture.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  The Turnbull government continues to demonstrate a blatant disrespect for our veterans, which absolutely astounds me. The Prime Minister has ignored calls from the RSL, the Royal Australian Regiment Association, the Alliance of Defence Services Organisation and many ex-service organisations, veterans and current serving members, and the Turnbull government has continually and repeatedly ignored all calls from current serving personnel and veterans to include the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation into the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is essential that we know that the CSC is working in the best interests of current and former ADF personnel, and it must be included in the royal commission. Just before the Longman by-election, the Prime Minister reiterated that he does not support the royal commission including the CSC. The LNP Turnbull government has turned its back on our service men and women. Labor has listened, and we want to see the CSC included in the royal commission. Labor's shadow minister, Amanda Rishworth, has written to the Turnbull government's veterans' affairs minister on several occasions, to no avail, which simply shows just how out of touch this government is in refusing to act in the best interests of current and serving personnel and veterans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I have launched a campaign calling on the Turnbull government to include the CSC in the banking royal commission. I urge all members of our ADF, veterans and ex-serving communities to visit my Facebook page, to click on the link and to sign the petition. We must let the Prime Minister know that this is a very important issue for veterans. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to rise this evening to speak about an important event that I attended in my electorate recently, the annual Far North Queensland Emergency Services Gala Charity Ball. This is the fourth year that they've run it. It was held this year on the Eastern Event Lawn, overlooking our magnificent Cairns Esplanade.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, the FNQ Emergency Services Association raised money for the Far North Queensland Youth Assistance Fund. I'm pleased to inform the House that a staggering $36,000 was raised on the night for this very worthy cause. The Youth Assistance Fund was established in 1972 to assist disadvantaged Far North Queensland children and youth in their education, sporting and cultural activities. The fund, since its inauguration, has assisted thousands of our local youth to achieve higher education, to represent their region and state in sport and to advance their cultural ambitions where their financial situation would not have allowed them to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just wanted to take the opportunity to extend very big congratulations, both to the Far North Queensland Emergency Services Gala Charity Ball Committee and to the Far North Queensland Youth Assistance Fund for the fantastic work that they are doing in the area, and to everybody who was involved in making the night such a massive success. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  Can you imagine, Deputy Speaker Wicks, with a tight family budget and your wages not growing, being told that you will have to pay up to $500 to get a life-saving scan, all because the Liberal government won't fund a Medicare licence for the MRI machine at your local hospitalâand then being told that the money isn't there to support such a licence because Malcolm Turnbull has to shovel out billions in a corporate tax cut for the big end of town? That's exactly what's happening in Mount Druitt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a hard enough fight to actually get an MRI funded for the local hospital, only to see the funding for it cut by the coalition government in 2013. The state Liberal government, to their great credit, funds a machine, but Malcolm Turnbull still won't fund an MRI licence for the hospital in Mt Druitt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently started a campaign calling on the Turnbull government to provide the Medicare licence, because it is simply unfair to make people in our part of Western Sydney pay those huge costs up-front to get an MRI. These campaigns require people power, and in the last few weeks we've had thousands of locals respond, all wanting to send a message to the Turnbull government to back our local hospital. A massive thank you to everyone who supported the campaign to date. The fight isn't over yet. If you live in Chifley, between Mt Druitt and Blacktown, and want to support the issue, please email or call my office for a copy of the petition. Together we can ensure Chifley residents will have more accessible, affordable health care.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  On Saturday, 21 July I attended the Brighton Surf Lifesaving Club annual dinner, hosted by the very witty Ali Baird, with my state colleagues Corey Wingard, David Speirs, Holdfast Bay mayor Amanda Wilson and councillor Karen Donaldson. Club president Chris Parsons reported on another very successful season, which included almost 6,000 patrol hours and nine rescues. On top of this, the club hosted sculptures by the sea; the Brighton Jetty Classic, which is South Australia's largest open water swim; and the Australian Open Water Swimming Championships. The success of these events is a huge credit to the club, and these events are only possible thanks to the hard work and commitment of the club's volunteers. In fact, the club has calculated that the cost of paying these volunteers for their time would be around $250,000 a year. That's why I was delighted to help the club secure funding for solar panels to reduce power costs so the money they raise can be spent on keeping volunteers and beach users safe rather than paying power bills.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of my community, I thank the Brighton Surf Lifesaving Club for everything they do to make the beach a safe and enjoyable placeâand a very special mention to Des Staite, who coordinates the four o'clock swim and has clocked up 49 years of service to the club, and also to Craig Caldicott, Richard Warren and Kevin Watkins for achieving 50 years of service each. Congratulations to these incredible volunteers and everyone at the Brighton Surf Lifesaving Club for all they do for our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  Today I'd like to talk about this government's diabolical gifting of close to half a billion dollars to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation for environmental projects on the reef. I ask you to consider these facts: with no open tender process, the Prime Minister has splashed close to half a billion dollars on a tiny organisation with a budget of only $10 million, just six full-time staff and a board stacked with big business and fossil fuel interests. Not only is this the largest handout of public funds to a private organisation in Australia's history, but the foundation didn't even request the money. In securing the grant, the foundation beat out other eminent institutions like the CSIRO, which has world-class scientific expertise and a proven track record in managing large environmental projects. The diabolical facts of this case cast grave concerns, yet again, over the motivations and integrity of this government, so I welcome the very recent announcement that the head of the environment department has, in fact, asked for an audit of this money. The request has come for the Auditor-General to do an official investigation, as well it should. Governments must lead by example and uphold the highest of standards when it comes to the use of public money. The people of Australia deserve nothing less.</span>

Kelly O'Dwyer, for visiting my electorate in July to address the networking meeting of the Joondalup Business Association. The event, at the Over Board Cafe in Hillarys, was well attended by more than 40 local business people and local government represents from the city of Joondalup. The issues discussed included regulation of the superannuation industry and general corporate governance issues under the remit of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The issue of the new educational requirements for financial planners was raised and how this reform would be best implemented across the industry, taking into account the significant industry experience of long-serving financial planners. A constituent called for stricter penalties for negligent fund managers in the wake of the financial collapse of the Addwealth Achiever Fund, Richmond Equity Fund and Entertainment Fund, with several local retirees losing their retirements savings. It was pleasing to see a number of professional women in attendance, whom the minister and I encouraged to consider getting involved in the Liberal party. A portfolio in the areas of treasury, economics and finance was topical for JBA members, and I wish to thank the president, Max Wilson, and executive officer, Teresa Ritchie, for organising the event. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I'm incredibly proud of the deluge of support for our farmers that has poured out of the lower Hunter. In Maitland, <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercury</span> journalist Belinda-Jane Davis spearheaded what snowballed into a campaign across the national Fairfax platform in support of Rural Aid and Buy a Bale. Just yesterday, in Medowie, a six-week campaign, led by Councillor Chris Doohan and Ben Niland, culminated in an event at the Bull n Bush hotel. This community of just over 9,000 people raised a whopping $70,000, and a third of them were at the pub yesterday to celebrate that. Good on you, Medowie; you've really punched well above your weight. They reckon it was the biggest event Medowie has ever seen, and they've raised enough money to send seven B-doubles of hay to the bush, where it's needed. I'd also like to mention the many schools and businesses whose combined efforts are truly phenomenal. At Kurri Kurri Public School on Friday, the kids dressed like a farmer and raised $1,400âthank you. Every dollar counts, and every dollar sent helps, but most importantly, every dollar says to our farmers, 'You are not alone. Good on you.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  I rise to commend the efforts of Josh and Shelly Ball at L-Bo Butchery in Kempsey for their huge effort on behalf of drought-affected farmers. The Macleay Hay Run, with wide support from the Macleay Valley community, has raised around $100,000 to support drought-affected farmersâsome $70,000 in cash and around $30,000 in hay and transport costs. It is a great display of Aussie mateship. In addition, Kempsey Stock &amp; Land have become a donation point for locals to donate toiletries for the Doing it for our Farmers charity drive, and a big thank you to Samantha Hughes for that. Kempsey Showgirls Emma Mitchell, Issy Sutherland and Elizabeth Jackson organised a drought fundraiser at the Kempsey Stock &amp; Land annual bull sale. Tim Smith from West Kempsey Hotel organised a trivia night, so thank you to Tim and his staff at West Kempsey Hotel for that. This is a great community effort. People are doing what they can to help our farmers. But it's more than just the money. I know the farmers of the upper Hunter appreciate the support and the hay being delivered to them, but to know that people in the community over the mountains are thinking about them at their time of need is of great benefit to them indeed. Well done, Kempsey and Macleay, for a huge effort.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  On Sunday, 5 August, a powerful 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Lombok. The earthquake has so far claimed at least 300 lives, with over a thousand people injured, and has left a staggering 270,000 people homeless. That's more than the population of the whole of the Northern Territory. Meanwhile, further west in the Indian Ocean, at the southern end of the subcontinent, the people of Kerala have been hit by severe flooding that has claimed at least 35 lives, with many more injured. The flooding has led to the evacuation of more than 100,000 people, which equates to, pretty much, all the people in Darwin. These tolls look set to rise even further as more victims are found in the rubble of houses and buildings and are found far from where they were washed away. These numbers represent people living in our Indo-Pacific region, near neighbours to the north. In fact, the flight from Darwin will reach the Indonesian people in less than three hours.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Top End's Indonesian community, along with the wider Darwin community, have rallied to show their support with a fundraiser last night. They've raised $20,000. It is yet another great example of the generosity and helping spirit of Territorians. I give my condolences to the people of Indonesia and Kerala.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  Kareela is one of the wonderful suburbs that I'm proud to represent here in parliament. I'd like to inform the House that this coming Saturday, 18 August, at 10 am at Kareela Village there will be the launch of <span style="font-style:italic;">Kareela: Lucky </span><span style="font-style:italic;">&amp;</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Liv</span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">able</span>, a book by Elizabeth Adams about Kareela's history. To give the House some background on the book: the unique history of Kareela was written by professional historian, Kareela resident and Sutherland Shire Historical Society member Elizabeth Adams. This is the first time a comprehensive history of the suburb of Kareela has been published. Kareela was originally thought to be named after an Aboriginal word meaning 'place of trees and water' or 'south wind', and was originally known as Sylvan Headland. The book will actually celebrate 50 years since the suburb was renamed by the Geographical Names Board. Although the area was first settled in the mid-1800s, significant settlement did not occur until 1962. I am very much looking forward to attending the book launch, and I recommend that all my colleagues in the House purchase a copy.</span>

In politics, ethics matter and values matter. Investing in our children matters and is a foundation of a cohesive society. Because the coalition government has a plan for jobs and growth and to create more wealth, we're able to invest part of that wealth back into the future of our children such as through increased funding for our schools, like in every school in my electorate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Building strong children is much easier than repairing broken adults. That is why I'm fighting for a playground redevelopment for the not-for-profit Aspley East Kindergarten. They want to offer local families a safe and up-to-date outdoor learning environment, and I fully support them. I had the opportunity to go and see them recentlyâthey're doing a fantastic job. But it doesn't end there. We're also investing more in sport, health and wellbeing for our community overall. Whether it's for sporting facilities like those of the Redcliffe Dolphins, the Aspley Hornets or the Aspley Devils, or the Redcliffe Surf Life Saving Club or police and citizens youth clubs in my area, I am standing up to fight for them. I have also invested recently with Peninsula Power Football Club in upgrading their grandstand. They're a great little community club. They are very passionate and believe firmly in what they are doing, and I support them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  I rise today to speak on the legacy of Professor Patrick Troy AO, who, sadly, passed away on 24 July 2018 in Canberra. Patrick was a pre-eminent urban policymaker, engineer and academic. It is difficult to overstate his legacy for Australian cities and urban policy. Former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and my friend and mentor Tom Uren set a new course for Australian cities when they established the Department of Urban and Regional Development. For the first time, the national government was showing real leadership in making our cities thrive. At the heart of this effort was Patrick Troy, who was integral in the foundation of the department and rose to the role of deputy secretary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Patrick was of course also a true comrade. The son of influential Labor figure Paddy Troy, Patrick was a lifelong champion of progressive causes. He brought this progressive attitude to his work as a planner. He wanted to create cities where people could live with dignity and access the services they need. And this is still at the heart of Labor's approach to cities. We want to shape them in the interests of the people who live in them. This is the legacy of Patrick Troy, a widely respected academic. I am grateful that he was also practical. The former head of the National Capital Development Commission, Tony Powell, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Troy was ultimately a missionary, a pursuer of causes, a seeker of solutions and a tireless traveller to universities and associations around Australia, fostering groups interested, like him, in making better cities.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  I want to speak briefly about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and why strong economic management matters. Since the election in 2013, there have been about 1,740 new or amended listings on the PBS, representing $9 billion of government support for new medicines. That means that this government is averaging 31 new or amended listings per month, or approximately one per day. The recent federal government budget alone included a $2.4 billion investment in new medicines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of example, at the end of last month the Minister for Health announced the government will invest $250 million to make four life-changing cancer medicines available to thousands of Australian patients from 1 August. These medicines will assist patients suffering from a type of head and neck cancer, lymphoma and leukaemia as well as chemotherapy patients. The health minister also announced a subsidy for new PBS medicines for hepatitis C and diabetes. All these patients will now have access to affordable, life-changing medicines and save thousands of dollars in treatment costs per year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Governing is all about choices and having the right priorities. Unlike Labor, who lost control of the budget and then lagged in their listing of new medicines, this government's strong economic management ensures all medicines recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee are funded.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  Last Thursday the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for education and I met with teachers, parents, staff and students at St John's Catholic Parish Primary School in Dapto. This is a school with a long history in the Illawarra, dating back to 1839. This is a school that gives local Dapto kids a great start in their education. I'd like to thank the principal, Andrew Heffernan, for taking time to meet with us. I'd like to thank the school leadersâcaptains Isabella Toohey and Alexei Valentinetti, and vice captains Ruby Bain and Jack Coxâtogether with teachers Jeff DeBattista and Kate Thomas. I'd also like to give a shout-out to the parents and friends committee president, Therese Ly, who took time off work to meet with us that morning. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard firsthand about the impact of Malcolm Turnbull's government's funding cuts on the Catholic school community in the Illawarra. The government is cutting $17 billion from schools, exactly the same amount of money it is proposing to give to banks in tax cuts. Over the next two years alone, Catholic schools like St John's in Dapto will be hit with about 13 per cent of the cuts the Prime Minister is imposing on the education system. What parents, teachers and students are after is funding certainty. They're not getting it from this government. Teachers, students and parents right across the Illawarra, particularly in schools in Dapto, deserve better from this government, and they are not getting it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  One of the issues that we've been dealing with is the tendency of the opposition not to tell the truth when it comes to funding of schools and hospitals, and we've just heard it again in this chamber. The fact of the matter is that this government is providing billions more over 10 years for schools, and in Corangamite our funding to government schools increases from $40.1 million this year to $48.8 million in four years time and then grows to $63.1 million in 2027. That's record and growing funding from the Turnbull government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was my great pleasure to visit Oberon High School, in Belmont, a few weeks ago to present a flag and talk about the wonderful work that they are doing at that school. It has a wonderful spirit and ethos. It's punching above its weight in so many respects. But it's been badly let down by the Daniel Andrews Victorian Labor government. Despite the promise that a new school was desperately needed and the great hope that there would be funds in the budget for construction, there was absolutely nothing in the last state budget, except a very small amount for planning works. Shame on Daniel Andrews and the Victorian Labor government. Oberon High School needs to be relocated to Armstrong Creek. These funds are desperately needed. I call on the government to provide this funding.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  On Friday night I slept under the stars at Glenworth Valley Outdoor Adventures as part of the Million Star Executive Sleepout, organised by Coast Shelter. The temperature got down to six degrees, which was warmer than last year, I'm told, and I and the other 51 participants were well looked after by Coast Shelter staff, who provided swags and kept the fires burning. We were also well fed by Chef Julie Goodwin and entertained by Star FM.</span>

For them, sleeping rough is not an annual event to raise funds but a daily hardship that is not of their choosing or of their making. They include young people like Elijah, who spoke at the sleep-out. With the support of Coast Shelter, he is now a writer and working with Musicians Making a Difference. About 800 men, women and children are helped each year by Coast Shelter to find emergency accommodation, but four times that many are turned away.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coast Shelter receives government funding to help provide housing but no funding for its community centre, which provides nearly 50,000 meals a year to people who are homeless as well as services such as showers, laundry, food hampers, legal advice and help with energy bills and filling prescriptions. Without community support, Coast Shelter would be unable to provide these services. I am pleased to have taken part in the Million Star Executive Sleepout, which raised $57,000 this year to support Coast Shelter and to help the homeless.</span>

I'm co-hosting this special event with the Queensland state government minister Leeanne Enoch and Senator Patrick Dodson, the shadow assistant minister for Indigenous affairs. The roundtable will be a chance to discuss the path towards Indigenous recognition in the wake of the historic Uluru Statement from the Heart. Many Australians want to see fairness and justice for First Nations people and respect their calls for a voice to parliament and a national process of truth-telling and agreement-making.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is determined to give First Nations people a say in the matters that affect them, including through a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament, should the Australian people so decide. To achieve change, we need the community to come with us on this journey, in the dialogue and in the eventual negotiation that will be required, and it needs to be the whole community. Local leaders from the Indigenous community as well as leaders from the multicultural community have been invited to attend the Moreton forum. I'm very excited about the opportunity this forum will give all the communities on the south side to be involved in this process, and I hope it is a wonderfully uniting and educating experience.</span>

These students competed on stage at the Mandurah Performing Arts Centre, performing monologues from the works of Shakespeare before a live audience. Up for grabs were cash prizes, tickets to <span style="font-style:italic;">Julius Caesar</span> and the honour of becoming Canning's best youth Shakespearean of the year. The annual competition is about encouraging young people to take a risk, do something difficult, and build self-confidence through engaging with the work of one of the greatest storytellers of all time. Shakespeare is at the very centre of the Western canon and I want kids to experience that rich cultural heritage.</span>

The panel included professional actress, and Head of Acting at WAAPA, Glenda Linscott and long-time Mandurah theatre professional Merle Brown, who has been heavily involved with local theatre for years. The contestants came from schools from around the Peel region, including Frederick Irwin Anglican School, Austin Cove Baptist College, Pinjarra Senior High School, Mandurah Baptist College and a privately tutored student. Every contestant performed very well, but there was only one winner. Sharni Uchtman from Austin Cove Baptist College won first place, performing as Constance from <span style="font-style:italic;">King John</span>. Congratulations to all the students who participated. Thank you for taking the risk and performing in front of our local community. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this private member's bill, the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill 2018, brought forward by the member for Farrer. This is an issue that I and many of my constituents have been very passionate about, demonstrated through more than 2,000 emails that I've received, around the issue of live exports, since the footage was aired on the ABC earlier this year. In my two years as the member for Wills few issues have stirred such a passionate and sustained response from constituents. I was appalled at what I saw in the footage of the live sheep trade. I'd spent considerable time working with Labor colleagues on our position, so it was heartening to see Labor make the announcement to end live export. It was a good vindication of our ability as a party to get our policy right on this issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm by no means an expert in the policy area, having seen the footage over the past few years I found it heart-wrenching. I've been endeavouring since I was elected in 2016 to understand, more particularly, the policy direction of a phase-out of the export of live sheep, how that would work, how a transitional arrangement would work, and what it would entail. That's why I argued very strongly for an immediate end and complete ban of live sheep export during these northern summer months. Even as the overall review was underway and being conducted by the government, it was important that the ban take place immediately and, in the longer term, that an overall phase-out of all live sheep exports be taken in a timely manner. Both steps are now Labor policy. Mahatma Gandhi once said: 'The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.' And I think that's a pretty good yardstick for Australia. This bill, essentially, does these two things, which are broadly consistent with what Labor has been calling for when it comes to dealing with live sheep exports to the Middle East.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite many chances, the live sheep trade has been unable to demonstrate it is capable of meeting reasonable animal welfare standards. The Prime Minister said he wanted to take a science based approach but has chosen to ignore the advice of both the Australian Veterinary Association and the RSPCA. They both say, categorically, that live sheep cannot be transported to the Middle East during the northern summer period without suffering extreme heat stress. That's all too evident, and we have seen that. This is why Labor will put a halt to that summer trade and phase out the rest of the trade as quickly as practically possible. But Labor will also work with farmers, unions and businesses to develop a strategic red meat industry plan to help sheep farmers make the transition to a model which delivers more sustainable profitability. In addition to offering something better for farmers, Labor's plan will allow more value to be added to the product here in Australia, create more jobs here in Australia and deliver a better result for the Australian economy.</span>

                    </a>  How so?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  I'll take that interjection. It's about building abattoirs here in Australia, building up the chilled meat export trade and making sure we can export to our partners in the Middle East. That will take a bit of diplomatic work, you know that. The member's quite right: it will take a fair bit of work. But we're prepared to do that because it's the right path forward, both for farmers and for animal welfare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the push to prohibit live export in the northern summer months, the government's response to the McCarthy review has been entirely inadequate. The Veterinary Association of Australia and the RSPCA have told us there is simply no way you can allow the northern summer sheep trade to continue. That's why a future Shorten Labor government will act on the science and stop that northern summer sheep trade at the first opportunity. We will also phase out the balance of the live sheep export trade over time and impose the highest regulatory standards during the transition period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last election, Labor also set out a very comprehensive plan to protect animal welfare. It included an independent office of animal welfare; an independent inspector-general for animal welfare; a review of the Australian Animal Welfare Strategy and the exporter-supply chain assurance system; banning animal testing for cosmetics within Australia and the importation for sale of new products tested on animals overseas; and the provision of far more transparency and accountability by the Department of Agriculture. I would have hoped that the government would have adopted some of those policies and we wouldn't be in the mess that we're in now.</span>

                    </a>  Whitlam, Keating and Gillardâthe same old Labor will shut your industry down. Of the 1.7 million sheep exported last year in live sheep exports, 99.29 per cent were delivered in good health. Think about that for a moment. That's less than one per cent. At the moment, if you put 1.7 million sheep in a paddock, you will have greater fatality in than you will have on a boat. And I guess this is the interesting part: people who are captured by a television program and an email campaign, as opposed to people who have been around the sheep industry, are easily swayed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The live export industry remains a very important part of our animal export industry. And you talk about premium product. I don't mean to ruin your paradigm but we're not live exporting prime lamb. We are live exporting old wethers, who have had a wonderful life producing wool around the farm, and they're not sheep you and I would want to eat. They are certainly sheep that will hit the export market and will be very welcome over there.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were 10,000 rural Australian jobs dependent upon this $1.4 billion in the trade in 2016-17. These sheep also play a part in a very environmental-focused program within Western Australia, particularly in the Western Australian grain industry, where they are cutting down our glyphosate consumption because of their grazing habits. A lot of the farmers will use those, then value-add them and live export them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is paramount that we open many opportunities for our sheepmeat industry. Certainly, we need to have high-value cuts. Our open skies policy has really afforded that. If you have a look at an abattoir in Victoria, the hearts and the livers will be exported into the UAE within 24 hours of slaughter. What we don't have is that capacity in Western Australia yet, and if we want to move forward to opening up market opportunities, it's not just a matter of opening abattoirs; it's also a matter of having the air freight to value-add those animals.</span>

If he remembers the statistic I gave of 1.7 million sheep and 99.29 per cent walking off the truck, I can guarantee that if they come across the Nullarbor their fatalities will be higher than if they go by boat to the marketplace.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the point I'm making: if we want to have a government that's going to stand by the Australian agricultural industry, people have to vote for us. We can remember 1974 and the 40,000 cattle getting shot, paid for by Whitlam. In 1992, under Keating, sheep were shot everywhere. In 2012, under Julia Gillard, there was the ban on cattle. Every time Labor is in power, we see lack of markets, we see sheep getting destroyed and we see cattle getting destroyed. It's the same old Labor: they want to shut it down, they want to ban it and they want to tax it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:57</span>):  With the live sheep trade's long history in Australia, I can well understand why some farmers and those opposite don't want the trade to end. There's a historical legacy, but it's a trade whose time to go has come. Records show that as far back as 1845 WA was sending live sheep to Singapore. The more modern trade commenced in 1945, with 24,000 sheep exported. And things really took off when markets to the Middle East opened up. Two ships took 12,000 sheep between them, followed by 28,000 loaded onto the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cormorant</span>. Ships today carry more than 100,000 sheep a piece. So far this year 1.3 million sheep have been exported live. And, as the member just said, 1.7 million went last year. Despite all the noise, the live sheep trade represents around just seven per cent of lamb sales nationally. It is a significantâ</span>

                    </a>  Mutton, thank you. It is a significant, but nowhere near major, part of our red meat trade. There will be some farmers, particularly in WA, whose business models to date are geared towards growing the live sheep export market. They will need particular attention and care as we transition, as a nation, out of this trade. And as a nation we will transition out of this trade; it's inevitable in coming. Whether it's under a Labor government after the next election, or sometime after that under a coalition government, this trade is coming to an end.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind those opposite that the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill we're discussing today is not a Labor bill; it's from a member of the government. A regional Liberal member has put this bill forward. Don't sit over there and think that somehow this is a Labor conspiracy to end live sheep exports. This is coming from a member of that side. The fact is that, despite improvements in welfare over the last hundred or so years, those improvements fall well short of acceptable community standards. Standards in the community have lifted; the community expects more. The live sheep trade cannot meet those standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1985 there was a Senate inquiry that recommended an end to the live sheep export trade. The industry has tried for 33 years to get its act together and it simply can't. We're not talking about historical incidents of cruelty here. We are talking about things that happened last year and only months ago. When is the next one going to happen? Will it be next week or next month? The fact is that this industry can't get its act together because it can't make a dollar, it can't turn a profit, with good animal welfare standards. With the standards that require good animal welfare, the costs would overtake the profit that they would make This is a low-profit exercise. In the agricultural sector, it's low value.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Farmers are not misty-eyed. We know that animals are born and raised for slaughter. It is their purpose. They would not exist if it were not for our requirement for their meat. Opposition to live export is not a slippery slope towards compulsory veganism. There will be no enforced wearing of Birkenstocks or consumption of tofu. Opposition to the live export of sheep is an acknowledgement that the beasts we raise to eat deserve better than to end their short lives in filth and misery.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I represent a regional seat and plenty of producers of lamb and mutton. It would have been unthinkable 20 or even 10 years ago for an MP who represented an agricultural seat to speak against live export. But there is me. There is the member for Farrer, who proposed this bill. There is the member for La Trobe. That's an outer-metro Liberal seat with one or two cockies in it, I'd imagine. We are all opposed to this trade. Even the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, while not opposing live export per se, has made it clear he finds the current state of the trade to be, let's say, 'suboptimal', because his language would not get past the chair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not all farmers in my state are on board with ending live trade. It doesn't really affect them personally, but they don't like the idea of closing off access to markets. I understand that. But there are plenty of farmers in my state who do applaud the moves to end this trade, as they see it as forcing the sector to get more serious about value-adding and about adding a premium to what we sell and produce. Labor will get rid of live exports if we're elected to government. We'll phase it out. That's a welcome proposition for the next government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at some of the initiatives around youth unemployment, we have the Youth Employment Package andâone that I think works really wellâthe Youth Jobs PaTH (Prepare-Trial-Hire) that has worked so well for many young people who were struggling to work. There is no doubt the government's economic policies are driving confidence and investment, but it is businesses themselves that are creating these jobs. It is often the case that they are small to medium enterprises. We've seen this prompted in regional areas by tax relief for small business, the lowest tax rate for 78 years. We know small to medium businesses, particularly small businesses, often give people their first job and their last job, particularly in rural and regional areas. If I look at the free trade agreements, they have also helped to prompt more jobs growth in regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then I look at Albemarle, which is going to be building a lithium plant in my electorate. It is looking at five different trains of processing over time, processing between 20,000 and 100,000 tonnes per annum of lithium hydroxide. That's going to employ between 300 and 500 people in the construction phase and around 500 people during operations. This will have a 25-year life. This is a $1.3 billion project. I went along to one of their meetings, and the most important thing for the people in the room was the opportunity for jobs, even for other businesses that may be able to get involved in that supply chain. We've seen the requirements for plumbers, electricians, the refrigeration trades, the mechanical and metal trades, building and form workers, steel fixers, scaffolders, rigging, dogging, mobile plant operators, truck drivers, crane operators, labourersâyou name it, and they're going to be part of what is a really good project in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then I look at what Labor is proposing for places like the south-westâ$200 billion worth of higher taxes. They've already announced $164 billion in higher taxes. We know about the retiree taxâthat plan to stop Australians from receiving refunds of tax paid on their share dividends. It's a reintroduction of a double taxation, and it will hurt mostly low-income earners and future pensioners. It will hurt most of those people who've worked hard and assumed responsibility for managing their savings. We've got Labor's housing tax, Labor's investment tax and Labor's tax return tax. It goes on and on. We've got Labor's higher income tax and Labor's family business tax. We've got a savings tax from Labor and we've got the tradie tax. We've got Labor's growth taxâhigher taxes on business earnings. We are seeing tax upon tax upon tax proposed by Labor. That's what's ahead for people. It's going to be a very clear decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I look at the businesses in my part of the world, I see the numbers of those small to medium sized enterprises that, through the decisions and policies of this government, have actually been able to invest in their own future. That's what you see with small to medium sized enterprises: people who have the confidence, the courage and the will to go out and achieve for themselves. They invest their own money. As you know, they often mortgage their house and their car, and they go out and have a go. They're the people who go on and employ others. We've seen this repeatedly in rural and regional areas. That's one of the things that I think this government has done particularly well: providing the policy settings that have encouraged aspiration and encouraged small to medium sized enterprises to not only invest in themselves but employ others. I have seen it frequently. Albemarle is just one of those in a major business senseâa major new industry, a major new processing capability in my electorateâand I'm looking forward to the additional jobs that are going to be created on the back of sound policy decisions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="91219" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:08</span>):  As much as this jobs motion tries to say a number of things, it misses three points. Don't listen to the words expressed; note the things that weren't mentionedâthree in particular. As much as the coalition likes to talk about the number of jobs created, it doesn't talk about the rate of joblessness. The rate of joblessness under the coalition government, since it was elected in 2013, has hardly budged. It's been at close to six per cent the entire time. We're certainly happy for people to get jobs. We want people to get jobs. But, as much as they talk about the number of jobs created, they don't talk about the rate of joblessness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first point is the target they talk about, that they extol, that they said they'd beatâthe one million jobs target that they reached. How was that target created? It was the work of dartboard economics, where they just threw a dart at a number to work out what to do. There was no thinking behind this number. There was no thinking and no logic behind the one million figure. The logicâfor the benefit of membersâwas that in the member for Warringah's office, when he was running for Prime Minister, they went, 'Well, this was the rate of job creation under John Howard, so we must be able to do that again.' That was it. Dartboard economics, as I call it, is what drove that. When talking about the number of jobs created, they don't talk about how many peopleâ700,000âhave remained jobless for a long period of time. Of those, the bulk are in the jobactive system. The bulk of them are long-term unemployed. They haven't been able to budge them. That's the first thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing they don't talk about is the other record that is of deep concernâunderemployment. Underemployment is where people want to work more hours but can't, where people don't want to be stuck in casual or part-time work. They want full-time jobs. The ABS is recording record levelsâ1.1 millionâof those people. This is a serious issue for people. I agree that there are some people who want casual and part-time work because it suits their circumstances, but there are a lot of people who do not want that. They don't have a casual commitment to a mortgage. They don't have a part-time commitment to their bills. They want full-time work to be able to make ends meet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third thing that you don't hear those opposite talk about is the failings of their jobs programs. The member for Forrest, who moved this motion, bravely spoke about PaTH. Some $1.5 billion has been used to support PaTH and Work for the Dole. PaTH managed to get 5,000 interns in the last year. The target was 30,000, so the success rate of PaTH is just over 17 per cent. Of the people who go through Work for the Dole, 20 per cent to 30 per cent might get a full-time job at the end of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the figures and stats about performanceâthis is even in the government's papers that have been put out recently as part of the employment services reviewâabout how long mature-age workers are staying outside of work, it's not good at all. Two-thirds of the jobactive case load are long-term unemployed. Half of that case load have been on it for two years. The average length of time the hardest cases spend on jobactive is five years. Research suggests that those people make up the bulk of the long-term unemployed. This is a huge number of people. There is no suggestion, evidence, proof or inkling that the government is going to fix these programs. Instead, all it does is announce new job programs, one after the other, without actually fixing the ones that are supposed to be getting people into work. Again I make the point that, as much as they want to crow about the number of jobs created, the bigger focus in this country is to reduce the number of long-term unemployed, to get that figure of 700,000 unemployed down, to make sure that people are adequately trained for the skills shortages that we know exist and are holding people back, and, instead of the spin, to get the substance required to get people into work.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:13</span>):  It is sad that the Labor Party's lead speaker spent so much of his contribution trying to find fault with the current economic situation that we have here in Australia. The Liberal-National government have delivered significant commitments to have one million new workers more than there were prior to their election. That is a direct result of the hard work of Australian businesses and the government's setting the right economic environment for those businesses to take on those workers. These thriving businesses create jobs in Australia and give Australians the opportunity for work. Over the last five years, we've delivered personal and small-to-medium business tax cuts and more trade deals, which means more exports and more jobs. This has certainly been extremely prevalent in the Goulburn Valley, where every time we're able to list a new commodity in a free trade agreement we have farmers and businesses prepared to take advantage of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year was the best year on record for jobs growth and saw employment go to a record high of just over 12.5 million people. And, yes, there is a problem we have with the stubborn end of our workforceâit's hard to get rid of that bottom five or six per centâeven though in my electorate there are hundreds if not thousands of job opportunities that cannot be filled in the lines of mechanics, diesel mechanics, steel fabricators and food technicians, not to mention people involved in the standard agricultural pursuits of fruit picking and milking cows who also have opportunities to work in meat-processing plants. It's not clean work. It's not great work. But in my electorate of Murray we have literally thousands of jobs, right now, that we are having trouble filling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal-National government has delivered tax relief for hardworking Australian families. We have this basic understanding that the money Australians earn is their money, and we believe they should be able to keep as much of their own money as possible. It's a view that our political opponents do not share. They believe that Australians should pay more tax to enable governments to spend more money. It's a view we do not share. We believe that a new model will be a fairer taxation model. It will deliver lower taxation, fairer and simpler. We can only do this because the coalition government has this nation in a financially responsible way, with a surplus to be delivered at the next budget.</span>

                  </a>  Next year. In 2019-20 we will be delivering a surplus. This will be the first time that has been delivered for more than 10 years. The previous Labor Party government was certainly unable to deliver thisâalthough they did brag that they were going to deliver three in a row. They weren't able to deliver one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic plan by the Liberal-National government is working. In my electorate of Murray we are seeing local food processors and manufacturers investing and growing their businesses. But there are business costs and pressuresâcertainly in the areas of electricity and gas but also in the costs associated with water, which plays a huge role in the production of primary produce. Three milk processors are in the process of builds of over $100 million in total and creating over 100 new jobs, so there is a tremendous optimism in the milk-processing industry and, hopefully, that optimism will flow onâit doesn't at the momentâto the farmers producing that milk. </span>

This will be another investment, over $100 million, in the fruit industry, which will lead to more Australian jobs and a further increase in the GDP of the Goulburn-Murray region. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Already this year we've seen the Turnbull government prioritise big banks over local public hospitals and schools, and then commit in question timeâagain todayâthat this would be their focus at the next election. We've seen the Turnbull government prioritise grants to reputable charities but without completing any tender or due process. We've seen the Turnbull government prioritise cuts to penalty rates over standing up for workers' take-home pay, especially for some of the lowest-paid people in our society, and now we're seeing the Turnbull government prioritise self-congratulation over the real story, treating workers simply as a statistic, without giving a damn about any single one of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government try to bring facts to a debate about good, secure jobs, but all they ever bring are more smoke and more mirrors. So let's have a look at the real story of employment, and unemployment, in Australia. For a start, there are more unemployed people now, under the Turnbull government, than there were when the Labor Party was in government. In September 2013, there were 702,300 people unemployed. In June 2018, there were 719,000 people unemployedâ16,700 more people. We have record underemploymentâthat is, people who are actively looking for more work but can't find it. We have record low wage growthâsomething not touched on by those opposite, I notice, even though it's of such concern to the Governor of the Reserve Bank that he's mentioned it regularly. When the cost of living is rising faster than wages, it is workers and their families who feel the real strainâthey're effectively going backwards. Forty per cent of workers are now in insecure workâthat is, contract, casualised or labour hire. For people under 25, it's over 50 per cent. It makes it difficult for them to ever get ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This self-congratulatory motion, patting themselves on the back and popping champagne corks, talks about the government getting the economic settings right. But I think there's a lot more work to do. I challenge anyone to go out into their community, talk with local workers doing it tough and ask them what they think about the government's economic frameworkâparticularly that record low wages growth. Ask them what they think about the Turnbull government's priorities. I'll tell you what I reckon they'll think: they'll think the Turnbull government is out of touch. Instead of bringing motions to the Federation Chamber to congratulate themselves, why isn't this government taking action to ensure good, secure local jobs are obtained for all Australians?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has already announced a range of policies that will support workers and will support good, secure jobs and conditions. For a start, we will restore penalty rates in our first 100 days of government and legislate so that they can never be cut again. We will reform the definition of 'casual' so that it is used for the purposes for which it was originally intended. We will prevent employers forcing their workers into sham contracting arrangements to avoid direct employment. We will provide 10 days paid family violence leave for all workers who need it. We will abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, we announced that we will crack down on dodgy labour-hire companies that rip off and exploit workers. Tackling unfair labour hire is part of our 'same job, same pay' policy. A Shorten Labor government will protect workers and ensure they get a fair deal by tackling unfair labour hire, cracking down on dodgy labour-hire companies that rip off and exploit workers. Labor will legislate to ensure that workers employed through a labour-hire company receive the same pay and conditions as people employed directly, who might actually be working directly alongside them at the worksite. Labor's policy is based on a simple principle: if you are doing the same job, you should get the same pay. At the moment, there are too many workers in Australia subject to unfair labour-hire practices, often treated like second-class citizens with lower wages, worse conditions and no job security. For some workers, labour hire and casual work is a pathway into a permanent job, but for too many workers it has become a way of life. For these workers it's tough to pay the rent and the bills, let alone make longer-term decisions like taking out a car loan or buying their own home. That is not good. We need to look after workers. That's why Labor will act to restore fairness to the labour-hire industry and to protect workers.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:23</span>):  I am delighted to stand here and join with the member for Forrest to congratulate the coalition government on its record of strong economic management. The member for Moreton is right in one regard: there is no doubt that there is more to do. There is always more to do. Where he's wrong, however, is suggesting that the government has the wrong priorities. It's very simple: this coalition government's priority is jobs. The Labor Party's priority is taxes. Jobs. Taxes. It is as simple as that. The coalition government believes in creating jobs. The Labor Party believes in taxing people. Do they have a plan? Yes, they do. They have a plan for over $200 billion worth of taxes; add on the Labor Party's personal income tax plan, and that goes to nearly $300 billion. Labor's plan isn't to create jobs but to actually make people poorer. If you earn an income, Labor will tax you more. If you own your own house, Labor will tax you more. If you have more savings, Labor will tax you more. That's what the Labor Party's plan is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government has a record not only of driving jobs and growth that is unmatched by any previous government since Federation but also of delivering outcomes that are improving the lives of millions of everyday Australians across this country, because they have jobs. With jobs comes fulfilment. With jobs comes the ability to put food on the table. That is what this partyâthis governmentâis delivering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, the respected Melbourne Institute, in their annual HILDA surveyâHILDA stands for Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australiaâshowed that (1) relative poverty is at an all-time low, and (2) that inequality of equalised household disposable income has fallen each year since the coalition came to power in 2013. It is now lower than it ever was under the Labor Party. While the government's jobs record is nothing short of outstandingâwith the latest labour-force numbers showing 339,000 new jobs created in the year to June 2018, and well over one million jobs created in less than five years since the coalition came to governmentâand while this track record is, indeed, first-class, we don't take such past experience for granted. We do not just sit back passively or complacently looking at today's trajectory, as positive as it is. Every single day, this coalition government, right from the backbench through to the cabinet table, is working hard to ensure that this economy continues to grow and people continue to have jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is perhaps no better example of the coalition's strong economic management in action than the recent tax cuts for individuals and for the small and medium businesses of our economy. Commencing last month, this government delivered tax relief for over 10 million low- and middle-income earners. This is just step 1 in a three-step plan that also addresses bracket creep and delivers simpler, flatter income tax, to encourage the aspirations of hardworking Australians, enabling people not just to keep their jobs but to get better jobs and to get ahead. At the same time, there are now around 940,000 small to medium sized businesses, employing close to five million Australians, that enjoy a lower tax rate of 27Â½ per cent. These are tangible benefits, because they deliver jobs. The coalition delivers jobs, while Labor is just tax, tax, tax, tax, tax. That is the only plan the Labor Party hasâover $200 billion in taxes. Their personal income tax plan would make it nearly $300 billion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="00AMT" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms VAMVAKINOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:28</span>):  I'm very pleased to be given the opportunity to speak to this private member's motion which was moved by the member for Forrest. I do so because this motion speaks, essentially, about job creation. However, I'm yet to see any real and meaningful jobs created in my own electorate of Calwell. It is senseless to talk about job creation and economic settings as a social policy success story when the impact on real Australian lives varies markedly from region to region. Like so many of this government's policies, the impact is one of inequality and a growing divide in our society between those who are doing well and those who are struggling to retain a basic quality of life and independence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we're talking about employment, we need to look no further than what is happening in the electorate I represent, the federal seat of Calwell, and in the northern and western suburbs of Melbourne generally. Because of this government's industry and manufacturing policies, parts of this nation that have traditionally been the powerhouse of the manufacturing industry have faced significant declines in employment opportunities. The 2016 census showed that in the suburb of Broadmeadows, the heart of my electorate, unemployment was at nearly 16 per cent, compared to a national average of 6.9 per cent. That is more than double the national average. According to this government's own figures, by the end of last year that number of unemployed in Broadmeadows had soared to over 25 per cent. One in four people who want to work have been left without a job. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Neighbouring suburbs have been similarly hit, also. Coolaroo has 23.2 per cent unemployment. Meadow Heights sits on 24.3 per cent unemployment. For the city of Hume, overall unemployment has risen in the 12 months from June 2016 from nine per cent to 10.3 per cent. Youth unemployment, as a separate category, is even more concerning, with some areas showing close to 50 per cent unemployment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are numerous factors behind these growing figures. However, the closure of some of our largest and once-important employers cannot be overlooked. The end of the car manufacturing industry in this country has seen the loss of many jobs at the Broadmeadows Ford plant. The closure of numerous other manufacturers, many part of the auto supply chain, and a range of other iconic brands has made a dent in the opportunities available to our local workforce. In the 2007 census, manufacturing was the top industry for employment in Calwell at 7.4 per cent. This figure dropped significantly to 3.87 per cent in 2016. While I acknowledge some of the wonderful and innovative new businesses that have opened in my own electorate, I challenge anyone to explain how these dynamic but small companies can make up for the job losses in traditional manufacturing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The city of Hume is now home to one of the largest influxes of migrants, many of them refugees from war-torn countries. I strongly support the need for this country to provide a new and safe life for these newest arrivals and champion the role they play in strengthening and diversifying our vibrant Australian culture. Many of these refugees and new migrants are highly educated and highly skilled. However, they too face the debilitating prospect of not being able to find work. We need specific policies to ensure that their skills and training are properly recognised and their potential to contribute to our society and economy is better realised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are talking about the multiple problems of high local unemployment in my area, high unemployment also creates problems for my constituents such as the obvious social dislocation that comes with poverty, family breakdown, mental and physical health problems as well as the daily trauma that unemployed people face. That is primarily, in their case, having to deal with Centrelinkâwhich itself has had its workforce cut by this government and, as a result, cannot keep up with the demands on the serviceâhaving a Newstart allowance that is inadequate and having the charade of going through the hoops of job network services, many of which have no services at all to offer to my constituents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government and, indeed, this motion laud the assertion that one million jobs have been created since they took office in 2013. Yet these jobs don't seem to be finding their way to my electorate, these jobs don't seem to be making their way to the job network providers who are supposed to be looking for work for the unemployed in the federal seat of Calwell and these jobs are certainly not making their way to my constituents.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  I sometimes think that the things most important to my electorate, in order of priority, are jobs, jobs and jobs. That's why I rise to speak in support of this motion which has been brought by the member for Forrest. The reality is that, since coming to government in 2013, we've created over a million new jobs. Before those opposite say, 'They're casualised jobs; they're not significant,' I'll remind them that 80 per cent of those jobs are full time. Before they say, 'Yes, but you're not assisting with the equitable distribution of those jobs between genders,' I will remind them that the majority of those people who were successful in gaining full-time employment were, in fact, women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That in itself is a significant achievementâthat is a million jobsâbearing in mind we set ourselves that Herculean target when we came to government. But I'm more focused on the trajectory. In the last 12 months, over 400,000 jobs have been created. In effect, when we came to government we set ourselves a plan. We sat down, as anyone would, whether in government or in private business, and said, 'How are we going to achieve that objective?' We set about doing the things necessary: cutting red tape and establishing free trade agreements with the northern Asian powerhouse economies. And all of that has paid dividends. It has paid dividends in terms of job creation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Chifley was quite critical. He said, 'Yes, but the unemployment rate hasn't shifted.' I say to the member for Chifley: if we hadn't created those million jobs, imagine where the unemployment rate would be. Just like those on this side earlier, I agree: there's much more work to be done. I would love to see our nation at full employment, or as close to that as it practically could be. But to deride the efforts of our government, as those opposite are trying to do, is simply to find foul because they perceive that as their role in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this to members opposite: I have the great privilege of representing what I believe to be one of the greatest electorates in the country. I'm sure those opposite believe that they do as well. But one of the things I can say about my electorate is that on the back of the free trade agreements and the opportunities, particularly, to put food and fibre into our northern markets via free trade agreements, we now have an insatiable demand for labour. It is literally insatiable. There are communities in my electorateâand I can mention them; in the Tatiara and in other placesâwhere, quite frankly, what is holding back business investment decisions today is the concern that those investors have that there won't be staff. Those small and medium businesses that are working to fill this demand for food and fibre that has presented itself globally are reluctant to make that investment because they are worried that if they make this investment there won't be staff to work in these communities. This is a plea: if you are genuine about finding a job, then come to our electorate. Work in some of the roles that are desperate for staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can talk about the abattoir sector. Those opposite would know that an abattoir in my electorate, a significant one, recently burnt down and we are doing our best to make sure it's rebuilt. But that abattoir is a classic example of what is symptomatic in this industry across the country. Of the 1,500 workers at that site, 1,000 of them were foreign workers. That's not because the operators of that abattoir had a penchant towards employing foreign labour, despite what the union tries to suggest, but, rather, because they cannot source workers to work in that industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I say is that we have met our target. We set ourselves the Herculean target of a million jobs. We achieved that target and the trajectory is accelerating, which is always good news, but there is more to do. We acknowledge that there is more to do, because we won't be satisfied until we've got as close to the natural rate of unemployment in this country as we practically can. I ask those opposite, who'd rather spend their time bemoaning the achievement, to work with us, to see if we can go even deeper into this long list of unemployed Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:38</span>):  This is typical of this government: self-congratulations while most Australians are struggling to make ends meet. There are plenty of families in Australia who I know that have gone onto repayment plans with their electricity provider because they simply can't afford to pay the bill on a quarterly basis anymore because of the skyrocketing electricity prices that they face. It's winter and there are plenty of pensioners in my electorate who can't afford to turn the heater on this winter because they simply can't afford the increase in energy prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this lot here want to come into this chamber and congratulate themselves through this motion. Why have electricity prices been increasing? Because this government are worried more about themselves and their internal bickering than the interests of Australian families, small businesses and pensioners. Those opposite have been in government for five years. The pyramids were built in less time than this mob have been in government, yet they can't decide on an energy policy. They're still bickering over whether or not they'll agree to the National Energy Guarantee. The latest roundâI think we're up to about round 14 nowâis going to take place tomorrow morning, when the Prime Minister will be pitted against the likes of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott and former leader of the National Party Barnaby Joyce. We'll await the outcome and the rest of Australia will continue to deal with their increasing electricity prices while this lot argue amongst themselves about the division and about their policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They dismantled the policies of the previous government, which were ensuring that we made a smooth transition to a cleaner energy future and that we kept a lid on energy prices. Remember when they said that energy prices would go down by $550 when they were elected? Energy prices have actually done the opposite and gone up. Those opposite still don't have a policy to deal with this issue, yet they want to come into this chamber and congratulate themselves through this motion. Families are dealing with cost-of-living pressures associated with private health insurance, with increasing childcare costs and with the cuts that this government has introduced to funding for schools and hospitals, and yet those opposite come to Canberra to congratulate themselves. It proves just how out of touch they are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of living is increasing. Australians' incomes haven't kept pace with the cost of living and inflation over the last decade. Real incomes in Australia are falling, and Australian families and workers are suffering. The wage price index is stuck stubbornly at around 1.9 per cent to two per cent and the cost of living for households over the last 12 months has risen by 2.3 per cent, to June 2018, yet they're cutting penalty rates. They're supporting cuts to penalty rates for working on weekends for some of the lowest paid workers. So we've got the cost of living increasing, real wages decreasing and cuts to penalty rates being cheered on by the Turnbull government, and those opposite come in here and congratulate themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion doesn't once mention the real incomes of Australian workers. It doesn't mention the living standards of Australian workers. Does it mention the battle of Australian workers and their families with electricity prices and other household costs? No. It's all about them. The motion doesn't mention their tax cuts to big business, either. At the same time that families are struggling with cost-of-living pressures and trying to make ends meet, this motion talks about giving tax cuts to big business in this country. That includes the big Australian banks. Haven't they done a wonderful job by the Australian people over the last decade! Haven't they been out there in the interests of Australian workers and their families! It says everything about how out of touch those in this government really are that they come here to Canberra, to the ivory tower, and congratulate themselves on their policies to cut taxes for corporations yet make no mention of the living standards of Australians and the cost-of-living pressure that the average Australian worker and their family are facing. It proves just how out of touch they are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They spruik these corporate tax cuts. The evidence from the United States, where these corporate tax cuts have gone through, is that workers got not one dime of the benefits of those corporate tax cuts. They all went into profits and the pockets of shareholders and executives in America. American workers did not receive a cent. At the same time, the budget deficit in the United States has blown out. It is forecast to blow out to over a trillion dollars, or five per cent of GDP. We don't want to go down that track here in Australia. If this government were interested and in touch, they'd be talking about the interests of Australian workers and families.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247742" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOWARTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  That was a nice speech by the shadow minister, the member for Kingsford Smith, but it was very inaccurate. If he actually looked at the statistics for the last 12 months, he would see that all the job creation has been created in businesses with a turnover of less than $50 million. Is that any coincidence, given that the company tax rate has been reduced for businesses with a turnover of under $50 million? I think not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I rise to speak on the motion on job creation moved by the member for Forrest. It's a good motion. It talks about the million jobs that have been created in Australia over the last five years, with 400,000 or more in the last 12 months. That was an election commitment the coalition government took to the election in 2013. It's now been achieved and it should be celebrated. It's a good thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I will say it wasn't by accident that that happened. There was a clear plan to create more jobs. That was reinforced at the 2016 electionâjob creation and economic growth is what we campaigned on. The plan involved company tax reductions in order to bring us into line with other countries around the world and here in Asia, where it's much lower. It involved the defence manufacturing plan to create more jobs in manufacturing in our defence industry. It involved free trade agreements for our farmers and other people to make sure they have the opportunity to turbocharge exports and send more goods and services overseas. It also involved innovation. We've seen companies like the Evolve Group, which started in my electorate of Petrie, reshoring manufacturing jobs from China back to Australia. The Evolve Group have just won a contract to make plastic bottle tops for water bottles that they sell in Woolworths. That is $2 million a yearâgreat news. So it wasn't an accident that a million jobs were createdâand the member for Forrest is right that we need to talk about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I myself have been running jobseeker boot camps in my electorate. The last one was on 25 July. I had the Minister for Jobs and Innovation, Michaelia Cash, come up for that. It was good to have her there. I get local people looking for work and I connect them with employers that employ more than five people. It's really a simple question. I say to the employer: 'Mate, you employ more than five people. What is it that you look for when you're hiring? Tell the people here looking for work.' They hear it straight from the horse's mouth and it encourages a lot of people to get work. One of the speakers, Michael Kennedy, spoke about a number of things. The first thing he said is, 'If you're looking for work, be drug and alcohol free.' The second thing he said is to make sure that you're on time, that you're ready, that you're committed and that you're not taking sick days when they're not needed. He said you need to be really ready and engaged. The third thing he spoke about was caring about the work you're performing. He gave some really good tips to those jobseekers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, one of the guys that Michael hired, going back some time ago, got his job after I met him through the Work for the Dole scheme. I went down to the local Police Citizens Youth Club, met all the Work for the Dole participants and asked: 'How are you, ladies and gentlemen? What is it that you want to do? What sort of work are you looking for?' This young man said, 'I'd love to work with timber.' I knew Michael Kennedy, from Kennedy's Timber, so I said: 'Let me give this guy a ring for you and see what he's got.' Do you know what? He got a job. What was more impressive is that he worked for him on a casual basis for about nine months and then it slowed down and he got laid off, but that young man then kept ringing Michael, asking, 'Have you got any work?' He was then put back on and he has had a full-time job now for three years. So that's really good news. That was a great experience in my own electorate where Work for the Dole has been working well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to those opposite that we need bipartisan support in relation to work. When you look at our plan, you can see we have a clear plan for jobsâwhat I just spoke about. The member for Moreton spoke about his plan for jobs. That plan revolved around what the unions want in this country. It was nothing to do with what's best for those unemployed but, rather, what's best for the unions. He spoke about restoring penalty rates. Penalty rates are set by the Fair Work Commission, which Bill Shorten created after Work Choices. He spoke about redefining 'casual' in the workplace. Unfortunately, I don't have enough time now, but I'll come back to this because there are important points that need to be made here. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </span>I rise to support this motion on home-care packages. This is an issue that resonates across Australia, but particularly in my electorate of Mayo. Mayo is the oldest electorate in South Australia and the eighth oldest in the nation. Our median age is 46 years, and one in four people in my community are aged over 65. Given the rural nature of much of my electorate, many of those people feel quite isolated. The government's mismanagement of home-care packages is something that I and many others have spoken on at length previously in this place. I can tell you that the conversations are not just being had in this chamber; they are also being had in our community. I spoke with hundreds of older Australians during the recent by-election campaign. The message I received was one of concern: a concern about whether they would be able to receive appropriate levels of care when the time came and concern over whether the government was willing to do anything about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In May this year, the Minister for Aged Care visited Mayo at my invitation, and I'm very appreciative of the minister's visit. I wanted the minister to speak with members of my community who were worried about waiting lists for home-care packages and who were worried about the standard of care in residential-care facilities. Together we held a community forum in Victor Harbor, where the median age is 59 years. Two in five people in my Victor Harbor community are aged over 65, and home-care packages and their waiting lists were high on the agenda. At this forum, the minister told those in attendance that the waiting list is over 102,000 people longâthat's 102,000 elderly Australiansâand it's growing by the day. Disturbingly, he told them that providing more home-care packages would be very costly and the government simply does not have the money to allocate towards eradicating the waiting list. His final message was that if you are offered a package, even if it is below the level of care you requireâthat you have been assessed forâyou must take it or risk being put at the back of the line. I think we can all imagine the concern that swept over the audience when this message was delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's inability to manage the growing waiting list is deeply concerning. Delivering 14,000 home-care packages over four years will not even begin to address this shortfall. The list grew by over 20,000 people in the six months between July and December last year. And, if this trend continues, the list will have grown by over 160,000 older Australians by the time the 14,000 packages are delivered. They announced this measure in the budget as a serious investment in aged care, yet it is so disappointing because so much more needs to be done. While I appreciate the minister's candour when he explained that there simply isn't enough money to fund the growing number of people waiting for home-care packages, I don't believe it is a good enough answer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most frustrating part of the government's inaction in this matter is that investment in home-care packages is a smart spend. Help for older Australians within their home, to live longer within their homeâand they should have the choice to do that because it's what they want to doâis actually a cost saving to government. It's a cost saving to taxpayers. So we are wasting money by not supporting people to be in their home. It means that they more quickly actually end up in a nursing home or a residential aged-care facility, and that is far more costly and not where people want to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The facts are clear. The government has created an aged-care crisis in this nation, and it is getting worse. I have previously spoken of a constituent who told me of an elderly resident they were assisting to secure a home-care package. She told me that when the call finally came through that a package was available, the recipient had already died. This is the situation the government has created. This is one of hundreds of situations. I have heard of elderly people in their 90s. One gentleman could hardly move and was handwashing his wife of 70 years. With a call to my office, we were able to get him bumped up the queue and they now have a package, but it should not get to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that this government's inaction on this matter needs to be addressed urgently. This should be front-page newspaper material, and it's not. I can offer to my community my pledge that I will continue to apply pressure to the government, to hold the government to account, to provide adequate aged-care support that extends beyond home-care packages and includes residential and respite care as well. Older Australians built this nation and they deserve, in their elder years, to be properly supported by our nation. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  You know how desperate things are in a sector when someone who gets very little sleep because she works in aged care and is also a full-time carer for her mum makes the time to be part of a local forum with some politicians, giving up the only moment of free time that she gets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The members for Newcastle and Macarthur held a hearing of the Medicare Taskforce in the electorate that I represent, Macquarie, focusing on aged care. It's fair to say that we had a full house in Katoomba, with people who have gone through the process of helping an elderly family member, whether it's a mum or a dad, a relative or a partner, to tackle the bureaucracy to get an aged-care home package.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The room full of people sat in stunned silence as we took evidence by phone from Anthea Cox-Norman, an aged-care nurse who lives in Hobartville, who shared with us her experience in trying to get the appropriate level of home care for her mum. She works nights and cares for her mum during the day. She needs help. We first started speaking with Anthea in March, when she rang concerned that, despite the fact that her mum had been discharged from hospital into Anthea's care in early January, they had been advised of a nine- to 12-month wait for an in-home-care package. Her mum's needs had been assessed as meeting level 4 needsâthat's the highest level of care. Anthea is at breaking point, as anyone would be when trying to do two full-time roles without adequate support. I wrote to the minister about this in early July after exhausting all other avenues, and there's still no response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the evidence from the forum tells us is that Anthea is not alone in experiencing long delays for care for a loved one. One of the key issues that emerged is that so many people give up on the wait and accept a package that is at a lower level of care and then find themselves facing big bills in trying to fill the gaps. The cost of that extra care can be a real shock and financially devastating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have an electorate with many retired and elderly people. In fact, people move to the area in order to retire and to breathe our clean air after living and working in their busy lives. It's completely understandable that people want to be able to age in their own home, in their own space, for as long as they can. The delays in home-care packages have caused grief for many, and I have heard the same story over and over again: that someone was on the waiting list but their package didn't come through until they were just about to be admitted to residential care or, in several cases, the person needing the care had already died.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a disgrace that we show so little respect for the older and more vulnerable members of our community. It seems bizarre to me that it is now August and we are well overdue for an update on the current waiting list. The Department of Health has previously committed to releasing data two months after the period that the data covers. So what has happened to the March quarter? And the July quarter shouldn't be too far away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we know that if the figures were good they'd be out by now. In spite of the claims that there was money in the budget for packages, I wonder if they barely made a dent in the waiting list of more than 100,000 people. These are people who are eligible for an aged-care in-home package. They're meeting the requirements to be given that package. They're ready to accept that package, but they're still waiting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that being cared for in your home has huge benefits, and that is not only the cost. It costs somewhere between $100,000 and $120,000 of taxpayer money for people to be cared for in a facility. It is much, much cheaper to allow people to be cared for in their own homes. People can sleep in their own bed, they can have their own bedroom, surrounded by their own things. They can have their pet and they can turn the TV up as loud as they like. Care can be totally personalised, which is much harder to do in an aged-care facility. There's also that sense of independence, of having some control over many aspects of your daily life. You get to decide when to eat, when to sleep and when to socialise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government deserves condemnation for what it's doing to people like Anthea. I think it should apologise to Anthea, to her mum and to people like Noeleen O'Beirne whose husband, Patrick, didn't live long enough to see his level 4 package delivered. And she herself is no stranger to waiting. These people deserve the funding they've been assessed for, the funding that's been committed to them, and they absolutely deserve an apology from this government for what it's doing to them. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:00</span>):  This is a very important issue. The number of our senior Territorians is increasing. The number of senior Territorians in Darwin and Palmerston, in my electorate, continues to rise. That's why I rise to put on the record my support for the motion moved by the member for Franklin. Constituentsânot just senior Territoriansâtheir children, their friends and their grandchildren, Australians across the nation, are concerned about this issue. Their loved ones, their elders, are languishing in limbo waiting for approved home-care packages from this government, a government that seems to have different priorities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government's budget in relation to this issue was a cruel hoax. It was a cruel hoax for older Australians, with not a single extra cent for Australia's aged-care system in this year's budget. I know that members from regional areas in Australia will be getting the same feedback as I am. How on earth could a federal government have a tax policy that would give $17 billion for banks but cut the take-home pay of Australians? Pensioners, our seniors, get $14 a fortnight. More than that, how can the government allocate in their budgeting $17 billion for the banks but not put a single extra cent in Australia's aged-care system? That is unconscionable to me and, I think, to most reasonable Australians who respect their senior Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fine print of the budget has revealed trickery at the centre of its aged-care plan. It's slashing residential care and funding for nursing homes to try to fix the home-care crisis. The Prime Minister is simply giving with one hand and taking away with the other. What's worse, the government's con won't even come close to solving the crisis in home care. There are 100,000 senior Australiansâor, as we heard the member for Mayo quote the minister responsible, 102,000 older Australiansâstill waiting for care. The Turnbull government has locked in a big-bank tax handout of $17 billion. It must hurt, if you live in a community like mine, to be a member of the government benches and continue to hear that reality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This same government wants our tradies and nurses to work until they're 70. Forgive me for pointing out what's incredibly obvious, but this government is completely out of touch when it comes to senior Australians. I agree with the earlier speaker: this government needs to apologise for, once again, over-promising to senior Australians and then absolutely under-delivering. One constituent in my electorate, Rita Fisher, is currently on level 3 care. Rita has been approved for level 4 care but has been on the waiting list for two years, and counting. Rita has told me that she must pay out of her own pocket for level 4 servicesâthat she has been approved forâas she waits. So she is paying as she waits, even though she's been approved for those services. This is completely unacceptable. We heard just before from the member for Mayo that the minister responsible, the member for Hasluck, says that the government doesn't have the money to do more. So the obvious question is: why does the government have the funds to allocate to tax cuts for the big banks when it can't look after our senior Australians?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  I rise to condemn the Turnbull government for the crisis in home care which they have created by slashing funding for this very important service. These harsh cuts mean that older Australians often have to wait months and months to access desperately needed home-care packages. These packages provide vital assistance that enable our seniors to remain in their homes longer with effective support. There are currently more than 100,000 older Australians waiting for a home-care package for which they have already been approved. In my region, locals are constantly telling me they have to wait months and months to access these much needed packages, and they often just end up going without these services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this alarming figure, the Turnbull government continues with its inaction in the aged-care sector. It is truly extraordinary that, in the face of such a growing aged-care crisis, the government has failed to act. In an even crueller hoax, the Turnbull government has actually stripped funds from residential aged care in order to fund a very minimal number of aged-care packagesâonly 14,000 packages. That is a paltry number, considering the very dire need. These 14,000 new packages won't even come close to fixing the aged-care crisis. Taking money from one portion of the aged-care budget and then simply putting it in a different section doesn't actually address the problem. This reveals the dangerous and irrational approach this government has when it comes to the care of our older Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last six months of 2017, the waitlist for home-care packages grew by 20,000 people. The fact is: older Australians deserve better. They deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and they deserve to be able to access services when they need them. Margot, a constituent in my electorate, still lives in her home and quite rightly wants to remain in her home with home-care help. Margot turned 99 in June this year and she is totally blind. She is currently receiving a care package at level 2. This funding provides her with two carers for three hours each per week to assist with her shopping, house cleaning and personal care. This level is clearly insufficient for her needs. Approximately eight months ago, Margot was assessed by ACAT, the Aged Care Assessment Team, as level 4, and she was placed on high priority, and she is still waiting today. After repeated requests for her to access level 4, she's been advised she's still high priority on the waiting list, but it could be six to 12 months before she actually receives it. So here is a woman in her 100th year who is blind and finds it hard to walk, and she's just told to wait. This wait is unacceptable. This situation is unacceptable. I call on the minister and the Turnbull government to address this desperate situation immediately and deliver those level 4 home-care packages now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The crisis in home care shows how this government is out of touch and how fundamentally wrong all of their priorities actually are. Government is all about choices and priorities. In this instance, the Turnbull government has abandoned our older Australians and instead they've chosen to give the banks a $17 billion tax handout. They've put the banks above aged care. They've put the banks above health care. They've put the banks above our older Australians. In the regions, it's the National Party that puts the banks above local, regional and rural communities. How about this as a solution: instead of giving tax cuts to the banks, fund more home-care packagesâfairly straightforward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians know that the Turnbull government has abandoned so many people who have high aged-care needs. They can see that the government has left almost 300 older Australians on waiting lists for over two years. A further 636 older Australians have waited more than a year for care, and they currently have no care at all. There are thousands more getting less care than they actually need. As Ian Yates, the CEO of Council on the Ageing Australia, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's absolutely clear the Government will have to bite the bullet and put extra resources into home care.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I call on the government to act. Home-care packages make it easier for older Australians to remain in their homes and to keep living there. It's clear what needs to be done, and it's shameful this government has abandoned our older Australians. In fact, the Turnbull government should apologise to our older Australians and their concerned family and friends, and they should apologise to people like Margot for their failure to deliver much-needed home-care packages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side, the Labor Party condemns this failure on behalf of all Australians. We are committed to holding this government to account when it comes to providing aged-care services. We won't stop until there's real action taken on home care. We won't stop until there is more funding delivered so that our older Australians can get the care and full services that they deserve. So we say to the Turnbull government: no more cuts and no more excuses. It's now time for action. Fix the crisis in our aged-care sector.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="ECV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:10</span>):  I take the opportunity to thank the member for Bass for raising this very important matter for debate this evening. I join with my colleagues in condemning the government for the way that they've handled the aged-care crisis that has occurred under their watch. We'll not let the government fool everyday Australians into believing that they care about our elderly. Time and time again, the government has shown no willingness to work with this side of the House to put the interests of older Australians at the front and centre of the debate. In fact, they've done the exact opposite. This government has played a hoax on the Australian people. They pretended to allocate more funding to aged care, but the fact is not an extra dollar was allocated to the aged-care system in this year's budgetânot one extra dollar. How can the government find $80 billion of tax cuts for big business, including $17 billion for the big four banksâand the inquiry that's taking place at the moment is interestingâbut can't find one single extra dollar to put into care for our older Australians? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Keep in mind that on top of this the Abbott-Turnbull governments have previously cut aged care, robbing the industry of billions of dollars over the past five years. The Health Services Union appropriately summed up the ramifications of the government's persistent attack on the aged-care sector in their submission to the House Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport. They stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">What is undisputed among providers, unions, consumer advocacy groups and residents is that cuts to aged care funding by consecutive federal governments are having a significant and adverse impact upon the provision of quality care to older Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that in the build-up to the budget that the government's rhetoric around aged care certainly didn't match its final announcement. In the lead-up to the budget the government framed the message around aged care, particularly the support that will be given to older Australians choosing to stay in their own homes. In fact, in a doorstop only days before the Treasurer handed down the budget the Minister for Health said, 'It's going to be a very good budget for health and aged care in particular.' All they did in the budget was simply cut the money out of residential aged care to pay that money to home-care packages, therefore, there wasn't an extra dollar in it. In other words, Malcolm Turnbull was simply robbing Peter to pay Paul.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For what it's worth, the government won't even come close to resolving this aged-care crisis which has occurred under its watch. The funding is for just 14,000 new home-care packages over the next four years. That's nothing but a cruel hoax. The simple fact is, to put this in perspective, it's only 3,500 places a year. Frankly, that's not acceptable. It is insufficient to keep pace with current demand. We currently have more than 100,000 older Australians still waiting for approved home-care packages. What we know is that in the last six months of 2017 alone the waiting list for home care grew by a staggering 20,000 places. Once again this government has been caught overpromising and underdelivering for older Australians. The government's response to older Australians is an insult and does nothing to address the aged-care crisis which they have created. This has all occurred on their watch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that has a proven track record in cutting funding and underinvesting in aged care. It has not shown much compassion for older Australians. We have a government that expects Australians to work until they're 70 and to pay more for their energy by ripping off the energy supplement to two million Australiansâand that also includes 400,000 aged pensioners. We simply have a responsibility to ensure quality aged-care services and ensure that real and positive change occurs in this sector. If we can't positively resource the sector that looks after older Australians, Australians who have contributed so much to this country, then, collectively, we have failed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this note, I would call on the government to immediately address the home-care crisis. Our older Australians and their families cannot afford to wait any longer. This government must act and it must act now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:15</span>):  We are incredibly blessed in Australia to have such incredible natural beauty spread right across the country, from northern Western Australia to southern Western Australia, right around to southern South Australia and Tasmania. Here in the ACT we have the beautiful Brindabellas, and of course, there are the Alps and Kosciuszko. It is a country of great natural beauty, and the Great Barrier Reef is one of those standout elements of our nation and our environment here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For aeons, the First Australians have shared an intrinsic link with the land, its flora and its fauna. Today, we continue to share that connection with our natural environment. Every year, Australia's natural environment is shared with millions and millions of tourists. The Great Barrier Reef alone attracts two million visitors each year, supports 64,000 jobs and generates more than $6 billion in tourism each year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as supporting tens of thousands of jobs, the reef supports an incredibly rich and diverse ecosystem. Anyone who has had the privilege and honour of snorkelling or scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef will vouch for the fact that it is absolutely extraordinary. We are so blessed to have it in our nation; it is a wonderful natural environment. It is quite phenomenal when you do snorkel there, just seeing the diversity of the landscape that is under the seaâall the amazing fish and creatures, and this whole world that is just there, unseen by so many, unfortunately. And yet for those who do have the privilege, their eyes are just wide open about the wonder that is the world of the Great Barrier Reef.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, as we know, the Great Barrier Reef stretches 2,300 kilometres, and is the world's largest living structureâone of the seven natural wonders of the world. It has 600 types of soft and hard corals, more than 100 species of jellyfish, 3,000 varieties of molluscs, 500 species of worms, more than 1,500 types of fish and 133 varieties of sharks and rays, and more than 30 species of whales and dolphins call the Great Barrier Reef home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, this incredibly ecosystem and other marine environments around Australia are under threat. They're under threat from inaction by those opposite on climate change. We've heard about the bleaching of the corals and how it's getting worse and not better. It looked as if it were on hold for a while there, but it's getting worseâit's spreading. My great fear, as someone who has had the honour and privilege of being up at the Great Barrier Reef and seeing the diversity of the colour and the fish, is of going back there and comparing it to when I was there a few years agoâseeing the damage that has been wrought by climate change and by the bleaching of the corals, and also the diminution of the fish and other sea creatures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A joint budget submission from the World Wildlife Foundation and the Australian Conservation Foundation identified that $475 million a year will need to be invested in the reef on an ongoing basis in order to meet the water quality improvements promised to the international community. So, yes, the $500 million at the centre of this motion would normally be welcome. But, like so much of this government's inability to actually administer this country and effectively implement policy without one debacle after another, the $500 million that is mentioned in this motion is now the subject of controversy and under a cloud because of how the money was allocated by the Prime Minister and his minister. That is now the centre of attention. I bet that the member for Capricornia did not expect her congratulatory motion on the government's $500 million commitment for the Great Barrier Reef would turn a complete 180 degrees within the space of a couple of months. Again, this underscores the incompetence of this government when it comes to governing this country and when it comes to accountability, transparency and effective public administration. It's an absolute disgrace. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef is the planetâs greatest living wonder â¦</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This begs the question: why then are the member and her government determined to undermine and kill this great natural resource? The Turnbull government is responsible for the largest removal of heritage listings in the entire world, which is happening to our Great Barrier Reef. This government is responsible for removing and unwinding protections for the Great Barrier Reef, which is putting at risk more than 70,000 jobs and billions of dollars that flow into North Queensland's economy. Labor is the party that protects the reef and Labor will always be the party that fights for the reef.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of removing vital protections, the Turnbull government has also given almost half a billion dollars to an organisation without any tender process, without knowing how many staff work at the organisation and without the organisation even asking for the funds. In Senate estimates, the Department of the Environment and Energy could not explain how or why $444 million was being allocated to one organisation, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. The budget for the Great Barrier Reef Foundation will be increased by 45 times. Their revenue for 2015 and 2016 was $9.6 million and $8 million respectively. The foundation has only six full-time members and five part-time members. Its CEO described the grant as like 'winning the lotto'. Grant recipients should not describe receiving almost half a billion dollars of taxpayers' money as 'winning the lotto'. It begs the question: how will they manage such a huge influx in funding?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, the Turnbull government is proposing to give the funding in one payment. This brings a whole new meaning to 'fish out of water'. Granting $444 million in taxpayer dollars without a public grant process, an open and transparent process, a competitive process or consideration as to whether the authority could actually carry out this work just shows how arrogant and out of touch this government really is. I think everyone can agree that something certainly smells fishy. Instead of giving $444 million to one of Townsville's own local departmentsâsuch as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, CSIRO at James Cook University, AIMS or the environment departmentâthe government gave it to a small foundation, with absolutely no consultation. There was an opportunity to create much-needed jobs in Townsville, but, instead, Malcolm Turnbull has given the funds to his big business mates. Last week, on the ABC program <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> the Prime Minister was unable to point to any policy or probity behind his decision to award almost half a billion dollars of taxpayers' money to a foundation with six full-time staff. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Responsibility for this cash splash lies squarely with the Prime Minister. It has been a careless use of taxpayers' money. There are massive holes in the contract and secrecy provisions that are in perpetuity. The government has already transferred all of the $444 million to the foundation, and the public funds are now sitting in term deposits in banks associated with the foundation. Will we ever know how some of that money is spent? The members who run the private foundation include executives from the major banks and mining companies, which means that the CSIRO and GBRMPA will need permission from the banks and miners to seek extra funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The future of the reef should not be determined behind closed doors by the Prime Minister's big business mates. That is why Labor has called on the federal government to renege on the $440 million grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. Labor launched a petition calling on the Prime Minister to secure the return of the $444 million of public money he gifted to this small private organisation. I encourage everyone to go to Labor's website and sign the petition. I want to see a transparent and accountable process implemented in order to protect the Great Barrier Reef. This is about protecting one of the greatest natural wonders of the world and, more importantly, the 70,000 jobs that rely on it, many of which come into North Queensland and my electorate of Herbert.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate on university funding. It is a very important debate that illuminates a fundamental contrast between the government's narrow vision for Australia and our future and that of the opposition, the Labor Party. Education is a key fault line in Australian politics at the moment at every level. This motion moved by the member for Griffith highlights the failings of the government when it comes to higher education, in particular the university sector. The government has made cuts that are not only short-sighted but cruel, and that will have an extraordinary impact not only at the individual level, on many young Australians, particularly those who have not had every advantage in life, but also on our collective wellbeing and our path to secure prosperity as a nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion highlights as well some of the failures of the government's political management. We remember the member for Sturt, the predecessor of the current Minister for Education, who liked to describe himself as a fixer on matters of policy and politics. When it comes to his record in the education portfolio there is a bitter irony attached to his boast. The current minister, Senator Birmingham, also carries on that attitude of being a fixer, but when we examine his record we see it looks very thin. Nothing has been fixed. When it comes to early years we are now seeing the impact of his so-called fix, with many families being pushed out of early learning, many kids denied the opportunity of access to high-quality early learning and the foundation for their school education and their journey through life. This is in defiance of the evidence and any principles of equity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all remember their triumph of just over a year ago and the false bravado of Minister Birmingham and of the government as a whole. They boasted that they had ended the schools funding wars. How does their boast look now? The government spoke of having ended Labor's 'special deals'. They are now flailing around whilst being internally divided, trying to stitch together deals to salvage their position. It is an extraordinary thing that Minister Birmingham has done in schools policy: he has offended every sector in the education system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we move on to universities. There is no fix here, because there is really no policy from the government. There is no meaningful policy after five years. That is in contrast to Labor's record of increasing investment in our universities and of recognising their critical role as an enabler of individual attainment of potential, of individual fulfilment in life, and as a driver of the sort of country we want to be, a country where we harness our greatest natural advantageâthe talents of young and older Australiansâto its fullest potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is in denial about that role of universities and about their critical role when it comes to research, supporting Australian businesses and investment more generally. We have seen more than $2 billion in cuts to universities. This is denying thousands of young Australians a place at university. It is impacting on the experiences of those currently at university. Over the break, I had the opportunity to speak with university students at the University of Melbourne and La Trobe University. The uncertainty that they face and feel for themselves and, indeed, for their younger brothers and sisters is palpable. It is a constraint on their opportunities and, again, on all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have this government here which once boasted, when the now Prime Minister took office, of agility and innovation. Yet its every action is to reverse of that. It is denying us the capacity to fulfil our potential by denying too many young Australians of their capacity to reach their potential. The government needs to understand the challenges of the workforce of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have just been involved in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on a significant bit of work around the transition from school. To make real the recommendations of that report, bipartisan recommendations, we need to do two things. We need to invest properly in our schools, but we also need to properly fund our universities and wrap that funding in a vision of a sustainable policy framework that looks to the first principles of our universitiesâtheir necessary role in enabling the higher education of talented young Australians, whatever their background, and their role as a driver of the research that is so critical to the future of the Australian economy. The government stands condemned for its neglect of Australia's universities and the cruel impact this has had and will continue to have. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  I'm grateful to the member for Griffith for proposing this motion as it gives us another opportunity to show up Labor's dishonesty and remind the people of Australia of the truth about university funding in Fisher and, indeed, all over the country. When I was at university, I studied law, and one of the things I learnt is how important it is to understand the words you are using and to use them with care. It's particularly important in our work here making the laws that govern Australians. A party that doesn't use words carefully is a party that doesn't deserve the people's trust.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members opposite talk about cuts. They use the word 'cut's a lot. They throw it around. In fact, we have seen recently that repeating the word 'cuts' again and again is really all they have. Yet they seem, at best, to have no idea what that word means. This motion, and the whole of Labor's argument on education and health, is false, empty, meaningless, because it relies on a totally dishonest representation of this government's policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me offer members opposite some help. A quick look at a dictionary tells us that 'to cut' means 'to lower, reduce, diminish or curtail'. Perhaps they can begin to see how wrong they have beenâbecause the Turnbull government is not lowering university funding; it is, in fact, raising it. We are not reducing university funding, but increasing it. We are not diminishing or curtailing or lessening or decreasing university funding. We are growing it by 23 per cent over the next four years. An increase of billions of dollars is not a cut, not by anyone's honest definition, and the Australian people know it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government is growing federal funding to universities to a record $17 billion this year. We will spend more on universities in each of the next four years than any federal government before, but we will contain that growth to responsible levels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate of Fisher, we have a fantastic regional universityâthe University of the Sunshine Coast. The USC is a dynamic, growing institution under the exceptional leadership of Vice-Chancellor Professor Greg Hill. I'm passionate about making the Sunshine Coast the place to be for education, and I've advocated strongly on behalf of USC in Canberra. I've worked closely with them since my election on projects like the federally funded Mind and Neuroscience Thompson Institute and on my Fisher defence industry initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through its rapid growth and it's well-earned success, USC has had the third largest increase in base funding for Commonwealth supported places of any university in the country since 2009. This funding continues to grow. Last year, funding for teaching and learning came to $165 million. This year it is $172 million, and it will keep growing to $182.8 million in 2021. This substantial federal support helped USC to a net operating result of $28.8 million in 2016 and to cash and investments of $79.9 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Vice-Chancellor Hill's leadership, USC is continuing to grow, with new campuses in Moreton Bay and Fraser Coast in Hervey Bay. For the new Moreton Bay campus, which I was delighted to be part of launching earlier this year, funding will increase by $69.4 million. Next year, this campus will get $7.5 million more. In 2020-21 it will receive $22.9 million in extra funding and in 2021-22 it will see an extra $39 million. We will also increase the number of Commonwealth supported places available to USC to fill that campus with new Australian students. USC's Moreton Bay campus will have 1,200 places in 2020, 2,400 places in 2021 and 3,600 places in 2022. We are further supporting this campus with a $35 million grant to the Moreton Bay Regional Council to build infrastructure.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms TEMPLEMAN:</span>
                  </a>  Just before Christmas, the Turnbull government decided to freeze growth in university places as part of a fourth attempt at university cuts. At Western Sydney University, which many of my constituents attend, they're facing some of the largest hits to any university in New South Wales. Of the more than $2.2 billion being denied to universities across Australia, $93 million will not go to Western Sydney University. About a quarter of the students come from low-income families, and nearly 62 per cent of students at Western Sydney University are the first in their family to go to uni.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By slashing their funding, the government has effectively reintroduced limits on student numbers. There was no consultation and no discussion, just a big fat roadblock to someone's education. It takes us back to the bad old days when undergraduate places were determined by bureaucrats in Canberra. That led to a university system that wasn't keeping up with population growth or the needs of a growing economy. I remember when entry scores for courses were becoming high because supply was being deliberately held tight at a time of increasing demand. 'How dare people assume that they should be entitled to do go to universities!' seemed to be the prevailing idea. The reality of John Howard's university system was that many bright students were missing out on the course that they wanted, while others, who had wealthy parents, could buy their way into a course with a lower entry score by paying full fees. We can't go back to that. That skewed universities in favour of those from the most privileged backgrounds, while there was a lack of participation from students from outer metropolitan areas like mine. That's why Labor set about boosting participation in higher education, particularly the number of students from regional Australia and disadvantaged and unrepresented backgrounds. As a result, 190,000 more Australians have attended university, many coming from areas where participation was lower.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The university system should be driven by demand. It seems those opposite want to make it harder to go to uni, but we don't. Dr Andy Marks, who's the Assistant Vice-Chancellor of Western Sydney University, rightly asks:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">How will freezing university enrolments in Western Sydney bring about the monumental skills-uplift required in the region's labour force? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">How will demanding nurses, teachers and social workers pay more of their HECS debt sooner help deliver the frontline services the region so desperately needs? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are good questions and issues to raise. The consequences of the cuts are that students will be worse off, there will be fewer staff employed, scholarships will be at risk and some of the schemes that support not just students but the wider community will have to go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, not all the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury based students go to Western Sydney University; many travel further afield to the University of Sydney, the University of New South Wales, Macquarie University, UTS and the University of Wollongong. That doesn't mean they're immune from these cuts. These cuts total $330 million over four years to those other New South Wales institutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, many year-12 students are sitting their trial HSC in preparation for their main exams in October. Many of them have the added stress of making a decision about whether they go to university, which university to apply for and even whether or not they can really afford it. The students travelling from outer metropolitan areas, if they're lucky enough to get a place, will join the rest of Western Sydney in contending with the failing train system, hefty road tolls and long travel times, even if they're heading to a local campus. Others will opt for crazy rents and two-minute noodles in preference. Many will try and pay their way through uni on a wage that is less likely than ever to cover the cost of living, made worse by this government's attack on penalty rates. No matter which way you look at it, cutting funding to universities, especially those that impact Western Sydney, is yet another attack that will increase inequality. A Centre for Western Sydney report released last year shows bachelor degree attainment among young people in the region is 40 per cent lower than elsewhere. I'll quote Dr Marks again:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The government's freeze on funding shows they are OK with that imbalance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I see a problem. That imbalance is not okay with me. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:55</span>):  I'm delighted to speak on this motion, which gives me an opportunity to highlight the deception that typifies the Shorten Labor Party. As we know, from its conception the Labor Party has been guided by a range of philosophersâfrom Marx to Engels and even Mark Latham. In more recent times, we know those opposite have been inspired by Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders. But, over the recess, I think I found their true guiding philosopher: Seinfeld's George Costanza. In fact, I've begun to wonder whether George Costanza's favourite maxim, 'It's not a lie if you believe it', was at some point surreptitiously inserted into the Labor Party's constitution. This Costanza-ite motion follows in the tradition of 'Mediscare' and 'Operation Tell Mistruths about Caboolture Hospital'. It's yet another embarrassing attempt to trick the voting public. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor seem to have conveniently forgotten their own party's record on higher education when they were in government. I encourage those opposite to reflect on the $6.6 billion in higher education and research cuts that Labor announced during its last three years in government, including $2.9 billion in its last budget in 2013-14. Yet in opposition Labor has opposed an efficiency dividend that it recommended while it was in government. University students and their families should know that Commonwealth university funding is not reducing, it's indeed growing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that the Turnbull government is providing a record total of $17 billion per annum of investment in higher education. No-one is missing out on a university place this year or next year as a result of government policy. It is and remains, as it should, the universities' exclusive prerogative to enrol as many students as they wish. Universities receive the index student contribution from the Commonwealth for however many students they enrol. Funding of bachelor places is maintained at 2017 levels over the next two years. This doesn't affect how many students a university chooses to enrol. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The advantage of the demand driven funding model is that universities can choose which students they wish to enrol and how many students they will take. The Commonwealth provides funding on a per student basisâso the more students the more funding. The rate of funding per student has stayed the same. There is no cut. The reality is that, in the university sector, we want universities to be spending taxpayer money much more wisely than they're doing. There is a degree of fat in universities and we want to see more taxpayer money spent on academicsâteaching and researchâand less on back-office administrators. At the same time that Commonwealth funding per student has grown by 15 per cent, the costs for universities to deliver courses has only increased by 9Â½ per cent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Independent analysis from Deloitte has shown that universities divert 15 per cent of taxpayer funding towards endeavours other than student and course related expenses, such as administration and marketing. We want to see more taxpayer money spent on teaching and research. The growth of funding that the Commonwealth has given to the university sector has outstripped the growth in the entire economy. Indeed, it's growing at twice the rate of the economy, and that just isn't sustainable. The truth is that Labor have had many opportunities to keep university funding on a sustainable basis but they would rather outdo the Greens on economic irresponsibility than fix the funding problems they created. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a long-term solution and that's why, under the Turnbull government's policy, from 2020 the growth of university funding will be based on population increases and will be subject to meeting performance measures. The old funding model was inefficient, wasting taxpayers' money, and, in the long run, it was completely unsustainable. Our policy solves both of these problems. We're providing sustainable funding growth and making universities accountable. It's a responsible policy that addresses inefficient, unsustainable spending and ensures that future generations will get the most out of their university experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By linking funding with performance outcomes, we're incentivising universities to focus their attention on improving academic performance, student retention and employability. The Turnbull government is ensuring new students are going into a system that wants to produce successful and employable graduates. The demand driven system provides more students with the opportunity to attend university and puts those students in the best position to meet the needs of an emerging economy. It also lets universities select the students they want, rather than have a Canberra bean counter determine how many students a university can enrol. The Turnbull government supports the demand driven system. Labor says they support it, but they've continually voted down any opportunity to make that system sustainable. The enduring legacy of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years was economic vandalism. Motions like this one show that Labor has learnt nothing from its failures in government and, given the opportunity, they'd thrown us straight back in the same mess. Labor will never face up to the fact we have to live within our means. I value the university experience. Education is the bedrock on which the whole economy exists. That's why I'm proud to be part of a government that's increasing funding for universities and equally proud that we're ensuring that the rate of this increase is sustainable for future generations.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  Australia's education system is world leading. It supports more than one million students, both international and domestic, and our universities directly employ 120,000 people and support another 40,000 jobs. It must be protected. I'm proud to speak on this motion today and stand up for not only university students and future university students in my electorate but for students rights across this country who have been left short-changed by this government. Make no mistake, this government has taken a wrecking ball to our universities and higher education system, with $2.2 billion cuts since they have come to powerâa simply staggering number that means our universities will be under-resourced and our students will miss out on the vital education they need to succeed in the fast-moving 21st century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor was last in office we lifted the caps on the high number of uni places, which saw, in my community in Oxley, a huge increase in the number of students attending university. We've seen the complete opposite by this government. Their $2.2 billion axe to our universities means that 9Â½ thousand Australians missed out on a university place in 2018 and another 9Â½ thousand will miss out on a place in 2019. This is just unacceptable. We must be supporting and investing in our universities rather than gutting the institutions that will guide the next generation of scientists, doctors and teachers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's future economy will require a highly skilled workforce. This government's cuts to our universities do nothing to support that. The government is going out of its way and making deals with One Nation to prove that point. Earlier this year we saw the government make a deal with One Nationâa deal to deliver tax cuts for the big end of town in exchange for a mere 1,000 apprenticeships, which is nothing more than a pathetic con job. In particular, it is selling out young Australians. We know that, since this government came to power, Australia has lost over 140,000 apprenticeships, a decline of over 35 per cent. In my community we have seen a loss of around 1,500 apprenticeships, which is equivalent to a 43 per cent decrease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just students looking to go to university who are in the sights of this government but any person wishing to finish their education will pay the price. I know in my own community there are many current high school students who are aiming to be the first in their family to ever go to uni. Many of these students come from tough, disadvantaged backgrounds and are studying and working hard to see their dream of going to uni become a reality. But now, thanks to the Turnbull government, the door to a higher education is being slammed in their face by these vicious cuts to our universities. This is an especially cruel blow to the many year 12 graduates who have studied so hard to get into uni. There are reports of some universities already turning away students and cutting programs before next year begins.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's what it means for universities in Queensland in my home state: the University of Southern Queensland, with a campus in my electorate, is facing $36 million in cuts; Griffith University, a cut of $92 million; QUT, a cut of $100 million and the University of Queensland $100 million in cuts. Ironclad evidence that this government does not care about students in the country going to university and receiving a higher education. We know this because they have a track record of tearing down our universities. In fact, they have repeatedly attacked higher education year after year. When they were first elected it was a 20 per cent cut and full fee deregulation, which we know would have seen $100,000 degrees. Fortunately, my Labor colleagues and I were able to stop that, but they weren't done. In the next iteration, last year, they wanted to hike up fees by 7.5 per cent, have a commensurate cut in university funding, have a further cut to university funding and then cut the HECS payment threshold down to as low as $42,000âthat's barely more than the minimum wage and would mean Australians with a HELP debt on low incomes would be required to make repayments. I have to wonder if those opposite are actually aware of where Australia sits in the public investment in universities in the OECD. Are we near the top? Not even close. About midrange? No. Australia has the second-lowest level of public investment in universities in the OECD, and this government only wants to make it worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is an alternative. A Shorten Labor government, which invests in a higher education system and which believes in students, will have a once-in-a-generation national inquiry which will look at every aspect of our vocational and higher education systems. This will be the first time a national inquiry has put TAFE and unis on an equal footing. It's about ensuring that Australians have access to the best post-secondary opportunities in the world. If Australia is to continue to be a wealthy, highly educated nation, we must participate in quality education. I call on the government tonight to abandon their cuts to universities and instead to invest in Australia's future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245392" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  I want to acknowledge the hard work of the member for Griffith, Terri Butler, who joined me in Darwin just a little while ago and who has been a champion in the fight against the government's cuts to regional universities, including ours in Darwin, the Charles Darwin University. The member for Oxley, the previous member, rattled off about four or five universities. We understand that there are many universities in the larger capital cities of our nation, but for our northern capital there is oneâCharles Darwin University. I guess that for this side, universities are not just research centres and places of teaching but part of the foundation on which we want to build a better nation. That's certainly true for us in the Territory. Charles Darwin University, our university, is so important for building the foundations on which we're going to build a better Territory. Education is one of the keys to preparing our society, especially our kids, to understand, anticipate and shape change, not just react to it. We want to build a northern future that really grasps the potential of the north and the massive markets further north.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the current federal government, under Prime Minister Turnbull, has cut $30 million from our university, which represents a decline of 8.1 per cent in funding. Unfortunately, regional universities are disproportionally affected by the government's decision to cut higher education. We might ask where their priorities might be: if regional universities are missing out, who might not be missing out? Of course, the $17 billion handout to the big banks becomes unconscionable. If they're serious about developing the north and developing the human capacity of Australians then why would they cut funding to universities, particularly to ours?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">CDU is ranked in the top two per cent of universities in the world. CDU makes a range of social and economic contributions to the Northern Territory. These things are sometimes hard to quantify, but there are things like improved opportunity for social mobility and cohesion across the north. As all members should know, these cuts place our university's future in jeopardy, which makes no sense. Darwin is on Asia's doorstep and Asia is increasingly hungry for the quality educational opportunities we provide. It should be our No. 1 export. CDU offers a unique chance to study in one of the world's most diverse and spectacular natural and cultural environments, and for many in the tropics to our north, where there are billions of people living, it has a tropical environment where they would feel very much at home when studying with us. Today over 1,500 international students from 50 countries call CDU campuses home. This, obviously, presents huge opportunities for CDU and other regional universities to service the growing education demandâas I said, from Asia in particular. We should be investing heavily in the human and capital infrastructure across our education system to realise this massive opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without a viable, active university, our young people often seek to go elsewhere for their education. They'll increasingly do this if CDU isn't properly funded. As a smaller university, like other regional universities, CDU doesn't have the financial depth, flexibility and contacts with the same level of philanthropy as do some of the big sandstones we see in the southern capitals. So we are, without a doubt, disadvantaged in this regard. We've also got a small population size. Many people want to study part time and move in and out of education. This model that CDU uses is a high-cost delivery model, so it makes it challenging financially. So, in case you haven't picked it up yet, we can do without $30 million in cuts to our CDU.</span>

Prior to the ceremony attendees are registered by ceremony organisers. Following the ceremony, the presiding officer must sign the pledge verification list, confirming that each person on the list has attended the ceremony and made the pledge of commitment. The names of people who failed to attend the ceremony or make the pledge are deleted by the presiding officer ruling through their names on the list. The list is then returned to the Department so that people who attended and made the pledge can be registered as citizens.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr Tehan:</span>
                  </a>  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) does not currently have nominated timeframes between plan submission for approval and plan approval, and between plan approval and implementation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On 15 May 2018, the Commonwealth Ombudsman publically released a report into the NDIA's administration of reviews. The report included recommendations to establish KPIs or agreed service standards for completion of unscheduled plan reviews and internal reviews. The NDIA accepts all of the Ombudsman's recommendations and has commenced the implementation of the report's recommendations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) A new planning approach is being piloted in Victoria as part of the new participant pathway. This includes a joint planning meeting (aka 'side-by-side' planning) between the participant, their Local Area Coordinator and an NDIA planner. During this meeting, the participant is fully engaged in the development of their plan and can ask questions and make minor amendments before their plan is finalised. The NDIA will progressively roll out key features of the new pathway which have been piloted from mid-2018. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) The NDIA has received a higher than expected number of requests for participant initiated plan reviews under the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 </span>(NDIS Act) â both Section 100 Reviews (Review of a Reviewable Decision) and Section 48 Reviews (Plan Review due to a Change of Circumstances). The high volume of review requests has resulted in an increased wait time for NDIS participants. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) Work has commenced on a number of strategies and initiatives to improve the administration of reviews in the NDIA. These strategies include:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">a) reviewing and re-designing end-to-end processes and supporting guidance for requesting and completing reviews;</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">b) reviewing practice guides and developing scripts and talking points for front-of-house, business support officers, the Centralised Regional Response Team (CRRT) and National Contact Centre (NCC) staff to help participants understand the review process and pathway;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">c) developing and implementing processes for contacting participants who have a pending request and informing them of the process moving forward;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">d) formalising a triage approach to prioritise urgent cases;</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">e) identifying the drivers contributing to the higher than expected level of requests that can then be addressed. A Business Improvement Team has been established to implement system and practice changes to this effect; </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">f) establishing the Assistive Technology and Home Modification Redesign Project, as well as interim improvements to existing processes â it is recognised that requests relating to assistive technology and home modification drive a notable portion of review requests; and </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">g) building on planned improvements to the NDIS business system.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) All internal reviews of a decision are conducted by a staff member who was not involved in the original decision. If the participant is dissatisfied with the internal review of the decision, they can apply for an external review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(6) NDIA plan delegates consider a participant's individual support needs, informal, community and mainstream supports available as part of a planning conversation and apply the NDIS Act and Rules when determining what 'reasonable and necessary' supports will be included in the participant's NDIS plan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">NDIS Operational Guidelines provide additional information regarding planning and specific supports to assist the plan approver in their decision making. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(7) 'Reasonable and necessary' supports are governed by the NDIS Act (section 34 1. (a) â (f), 34. 2) and the NDIS (Supports for Participants) Rules. The NDIA delegate (approver) must be satisfied that all of the section 34 1. (a) â (f) criteria are met before supports are funded or provided by the NDIS. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(8) Each NDIS participant will have their own plan goals, personal circumstances and disability support needs. While some participants may appear to have similar support needs, their individual situation may indicate different support responses to meet their needs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(9) Transport may not be considered a reasonable and necessary support if a participant can use public transport without substantial difficulty due to their disability. Some participants may receive funded supports to improve their community access and transport performances such as training supports to develop their skills to use public transport, or vehicle modifications to travel or drive a private vehicle. The day-to-day cost that any Australian would incur for their personal travel needs such as public transport fares or vehicle ownership, would not be considered a reasonable and necessary support </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Respite may not be considered a reasonable and necessary support if this support did not account for what is reasonable to expect families to provide, particularly with regard to the provision of care and support for participants who are children; or when a participant can be supported to improve their ability to do things for themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(10) The cost associated with an internet service is considered a day-to-day living cost that anyone with this type of service would be required to pay. For some day-to-day living costs, there may be additional costs due to a participant's disability. For this to be considered a reasonable and necessary support, the NDIS would require evidence that this additional cost is solely and directly as a result of their disability support needs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(11) Participants select the provider of Support Coordination from those that are available in their location. Support coordination providers are expected to only accept the request if they have capacity to support participants within two working days of receiving the request for service. Support providers are encouraged to decline the request and advise the participant and the NDIA region if they do not have capacity at this moment in time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(12) The participant pathway outlines the information gathering process to ensure that the worker understands the participant's needs. The time spent with the participant can vary according to the needs of the participant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(13) The current targets governing the number of people NDIS workers transition to the NDIS is considered in the resourcing allocation while recognising that the time spent with a participant can vary. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(14) See (2).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(15) As the NDIS continues to transition across Australia, there will be a requirement to increase staffing levels in some regional centres. The increase in staffing, and the recruitment associated with it, will be in line with participant phasing as set out in the bilateral agreements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(16) Position descriptions contain a generic skillset the NDIA seeks when recruiting, however, there is no specific qualification or prior experience the NDIA requires when recruiting planners. Most of the planners have worked in the disability sector in jurisdictions. </span>

                <span style="font-weight:bold;">Mr Fletcher</span> â The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(1) (a) The MBSP's purpose and objectives are "to extend mobile phone coverage and competition" (see paragraph 1.1.2 of the round 1 Program Guidelines, paragraph 1.1.1 of the Round 2 Program Guidelines and paragraph 1.1.1 of the Priority Locations Round Guidelines).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(1) (b) The processes for awarding funding under the program, including the selection process and assessment criteria, are set out in the Program Guidelines for each round of the program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As outlined in the Program Guidelines, all three rounds of the program used competitive assessment processes to award funding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under these processes, mobile network operators (the operators) and mobile network infrastructure providers (providers) were asked to come forward with proposals to build new or upgraded mobile base stations to deliver improved mobile coverage to identified black spots.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under rounds 1 and 2, the operators were required to propose base station locations that would deliver improved mobile coverage to one or more of the locations on the database of black spots reported by members of the public. These proposals were assessed and ranked on a base-station-byÂ­ base-station basis according to the assessment criteria outlined in the Program Guidelines. These criteria included the expected benefits that each base station would deliver, such as the amount of new coverage (by square kilometre), the number of premises and the length of major transport routes to receive new mobile coverage.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consideration was also given to the total cost of the base station. This included the amount of funding the provider was contributing and any co-contribution the provider had secured from a third party such as state or local government. Commonwealth funding per base station was nominally capped at $500,000. The Department of Communications and the Arts was able to recommend a base station for funding which exceeded the cap, so long as it offered value for money to the Commonwealth.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Priority Locations round, the operators were asked to submit proposals to provide improved coverage at pre-announced priority locations. Proposed base stations were then individually assessed and ranked. The assessment process used a cost/coverage formula as specified in the Program Guidelines. Other factors, including coverage to premises and transport routes, were also considered as part of a value for money assessment for each proposed base station.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Each location recommended for funding was assessed as providing value for money to the Commonwealth.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(2) The funding recipients are required to meet specific performance metrics for each base station as set out in their respective funding agreements, including expected performance metrics for new handheld coverage, new external antenna coverage, number of premises to receive coverage and coverage to major transport routes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The funding recipients are required to report on these metrics for each base station once the base station is activated. The Commonwealth is not required to pay for base stations that do not meet their performance requirements unless changes to the performance metrics were approved by the Commonwealth prior to the construction of a base station. The Commonwealth will only agree to changes to performance metrics in exceptional circumstances where all other options have been exhausted, and only if the changes to performance metrics still represent overall value for money.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To date, one completed base station did not meet the agreed performance requirements. In this case it was not technically possible for the funding recipient to resolve the shortfall in performance through any modification to site specifications (e.g. change in location, increase in tower height, etc). While the base station still provided benefit to the community, a reduced Commonwealth payment for this base station was made reflecting the performance difference and to ensure it still represented value for money.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(3) As a measure of population density, under rounds 1 and 2 the Department of Communications and the Arts considered premises covered during the assessment process. Other benefits offered by a proposed base station were also considered in the assessment, such as the provision of handheld coverage, external antenna coverage and coverage to major transport routes. These benefits were considered for each proposed base station in order to assess the overall benefit to the community and to inform the overall value for money of the base station to the Commonwealth.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Priority Locations round, proposed base stations were assessed using a cost over coverage formula. A value for money assessment was also applied which considered the amount of premises to receive mobile coverage from the proposed base station.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, the mobile network operators have a commercial incentive to increase population coverage to the maximum extent possible. This drives providers to obtain the best coverage outcomes possible from every location.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(4) The geographical location and local topography influences both the cost and the commercial viability of a base station. For example, hilly topography can severely limit the amount of coverage achieved by a base station and can also result in higher deployment costs. Additionally, more remote base stations are typically more expensive to deploy and are often in lower populated areas, affecting their commercial viability.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The cost of a base station can also be dramatically affected by a small movement in location. For example, moving a base station a small distance to a higher location can add considerable cost if new road works are required or power and backhaul infrastructure needs to be further extended.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Program Guidelines for rounds 1 and 2 included equitable distribution principles that sought to share the benefits of the program nationally to the best extent possible. These principles included recommending at least ten base stations for funding in each of the states and five in the Northern Territory, and recommending at least one base station for funding in each electorate which had less than 50 per cent of the electorate area as a pat1 of a Major Urban Centre. However, base stations were still required to provide tangible benefits to the community and value for money to the Commonwealth.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further , under the round 2 assessment process, proposed base stations were awarded points if they were in remote or very remote areas of Australia, to encourage proposals in these typically higher cost areas. Round 2 also ensured that at least $10 million of funding was recommended for base stations in remote and very remote areas.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Under rounds 1 and 2, the Department of Communications and the Arts wrote to local councils to seek their support and to ask local councils to consider any cash or in-kind co-contributions they may be in a position to make towards the proposed base stations in their area. Under the Priority Locations round, local councils were contacted by either the Minister for Communications or the Minister for Regional Communications seeking the same type of information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The applicants applying for funding under the competitive assessment process were strongly encouraged to consult with local councils when developing their proposals . The applicants were also provided with contact information for councils.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The state governments also engaged directly with the applicants during the application process, including choosing to contribute to sites which addressed their specific community requirements.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Funding recipients are also required to consult with the community as part of standard planning approval processes. In some instances the exact location of a base station may be revised in response to state or local planning considerations and community concerns, including taking into account any impact on visual amenity . For example, a MBSP funded base station was moved a small distance to better locate it within a paddock to reduce the impact on the farming land.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As appropriate, the Department of Communications and the Arts engages with the funding recipient, the complainant and other relevant stakeholders to investigate issues raised. This may include seeking additional information from the complainant and in some cases asking the funding recipient to undertake coverage or cost modelling for specific proposals. The funding recipient may also be asked to directly engage with the complainant on the issue or to discuss a proposal.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A key consideration is to ensure a funded base station delivers the agreed coverage outcomes to the black spot area. In many cases, proposals that seek to move a base station from its original location would result in a substantial reduction in coverage for one part of a community (and the identified black spot) for the benefit of the proposing party. These proposals often result in substantial cost increases and in some cases are also technically infeasible.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr Littleproud:</span>
                  </a>  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">1. No â formal reconsideration under Division 4 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994</span> has not occurred, as risks have not been identified that require such reconsideration. The APVMA routinely evaluates all new, relevant data, reviews, and evaluations by peer-reviewed published researchers, comparable overseas and international regulatory bodies, relating to all active constituents including pyriproxyfen. The APVMA will re-evaluate the Australian health based guidance values and approved uses at a later date if evidence indicates that such action is needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Pyriproxyfen has been repeatedly evaluated by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The <span style="font-style:italic;">WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme</span> re-confirmed pyriproxyfen's pre-qualification status (including use drinking water sources) for control of disease carrying mosquitos and other disease vectors on 28 July 2017.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">2. Yes. All of the recent evidence supports the current Australian health based guidance values for pyriproxyfen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">3. The APVMA has not undertaken modelling and â based on an evaluation of the most recent published data on this topic â concluded that no further modelling is required at this time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">4. There is no evidence of such effects due to pyriproxyfen exposure in mammals or humans exposed up to at the existing health based guidance values. The current evidence supports the established Australian health based guidance values.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">5. Pyriproxyfen is approved for use in potable water in a number of countries including Australia, Singapore and Brazil. The <span style="font-style:italic;">WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme</span> re-confirmed pyriproxyfen's pre-qualification status (including use drinking water sources) for control of disease carrying mosquitos and other disease vectors on 28 July 2017. Furthermore, the <span style="font-style:italic;">WHO/London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Malaria Consortium</span> has recommended the use of pyriproxyfen in drinking water for the control of dengue virus transmission by mosquitos.</span>
