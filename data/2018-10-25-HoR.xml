                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test) Bill 2018 strengthens the current legislative framework in relation to visa refusals and cancellations on character grounds. This bill ensures that noncitizens who have been convicted of serious offences and who pose a risk to the safety of the Australian community are appropriately considered for visa refusal or cancellation. The bill presents a clear message to all noncitizens that the Australian community has no tolerance for foreign nationals who have been convicted of such crimes. This bill is in line with community expectations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is an accessible and attractive destination to visit, to do business and to live. We are a welcoming, multicultural, open and cohesive society. At the same time, we need to always ensure that we remain safe and secure. The government will not tolerate criminal behaviour of noncitizens. Entry and stay in Australia by noncitizens is a privilege, not a right, and the Australian community expects that the Australian government can and should refuse entry to noncitizens, or cancel their visas, if they do not abide by the rule of law. Those who choose to break the law and fail to uphold the standards of behaviour expected by the Australian community should expect to lose that privilege.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following 115 public submissions, the Joint Standing Committee on Migration's report on migrant settlement outcomes, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">No one teaches you to become an Australian</span>, noted that strengthening the character provisions will make Australians feel safe and be safer. Currently, a noncitizen would need to be sentenced to a minimum of 12 months in order for mandatory cancellation or refusal of their visa. However, this threshold is not capturing all those found guilty of serious criminality, including those who may not serve any custodial sentence and who may pose a continued risk to the safety of the community. This bill proposes that noncitizens who have been convicted of certain designated crimes be considered for discretionary cancellation or refusal regardless of the custodial sentence imposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Strengthening the character test in this way provides a clear and objective ground for which to consider the cancelling the visa of or refusing to grant a visa to a noncitizen who has been convicted of offences that involve violence against a person, including murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, assault, aggravated burglary and the threat of violence, nonconsensual conduct of a sexual nature, using or possessing a weapon or breaching an order made by a court or tribunal for the personal protection of another person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that the amendments provide for a discretionary power only. It allows consideration of cancellation or refusal of a visa if a person is convicted of a designated offence. In making a decision to refuse or cancel a visa on this ground, a wide range of factors contained within a binding ministerial direction will need to be taken into account, including the protection of the Australian community from criminal or other serious conduct, the best interests of minors in Australia, the expectations of the Australian community, Australia's international obligations, the impact on victims and the nature and extent of the person's ties to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill sends a clear and unequivocal message on behalf of the Australian community that entry or stay in Australia is a privilege granted only to those of good character. Like the Australian community, the government has no tolerance for noncitizens who are found to have committed these serious crimes. We make no apologies for protecting the Australian community and will ensure our migration program is one of integrity and available only to those who will make a positive temporary or permanent contribution to our nation. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

Port facilities on Christmas Island support the social and economic wellbeing of the community and support Australia's strategic interests in the Indian Ocean region.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2018-19 budget measure 'Indian Ocean Territoriesâessential infrastructure and air services', the government provided $51.6 million over four years, from 2018-18, to upgrade Commonwealth infrastructure and underwrite essential air services in the Indian Ocean Territories. The measure included $26.2 million over three years, from 2018-19, in capital funding for the project on Christmas Island. This includes the construction costs, the management and design fees, locality allowance and contingencies and escalation allowance. Net operating costs arising after completion of the project are expected to decrease due to the new infrastructure and the removal of the redundant and inoperable infrastructure. Subject to parliamentary approval of the proposed work, construction is planned to commence in mid-April 2019, with staged completion of facilities between mid-April 2020 and mid-February 2021. I commend the motion to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:41</span>):  Labor supports this bill, and we support the bills which are to follow: the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund Bill 2018 and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018. My colleague, the member for Barton, will speak to the latter two bills. I'm proposing to address some comments to the first of these bills. I think it's useful for the parliament, in considering these bills, to put them in their historical context, which really does start with the Mabo judgementâa landmark decision of the High Court of Australia handed down on 3 June 1992, which, of course, as we all know, overturned the long-held assumption of Australia's settlement, that the land belonged to no-one, and recognised the continuing title of First Nations people to land. The judgement recognised in Australian common law that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's traditional title to land, or native title, had survived the British settlement of the continent, and the judgement found that native title had been extinguished by many of the titles granted to other Australians by successive Australian governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shortly after the Mabo judgements were handed down, the federal government, led by Prime Minister Keating, sought to codify native title in legislation through a process of negotiation with Indigenous leaders. The first part of the settlement was the Native Title Act 1993, which passed through this parliament in December 1993. The Native Title Act codifies the definition of native title and establishes a process for its recognition where there has not been extinguishment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The land fund, now officially known as the Land Account, was the second part of the settlement with the First Nations people of this continent. At the time, government and Indigenous leaders were conscious that many Indigenous Australians had seen their traditional country overlay with the land titles of other Australians. The Land Account therefore provides a mechanism for some compensation for the dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples since 1788. The Land Account was established with legislated appropriations over 10 years to build a capital base, after which the account's own income would support the operations of a new statutory authority created at the same time as the Land Account, the Indigenous Land Corporation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since that time, the ILC has used the land account to purchase property for the use and enjoyment of the Indigenous Australians whose native title has been extinguished. After 20 years, the ILC began to initiate a review into its functions. From early July to the beginning of September 2017 the ILC undertook a series of consultations to gain community feedback on legislative changes to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005, the ATSI Act, on two key issuesâthe first being the financial sustainability of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Amendment land account and the second being the ILC's remit to include fresh and salt water based activities. Sixteen consultations took place around the country involving more than 75 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the report that was produced on the consultation, 75 per cent of the consultation sessions provided consensus support for both areas of proposed reform. More than 85 per cent of sessions provided consensus support to the reform of management and governance arrangements for the land account. There was unanimous support for reform to the investment mandate of the land account expressed in the written submissions that dealt with that issue and, of the 17 submissions that addressed both issues, 77 per cent gave support to both with only eight per cent indicating they did not support the reform relating to water.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 28 March 2018 the government introduced two substantive pieces of legislation, and one piece of consequential legislation, to alter the functions and governance of the Indigenous Land Corporation, the ILC, and the Indigenous land account. As I've said, my colleague the member for Barton will be addressing the latter two bills. I'm addressing the first bill, which deals with the Indigenous Land Corporation. What this bill does is to enable the ILC to perform functions in relation to waters, including ground and surface water, where the Commonwealth or the states and territories have sovereign rightsâthat is, in water or waters within the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone of Australia, including internal waters of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill amends the ATSI Act to give the ILC functions in relation to water related rights. These additional functions are to be consistent with the ILC's functions in relation to land. They include: the acquisition of water related rights and divestment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations; the provision of assistance in the form of grants, loans or loan guarantees to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporations to acquire water based rights; the carrying on of management activities in relation to Indigenous waters; and the provision of assistance grants, loans or loan guarantees for the purpose of carrying on management activities in relation to Indigenous waters. The bill does not create any new rights and does not authorise the ILC to exercise its functions in a manner that is inconsistent with the rights and interests of other persons or international law such as the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The bill alters the name of the ILC to the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation to reflect the expansion of the ILC's functions to water. As I've said, Labor supports this bill. It's an appropriate response to the consultation that was conducted by the ILC. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:48</span>):  I'd like to begin by thanking the member for Isaacs for his brevity. It is always good to get his views on the record, particularly on a matter as important as this. In my former role, I spent time working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, including my good friend the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner Mick Gooda, particularly around the challenges facing the use of land under native title for economic development. Having convened round tables in Broome and Sydney on some of the challenges that are faced in this space to realise the economic potential of land, this bill is very welcome because not just prescribed body corporates but also Indigenous land corporations play an important part of the infrastructure that sits around the use of native title lands and the legacy of the Mabo decisionâand, of course, state based regimes as well as the particular issues around title in the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we actually want is an environment where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are able to fully realise their ambitions and their dreams based on the assets that are available to them. And what we have in some of the ILCs is an acquisition program of land of up to $2 billion which enables it to be used for an effective purpose to advance the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who live with the consequences and injustice of displacement that came as a consequence of European settlement. We cannot undo the legacy of the past. What we can do is choose a better future for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. But, more critically, it doesn't actually matter what we, being the people who are in this place right now in this chamber or in the Senate, think, because the pathway for success for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is not for what we can impose on them or do to them. The pathway to success for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is what we can do to empower and support them to realise their own ambitions and their own dreams.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we want, I would have thought, is for more people to take ownership, for people to feel like they are in control of their future and for them to be able to take that controlâthat sense of ownershipâand translate it into better outcomes not just for themselves but also for generations yet to come. I say that because, when it comes to generations yet to come, what we have to do is break the cycle of what has occurred in the pastâwhere many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have felt that this country has not served them and where this country has simply, in its modern form, sought to alienate, isolate or displace their traditions, their culture, their language and, of course, their land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday I spoke in this place on another bill related to some of the housing measures that this government is investing in as part of a framework working with the states. I made the point at the time that, despite how we sometimes think about the transactional nature of housingâand it's an important part of it; we have a market in housing that needs to be supported and a private market that works successfully for the most part but doesn't meet everybody's needs because of people's economic circumstances and sometimes the constraints we place on it which make it beyond the reach of many people who would otherwise seek to rely upon itâwithout a house, but more critically without a home, as the bedrock of stability in people's lives, there are huge consequences for how people then go on to live their lives. It's a truism and a statement of the bleeding obvious, but in practice we take it for granted. If people don't have that bedrock of their lifeâthat foundational stone of a homeâthey can't then go on and achieve so much of what is frankly the habit of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all have lived experience when we come into this parliament. It's not reserved for me, those on the other side, those on this side or even yourself, Mr Speaker. It is the lived experience. Part of the reason why we stand here is because we have succeeded in harnessing the potential that's available to us, and that's off the back of routine and stability and then the capacity to use that to leverage to a more successful life, including, frankly, the confidence to put yourself out into the public and have your ideas, your values and your confidence tested against a community and, ultimately, the scrutiny of the Australian people. The story is no different for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. When you sever a connection between a people and the place they call home, particularly when the connection is more than just a transactional relationship around what is owned at a time but a relationship around what is seen as being an enduring custodianship as connected directly to a place, a home, a culture and a language that in people's mindsets brings them a sense of safety, the consequences are quite severe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are not alone in this. There are many other cultures around the world who have similar journeys and similar challenges and countries that continue to face the consequences of that. That's why taking simple and practical measures to redress the legacy of that severed connection is so critical as part of rebuilding that sense of place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this bill is designed to enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders' land account, which funds the ILCs, to be used for as constructive a purpose as possible, becauseâwhile we might capitalise the basis of that ownership and that heritage in financial resources, to be able to go on and do things into the futureâwe have to make sure that it's sustainable and that no money is wasted. So part of the very pragmatic reform of this government is to recognise that the place for such funds is with the Future Fundânot because we wish to control it but simply because of the capacity to deliver returnsâso as to provide that basis for a sustainable future for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and the ILCs, so they are able to secure the funding that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've done exactly the same thingâand this is where I think it's important to draw the parallelâfor superannuation liabilities for public servants under the Future Fund, for this place and this modern structure. In doing so, we're setting a standard against which we're able to hold ourselves but also others. The ambition now for the Future Fund should be not just to hold the capital that's available to themâto be able to do what is right and meet the expectations and obligations set out in their charter and their courseâbut also to generate income and potential so that we can help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people thrive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's on that basisâa very simple, pragmatic basisâthat I support this piece of legislation. It follows, as the Attorney-General and shadow Attorney-General have outlined, a long process of consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, so that we are working with them and designing laws and regulations that meet their needs; but, more critically, so that there is a trust being built between those who are custodians of this wealth and, of course, the people who seek to govern it, so that we may have a better future and a shared future together.</span>

                    <a href="IJ4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:57</span>):  I acknowledge those who have already spoken in this debate. Clearly Labor is supporting this bill, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation) Bill 2018, and the subsequent piece of legislation which will be before us shortly, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund Bill 2018. My contribution will be short, but I do want to go back to the origins of the land fund and the debates and discussions that took place post Mabo and the Native Title Act. I was part of the discussions and the deliberations of this parliament, and I remember distinctly the land fund and its establishment. The purpose for its establishment was to try and give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around the country an opportunity to purchase back some of their own estate. Initially, there was a great effort by the land fund to purchase pastoral leases in different parts of remote Australia. Giving people a land base was seen to be very important. The fund has changed its expenditure profile over the decades since. But, importantly, it was an absolute recognition of the need to address the alienation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from their country. From that perspective, it was, truly, really very, very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A trifecta of things were to happen: first, the native title legislation; second, the establishment of the land fund; third, a social justice package, which, sadly, has never been implemented. I suspect we wouldn't be now discussing issues around housing and poverty in remote parts of Australia, and the lack of educational or employment opportunities all over Australia, had we had that social justice package developed and implemented at that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Keating government got defeated; the Howard government got elected; and they were just disregarded. The land fund had been set up, so it was tolerated, but, of course, one of the subsequent things that the Howard government did was abolish ATSIC, so there was a sort of distancing of the federal government from the views expressed by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You'll remember the absurd and dreadful statements of the then Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, over the Wik claim. I'm not sure if you recall it, but I do. The High Court made a decision about the Wik peoples' claim. The then Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the National Party, pilloried the High Court for acknowledging the right of the Wik people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'd come from where the Mabo decision, a High Court decision, had led to the native title legislationâa very difficult piece of legislation to get passed through the parliament, I might say. We had then had some sort of unifying with the passage of that legislation, the setting up of the land fund and the recognition that the absurd notion of terra nullius had been expunged. We then had the Howard government crawling its way, clawing its way, trying to take back the rights that Aboriginal people had been provided. We saw that absurd and very dreadful and insulting behaviour by the Deputy Prime Minister of this country. Nevertheless, we're not here to talk about him today, thank goodness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are here to do is recognise that this is an advance. The land fund has been in existence and has been operating successfully. Obviously, there is debate in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community about the priorities of the fund from time to time. But this bill is important because it acknowledges that there ought to be a capacity for the land fund to deal with matters to do with seas and water. If we understand the implications of that, it may mean the oceans, but it may also mean purchasing water rights for properties, for example. The additional functions that have been proposed in this legislation are to be consistent with the ILC's functions in relation to land and include the acquisition of water related rights and divestment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations, which is important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The acquisition of these rights is not for the land fund or the ILC but for the purpose and use of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, in this case on their land. These rights should be divested. These are not property rights which should be retained by the ILC. The properties which are purchased by the ILC are for the benefit and use of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and should be divested to them, and that's what this proposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provision of assistance, grants, loans or loan guarantees to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations to acquire water based rights is a very welcome proposal. The carrying on of management activities in relation to Indigenous waters and the provision of assistance, grants, loans or loan guarantees for the purpose of carrying on management activities in relation to those Indigenous waters are important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've now no longer, thankfully, got the hideousness of the sorts of attitudes, at least in this parliament, that I've seenâsorry, I should say there might be a small segment in the other place that might actually mirror the statements which were made by that hideous person who was then the Deputy Prime Minister. Nevertheless, I think we have advanced a great deal so that native title is no longer in conjecture. We recognise that the rights and interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people need to be properly addressed and the way to address them. This piece of legislation advances us by ensuring that we can look after the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in relation to water rights, and that is most welcome. This is an important piece of legislation, and I'm happy to be able to support it.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WYATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care and Minister for Indigenous Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:05</span>):  I would like to thank honourable members for their contribution to the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation) Bill 2018. This bill represents a significant step forward in Australia's land rights journey. The Indigenous Land Corporation was established as part of the government's response to the High Court decision in Mabo No. 2 in recognition that many Indigenous people would be unable to benefit under the Native Title Act 1993. The Indigenous Land Corporation was established to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to acquire land and to manage Indigenous held land so as to provide economic, environmental, social and cultural benefits for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Land is not defined within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005. On a plain language interpretation, this means the Indigenous Land Corporation cannot support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to conduct activity in freshwater and sea country. For example, it cannot support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to strengthen their connection with culture and communities through activities in freshwater and sea country; manage freshwater and sea country to keep culturally significant plant and animals healthy; or establish fishing businesses. This is inconsistent with the understanding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have of country. This is also inconsistent with developments in case law recognising that native title rights can extend to freshwater and sea country. In some cases, these rights include rights to take and use water for a variety of purposes and to take resources from certain waters. The law now acknowledges that, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, land and water are inseparable parts of country. It is now time for the functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation to reflect this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms follow extensive consultations with Indigenous stakeholders. A clear majority of stakeholders supported changes to expand the remit of the Indigenous Land Corporation to include freshwater and sea country. The government has listed and is now enabling the Indigenous Land Corporation to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to care for, manage and benefit from freshwater and sea country. In its report on the bill, the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee recommended that the bill be amended to ensure that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005 gives the Indigenous Land Corporation the function to manage water or waters in which the Indigenous Land Corporation has water related rights. Amendments agreed to in this House respond to the committee's recommendation. These amendments will mean the Indigenous Land Corporation's water management functions are consistent with its land management functions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also rename the Indigenous Land Corporation the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation to reflect the expansion of its remit to include water. Expanding the remit will enable the Indigenous Land Corporation to reflect the understanding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have of country. It will also enable the Indigenous Land Corporation to support the full range of opportunities for Indigenous economic development in sectors such as fisheries, agriculture and tourism. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms represent a significant step in Australia's land rights journey. By expanding the functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation to rights in relation to water, this government is realising its commitment to improving the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to begin, particularly when we are talking about these issues, by recognising country and paying our respects appropriately. I also want to pick up something that the member for Lingiari mentioned in relation to another piece of legislation, which this is connected to, when it was last debated in this parliament. It is in relation to the social justice package which was the third part of the Mabo High Court decision. I was personally involved in the consultations and the development of that social justice package under the leadership of Paul Keating. And the member for Lingiari is absolutely right: had there not been a change of government, we would not be seeing some of the social disadvantage and dislocation experienced by First Nations communities that we are still seeing today. One of the great tragedies in the last 20 years in the Indigenous affairs space is the lack of implementation of that social justice package. I think if people pulled out that social justice package today and had a look at it, it would be as relevant today as it was at the time of its development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to remind ourselves that on 3 June 1992 the High Court of Australia delivered the Mabo judgement overturning the long-held assumption of Australia's settlement. Whether it was settlement is contested. Of course, it was taught to us at school as settlement. From an Aboriginal perspective, it was nothing of the sort. The land belonged to no-one. In recognising the continuing title of First Nations people to land. I think it's really significant that we pause and remind ourselves about 3 June 1992. It was one of those moments in our nation's history that defined us. I remember absolutely where I was and what I was doing. I was listening to the radio, driving down City Road towards Sydney city, when I heard the Mabo decision saying terra nullius had been overturned. To me, as a First Nations woman, that was a moment when tears sprang to our eyes because for 200 years in this country we had the idea that First Nations people didn't existâbecause the way in which this land was usurped, of course, was using the doctrine of terra nullius.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from the many things that have been highlighted already by both speakers on this side of the House, we must remind ourselves that the notion of terra nullius was overturned in the Mabo judgement. The judgement recognised in Australian common law that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' traditional title to land, native title, had survived the British settlement of the continent. Once again, we contest that notion of settlementâI certainly do. It also found that native title had been extinguished by many of the titles granted to other Australians by successive Australian governments. And that was also absolutely crucial. I know this incredibly well. Despite Rob Borbidge and Tim Fischer's disgusting campaign saying backyards were under threat and your Hills hoist was going to go, the truth of that decision was that native title only existed if all other title had been extinguished. That's a very important point to make in this debate as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, that decision also found that native title had been extinguished by many other titles granted to other Australians by successive Australian governments. Shortly thereafter, the federal government, led by Prime Minister Keating, sought to codify native title in legislation through a process of negotiation with Indigenous leaders. We remember that time very, very well. Many of us in this debate were part of that historyâcertainly the member for Hasluck, the member for Lingiari and me. The first part of the settlement was the Native Title Act 1993, legislated in December 1993. The Native Title Act codified and defined native title and established a process for its negotiationâwhere there had been, as I have said, no extinguishment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The land fund, now officially known as the land account, was the second part of that settlement and, as the member for Lingiari explained, the third part was supposed to be the social justice package. At the time, the government and Indigenous leaders were conscious that many Indigenous Australians had seen their traditional country overlaid by land titles by other Australians. It was a magnificent time in our history. There was the Cape York land agreement and many other things that I think would be very difficult to achieve in today's climate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The land account provides a mechanism for some compensation for dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples since 1788. The land account was established with legislated appropriations over 10 years to build a capital base, after which the account's own income would support the operations of a new statutory authority, created at the same time as the land account, the Indigenous Land Corporationânot too different to the philosophical background of the establishment of the New South Wales Land Rights Act and the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since that time, the ILC has used the land account to purchase property for the use and enjoyment of Indigenous Australians whose native title has been extinguished. After 20 years, the ILC began to initiate a review into its functions. I think one of the shining examples in the city that I live in of the ILC's success in this is the purchase of the property in Redfern, the National Centre of Indigenous Excellence, which is something that all Australians can be absolutely proud of. It is a shining example of just how important this fund is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From early July to the beginning of September 2017, the ILC undertook a series of consultations to gain community feedback on legislative changes to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005âfirstly, the financial sustainability of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land account and, secondly, the extension of the ILC's remit to include fresh and saltwater based activitiesâand, culturally, that is extremely important. There were 16 consultations, with 11 undertaken in locations around Australia, involving more than 75 First Nations organisations. So it was a very comprehensive consultationâand, appropriately, right across this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the report produced, 75 per cent of the consultation sessions provided consensus support for both areas of proposed reform. That's quite fantastic. More than 85 per cent of the sessions provided consensus support to the reform of management and government arrangements of the land account. Unanimous support for reform to the investment mandate of the land account was expressed in the written submissions that dealt with this issue. Of the 17 submissions that addressed both issues, 77 per cent gave support to both, with only eight per cent indicating they did not support the reform relating to water. The reason that we are seeing in this House right now support for these initiatives is that those consultations provided the basis for consensus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the legislation, on 28 March 2018, the government introduced two substantive pieces of legislation and one piece of consequential legislation to alter the functions and governance of the ILC and the ILA. The first bill amends the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act to give the ILC functions in relation to water-related rights. I cannot underscore just how important it is that water-related rights are included in this. We know that, in Aboriginal dreaming stories and in Aboriginal culture, the issue of water, both freshwater and saltwater, absolutely underpin the culture, the ownership and the occupation of lands and waters. Many of our stories originate in waters, and those rights to land are not extinguished at the shore line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These additional functions to be consistent with the ILC's functions in relation to land include: the acquisition of water related rights and divestment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations; the provision of assistance grants loans and loan guarantees to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporations to acquire water based rights, which is also incredibly significant; the carrying on of management activities in relation to Indigenous waters; and the provision of assistance grants loans or loan guarantees for the purpose of carrying on management activities in relation to Indigenous waters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might just, for the edification of the House, explain a little bit. Among the many ways in which Aboriginal people describe ourselves, we are either a saltwater or a freshwater person. I and, I think, Ken are freshwater.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  My associations go back to the good old Murrumbidgee River. I am of the Murrumbidgee Wiradjuri.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second bill gives effect to the government's decision to establish a dedicated financial asset fundâI won't go through the acronym for that; it's very long!âto support the making of annual and discretionary additional payments to the ILC. This fund will replace the Indigenous Land Account, and we spoke about that earlier, the closure of which will be effected by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018. The bill provides for the transfer of the moneys and financial assets currently allocated to the land account to the new fund, which will be managed by the Future Fund board. That all sounds very bureaucratic, and it probably is, but it's important to outline these arrangements in the House today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ATSILSFF will be credited with amounts equal to the balance of the land account special account and the value of the investments of the land account. This special account will then be debited to provide an annual payment to the ILC to be credited to and paid for from the ILC funding special account. The finance minister and the Indigenous Affairs minister may also determine once a financial year that an additional payment be made to the ILC after considering the advice of the Future Fund board about the impact of any additional payment on the sustainability of annual amounts to the ILC. That component is also very importantâthat there is the continuing discretion of the ministers involved to be able to undertake those discretionary payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Fund board will be responsible for deciding how to invest the new fund to enhance the Commonwealth's ability to make annual payments for any additional payments to the ILC. The bill requires a responsible minister to issue an investment mandate to the Future Fund board, and that's very much about accountability regarding the investments of the new fund. The purpose of the investment mandate is to provide a mechanism for the government to provide strategic guidance to the Future Fund board on its expectations for the investment of the new fund. That also is incredibly important to the government of the day and to First Nations people. The Indigenous Land Account has achieved an average return over the past three years of approximately CPI plus 1.5 per cent per annum. Under the new arrangements, the government expects that account will achieve a returnâand this is really importantâof CPI plus 2.6 per cent after fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a few other points I'd like to make in closing. Expenses associated with the investment and administration of the fund incurred by the Future Fund board will be met by ATSILSFF. I want to put forward what the Labor position is. You can see that with me putting forward this position how much work has gone into making sure that this is for the benefit of those it has been designed for. Labor supports the intent of this legislation. We accept the need to improve the financial sustainability of the fund and we support the expansion of the remit of the fund to cover water. However, after consultation with stakeholders, we took the view that there were a number of ways in which the legislation could be strengthenedâand I understand there's been discussion on thisâin order to protect the land fund for future generations. We have requested a number of minor amendments to the bill which we believe will achieve that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, we have requested of the government that they include provisions in the bill that the minister must have regard to the sustainability of the fund prior to making any additional transfers. I'm sure that minor amendment is something that the government could accommodate. This will help to ensure that these transfers are not used to deplete the fund over time. We also requested that the long-term sustainability be a necessary consideration where the minister sets out the investment mandate. I'm sure that the minister would be considering that as a matter of course. I am pleased that the government has now moved amendments to address both of those issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our second concern is related to the removal of any oversight role of the ILC in relation to the fund. That's important because, when you've got the ILC as the board, they need to understand what's going on in terms of any investments. At present, the ILC board provides oversight of the account. This is not an active oversight role, but, rather, a way for the ILC board to maintain a clear line of sight as to how the account is being invested. Once again, that's a very sensible suggestion. The bill before us, in its original form, removed this. We did not support this. I'll say that again: the bill before us, in its original form, removed this and we did not support this. At a time when there were growing calls for a greater Indigenous say over issues that impact on Indigenous lives, we felt the removal of the oversight was inconsistent with the need to maintain as much Indigenous involvement as possible. We do welcome the government's decision to require the Future Fund brief of the ILC board on their investment decisions, restoring that important oversight of the ILC. We thank the government for that recognition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this will be a passive oversight role that is not designed to interfere with the functions of the Future Fund but, rather, to ensure that the fund, which is designed to assist Indigenous Australians, is never removed entirely from Indigenous involvementâonce again, going very much forward with a philosophical view of the involvement of First Nations people. We also welcome the amendment that will require the minister to consult with the ILC in relation to the investment mandate. This, once again, provides an opportunity for important input from First Nations people into the management of the fund. We believe that these amendments strengthen the bill. We recognise the minister for working with us to achieve a bipartisan position. Having reached agreement on these matters, Labor is happy to support this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  I want to thank the member for Barton for her contribution. She's very appropriately outlined, in very much detail, our support for the legislation, the features of the legislation and our concerns about some aspects of the legislation which have been picked up and addressed by the government, so we've now got a bill we're able to support. I want to make a couple of observations. One observation I want to make that is of particular importance is that the ILC board retains some oversight role of the account. Whilst the Future Fund, of course, is responsible for its investments et cetera, ultimately the ILC board is charged with the responsibility of making sure that the funds for which they have been made responsible are dealt with properly and appropriately, so they need to have a clear line of sight as to how the account is being invested.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the comments made by the member for Barton around those issues. We welcome, as she said, the government's decision to require that the Future Fund brief the ILC Board on their investment decisions, in a sense restoring the capacity of the ILC to oversee, as a part of its responsibilities, the investments which are being made. It's obviously a passive role. It's not a role which is designed to give them the capacity to interfere with the Future Fund's decisions, but it is important nevertheless. We're of the view, as the shadow minister said, that these proposals strengthen the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to go back to my friend's discussion around Mabo and just try to bring it into a current context. My memories of those days are really strong. The debates which took place in this parliament were enlivened not only by some great, great orators in the parliament itself but also, most particularly, by Aboriginal leaders outside the parliament. Current Senator Dodson was part of a group of people who spent a lot of time negotiating with the Prime Minister, Paul Keating, and a cabinet subcommittee of which I was a member around the content of the native title legislation and what should happen as a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to just say that we're going through a process external to this parliament in a sense, and there's a parliamentary committee of which I'm a member and the member for Barton is a member looking at the issues to do with constitutional recognition. When we're contemplating it, we're very far removed from the engagement that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had then with the processes of this parliament. Currently, they're largely not to be seen, and that is a shame. One of the reasons for that is that there's no national body. At the time of this discussion around Mabo and the legislation, ATSIC was alive. ATSIC was alive as a body which represented the voice of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and was very much part of and central to the discussions with government. There has been a call for a structure to be set upâa voiceâwhich will give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people the capacity to interface again with ministers, prime ministers and the parliament. If only it existed today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We, I think, have a responsibility in this place to understand that there's a huge vacuum which is there as a result of the displacement, initially, of ATSIC. Sadly, because of the failure of the present government and its predecessor to recognise and fund the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples, we don't have a body which has been properly resourced and can be seen to be representative of the interests and views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around this country. It's very important for us. In 1992, there was Mabo and the legislation subsequently, which was all the result of constant interaction with Aboriginal people on the ground and at a leadership level here in Canberra. We've now got different groups coming to see us, but there's no organised structure through which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can express their views, apart from the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples, which, as I said, has not been resourced properly and is finding it very difficult to carry out its remit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a responsibility here to think about these things in the context of this legislation. This legislation was arrived at because of the activities that happened in the 1990s, not because of something that's happening today. This was set in place, set in stone, by former Prime Minister Keating and his government as a result of the Mabo decision and the native title legislation and the negotiations which took place with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through the leadership that was expressed through ATSIC and those other organisations that were at the table. They were seen to represent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander interests. They were legitimately representing those interests. As a result, we have the native title legislation, the land fund being set up through the ILC, and then the third tranche, as the member for Barton saidâthe social justice packageâdropped off the edge when the Keating government got defeated at the 1996 election. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a long way to go. We can retrace our steps. It won't help us much. What we've got to do is think about what is appropriate now and into the future to give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that place at the table they richly deserve, and which they currently do not have. This is despite the good work of the Minister for Indigenous Health, who is at the table, my friend here the member for Barton, Senator McCarthy and Senator Dodson, who are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this place. They are strong voices and they are seen to be strong voices. But we do not have, external to the parliament, a structure which can be seen to be representing the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and properly representing their views to us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been a series of consultations undertaken to get to this pointâI think 17 was the number I heard. That's terrific. I remember the daysâthis has got little to do with this piece of legislation, but you'll understand what I'm saying hereâwhen the Howard government did a review of the Northern Territory land rights legislation. They employed to do that a person who was a friend of mine: John Reeves QC, now a Federal Court judge. He came down with a set of recommendations around changing the land rights act in the Northern Territory. Aboriginal people around the Northern Territory were consulted. They set up a process to consult themselves through their land councils. I went to regional meetings right around the Northern Territory and saw Aboriginal people burn the report because of their disgust with some of the recommendations within it. Of course, ultimately it went nowhere. It went nowhere because of the strength of their view. They could do that because they had structures to organise, to help them actually articulate their views. Currently we've got a disparate set of structures around the country and we need to be thinking very seriously and making sure this parliament comes to terms with its obligation. Not everyone agrees with what came out of the Statement from the HeartâI understand thatâbut it is just common sense. It is just smart to ensure that Aboriginal people have a voiceâthat they have a voice and are listened to, and are listened to in a way where they are seen to be engaged with properly and not disparaged and have their views disregarded. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is welcome. But we have a responsibility in this place to go a whole lot further. We'll get into discussions about regional agreements and treaties and the like, but we still need a structure. I'd implore particularly some of our colleagues on the other side of this chamber to be thinking positively about it and not see it as a threat. I'm pleased to be able to support this legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care and Minister for Indigenous Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  I would like to thank the honourable members for their contribution to the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund Bill 2018. This bill represents a significant step forward in Australia's land rights journey. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Indigenous Land Corporation was established as part of the government's response to the High Court's decision in Mabo No. 2, in recognition that many Indigenous peoples would be unable to benefit under the Native Title Act 1993. The Indigenous Land Corporation was established to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to acquire land and manage Indigenous held land so as to provide the economic, environmental, social and cultural benefits for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Indigenous Land Corporation is funded by indexed annual payments and sometimes by additional payments from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Account. The land account was established to provide an ongoing, sustainable source of funding for the Indigenous Land Corporation. As at 1 July 2018, the land account had a capital balance of $2 billion. However, a combination of the current investment environment, payment arrangements and the investment restrictions means that the land account is not financially sustainable. These arrangements make it all but impossible for the land account to sustain annual index payments to the Indigenous Land Corporation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund Bill 2018, along with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018, proposes a landmark change to the land account. These changes will mean the land account payment arrangements support the land account's sustainability. Land account funds will be invested in a wider range of investment products and managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills follow extensive consultation with Indigenous stakeholders. A clear majority of stakeholders support changes to improve the sustainability of the land account by allowing land account funds to be invested in broader range of investment products and managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians. The government listened and took these views into account. Through securing sustainable funding arrangements for the Indigenous Land Corporation, these reforms will provide significant long-term benefits to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Under this legislation, the land account, which is currently managed by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, will be closed, and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund will be established, to be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians. The government's reforms will allow the land account funds to be put into the same range of investment products as other funds managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians, and thus have the opportunity to generate higher investment returns. A move from the current narrow range of investments to a broader range requires an experienced investment manager. The Future Fund Board of Guardians is an experienced, specialised and trusted investor of public money, and the government wants the Indigenous Land Corporation to benefit from the Future Fund Board of Guardians' experience over the last decade in managing other Commonwealth investment funds. The Future Fund Board of Guardians currently invests over $164 billion across five public asset funds with different purposes and different mandates. While this transfer will add some complexity to their role, it is consistent with their current operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As noted in the report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee on this bill, these reforms preserve the independence of the Indigenous Land Corporation in making its own decisions on how and where to spend its funds. The investment mandate for the new fund will be set by the Treasurer and the finance minister as the responsible ministers, in consultation with the Future Fund Board of Guardians and the Minister for Indigenous Affairs. The Minister for Indigenous Affairs will, in turn, consult with the Indigenous Land Corporation Board prior to responding to the responsible ministers. Setting up of the investment mandate enables the responsible ministers to articulate the broad, strategic guidance to the Future Fund Board of Guardians regarding investment of the fund. As with the arrangement for other funds currently managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians, the mandate will be set in a manner consistent with Commonwealth objectives for the new fund and with reasonable but not excessive risk. The Future Fund Board of Guardians will be responsible for deciding how to invest the assets of the new fund under the investments mandate. This is consistent with other funds invested by the Future Fund Board of Guardians and preserves the independence of the Future Fund Board of Guardians as a sovereign investor of public money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the new arrangements, annual payments will be unchanged, but additional payments will be altered to support the long-term sustainability of the new fund. Amendments made to this bill strengthen this intent. Annual payments to the Indigenous Land Corporation will be made by the minister for indigenous affairs. The annual payment to the Indigenous Land Corporation will remain indexed by CPI based on an initial payment of $45 million in 2010-11, over $53 million in today's terms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additional payments will be reformed so that they support the sustainability of the new fund. Currently, additional payments are made automatically if the land account capital exceeds a CPI-indexed target, with any excess funds paid to the Indigenous Land Corporation. The government proposes that additional payments be made by the finance minister and the minister for indigenous affairs, having considered the advice from the Future Fund Board of Guardians and any other matters that those ministers consider relevant. This will allow the ministers to decide whether to make an additional payment, based on the impact it will have on the financial sustainability of the new fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee expressed confidence that future additional payments will only occur in circumstances where the new fund's sustainability is not compromised. These new additional payment arrangements will not compromise the financial independence of the Indigenous Land Corporation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As required under the Future Fund Act 2006, the Future Fund Board of Guardians will table an annual report in the parliament which will include information on the performance of the new fund, as is the case with all of the funds managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians. The Future Fund Board of Guardians will also publish quarterly investment performance updates, including investment commentary, on the Future Fund website, consistent with arrangements for other funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government considers that the arrangements for standard reporting requirements relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund should, as closely as possible, mirror those in place for existing funds for the purpose of consistency. Nonetheless, the government will move amendments to ensure that the Indigenous Land Corporation board has the opportunity to discuss the performance of the fund with Commonwealth officials if it so desires and following the publication of the quarterly updates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also allows the finance minister to request that the Future Fund Board of Guardians prepare reports or give information. The finance minister may provide these reports or information to a relevant minister if appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms are crucial to support the Indigenous Land Corporation to continue to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to achieve their economic, environmental, social and cultural goals into the future. By taking these steps to put the Indigenous Land Corporation's funding arrangements on a sustainable footing, this government is realising its commitment to improving the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank honourable members for their contribution to the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill will enable the effective operation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund from commencement. The government has four amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill. This consequential amendments bill accompanies a bill for an act to establish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund. Among other things, this consequential amendments bill provides for amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund Bill 2018 that are contingent on separate legislation that, if enacted, will rename the Indigenous Land Corporation the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation. Amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund Bill 2018 will insert references to the Indigenous Land Corporation board in the bill. These amendments to the consequential amendments bill will replace those references with references to the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation board if legislation to change the name is enacted. I commend the amendments and the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="8GH" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURNEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:59</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017. I have to say at the beginning of my contribution that perhaps the title of the bill could have been something quite different, because I don't believe that this bill addresses the issue of housing affordability in this country in any way whatsoever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the vast majority of social housing tenants do the right thing and pay their rent on time, and have done so for many a long year. We also know that forms of automatic rent deduction may be an appropriate measure in protecting vulnerable individuals from falling into homelessness. Labor is very supportive of a system of rent deduction that is used only in very specific circumstances and is designed to protect vulnerable Australians. But that is not what this bill is doing. This is a blunt instrument that risks exacerbating the already difficult and challenging financial circumstances that vulnerable Australians in social housing find themselves in. Labor are also very aware of some of the challenges at the state level, and our proposed amendments, which will be dealt with at some point in the discussion of this bill, address those two issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme proposed in this bill is far too broad in its application, and that makes it extremely difficult for Labor to support all the changes that this bill is proposing. Community groups in this space have expressed serious concerns that the government's plan will drive vulnerable individuals into poverty. The Liberals' plan to allow the compulsory and arbitrary deduction of income support and family assistant payments from tenants living in public and community housing sums up their attitude towards housing affordability. I think it also sums up their attitude towards Australians struggling with the cost of housing. It would apply, importantly, to people on disability support pensions and, most significantly, people on age pensions. Those opposite have no serious plan to address housing affordability. In this bill they have no serious plan to tackle homelessness, no action to improve mental health services in this context and certainly no additional assistance to women fleeing domestic violence. All they have is a plan to arbitrarily chip away at financial assistance and support for low-income and vulnerable Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that this is a government that refuses to actually take any meaningful action on making housing more affordable. The government have refused to reform negative gearing. They have slashed the cap on dwellings under the National Rental Affordability Scheme. This is a government whose idea of a housing affordability strategy is to ask your parents to buy you a house, which says to me that they just don't get it. I know that in my own family circle there are a number of young people who have just given up on the idea of ever owning their own home, particularly in a major city. And that is not just the view of people in my own circle. I know it is the view of many young people. It seems to me that it is one of the great challenges in front of all of us in the political process. This government is out of touch and out of ideas when it comes to those issues, and ordinary, vulnerable Australians are paying the price. It is divisive and inconsistent. It's a policy scramble.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the National Rental Affordability Scheme component of this bill, Labor does support taking action to protect against fraud and providers that are not doing the right thing. That part of the bill we absolutely support. We understand the government will make amendments to address Labor's concerns with the NRAS part of the bill and we will support the government in doing so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill proposes to create an automatic rent deduction scheme which can be mandatorily applied to public or community housing tenants who receive income support or family assistance payments. We think that's just too broad. As I said, we support mandatory rent deduction in certain circumstances but not arbitrarily, as this bill puts forward. Schedule 1 will enable state and territory community housing providers to withhold a portion of tenants' income support payments and use those funds to directly pay rent, utilities and other costs related to the dwelling on behalf of those tenants. Schedule 2 will enable providers to do this with family tax benefit payments. Schedule 3 makes changes to the administration of the National Rental Affordability Scheme by removing ambiguity in relation to the calculation of below-market rents in any given year, by providing flexibility in the way maximum vacancy period are prescribed and by authorising the variation of conditions to allocation and the transfer allocations to low-rent dwellings. I will speak in more detail about the amendments to NRAS shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 and 2 go to automatic rent deduction schemes. Currently some housing tenants who are on income support can elect to have the Department of Human Services withhold a portion of their fortnightly payment and have it paid directly to their housing provider to cover rent and bills like utilities. This is called the Rent Deduction Scheme. Currentlyâand this is a very good outcomeâ86 per cent of public and social housing tenants use the Rent Deduction Scheme. It's also a very salient point in terms of the amendments that Labor is proposing to move. This bill will make the Rent Deduction Scheme compulsory. Going forward under the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme, everyone who receives an income support payment or family tax benefit and lives in either public housing or community housing could have part of their payment withheld by Centrelink and paid directly to their housing provider whether they consent to it or not. Like the voluntary scheme, this amount would also cover both rent and bills like utilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be up to each state and territory to decide whether they want to be part of the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme and, if so, how it would apply in their jurisdiction. We know, however, that the Victorian government and the ACT government have both said they will not participate in this scheme. Labor's rent deduction scheme is something that has been sitting with us as a party for some time. When Labor was last in government we tried to introduce an automatic rent deduction scheme. That was some five years ago. Labor did this pursuant to the recommendation from the housing and homelessness white paper entitled 'The Road Home'. The purpose of Labor's proposed rent deduction scheme was to protect vulnerable individuals at risk of homelessnessâand it was targeted in its scope, unlike the broad brush of this particular piece of legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's scheme, on the other hand, according to the National Social Security Rights Network, proposes a very broad management scheme for social housing, which ignores the complex causes of homelessness. Labor's proposal was targeted in that it would have applied to individuals who are in arrears and at risk of homelessness. The Liberals' scheme, on the other hand, will be a blunt and cold instrument that could be applied to everyone, irrespective of their circumstances. The government's scheme would encompass pensioners, people on the disability support pension and those on carer payments. Labor's proposal also capped rental deductions to ensure that people were not left without any ability to manage their affairs, meet their other commitments and put food on the table. The government's bill, on the other hand, does not place any limit on the amount of deductions, potentially leaving people with very little, or nothing, to live on. Labor's proposal would have required tenants to be properly advised of any changes in amounts withheldâand then they would at least have some say in what's happening to them. Labor's scheme could have exempted deductions for compensation made for damage caused by others, including as a result of domestic and family violence. This proposal does not do that. The Liberal bill, as it stands, could mean a tenant experiencing family or domestic violence could be liable for damage caused by an abusive partner. I don't understand how you could actually even countenance that if you know anything about family violenceâalthough I understand that the government may consider moving amendments to address this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has serious concerns about the impact the government scheme will have on social housing tenants. It could push them further into housing stress and poverty. In particular, they have expressed concerns about the arbitrary nature of the scheme. That's at the heart of what our issues areâthe arbitrary nature of the scheme, depriving tenants of the ability to flexibly respond to upcoming financial obligations. The Tenants' Union of New South Wales said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will remove agency from social housing tenants and prevent them from being able to manage their own finances. It will add layers of complexity to social housing tenancy agreements where allegations of end-of-tenancy costs or rent arrears are made, and in many cases will place vulnerable households under extreme financial stress in a way that is simply not warranted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand the intent of these proposals, and Labor's position is well understood by the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There could be medical emergencies; there could be car repairs; there could be medical or dental expensesâthose are some of the urgent ones. According to St Vincent de Paul, 'This may mean a short-term delay in paying rent, but enables the person on a very low income to manage their budget without having to report to charity. Those forced into the ARDS will have less control of their budget when crises arise.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that public and community housing tenants are good tenants. The Parliamentary Library also advises that, over the five years from 2011-12 to 2015-16, national rent collection rates have averaged over 99 per cent across public housing, community housing and state owned and managed Indigenous housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To that end, the government's proposed scheme is quite a disproportionate response. The government's proposed scheme is a policy looking for a crisis. It is the government looking for yet another way to demonise vulnerable Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Labor's amendments: Labor does not support an automatic rent deduction scheme that is arbitrary. We do support, as I said, automatic rent deduction in some circumstances. Automatic rent deduction should only apply where it is part of preventing homelessness, and there should be a focus around these changes. Labor will move amendments in the Senate to ensure automatic rent deductions only occur where people are at risk of arrears and at risk of homelessness, and these deductions will only apply for a temporary period. We will move an amendment to cap the maximum deduction to under 30 per cent of payments to prevent the scheme forcing people into housing stress and to make sure people have money to meet other needsâto pay their bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will also move amendments to require that compulsory deductions can only be made for rent and utilities and not property damage. This is to protect people from being unfairly held responsible for others' actions, including in cases of domestic and family violence, and to protect, as one of my colleagues expressed to me, people who are particularly vulnerable, like people living with a disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor amendments will also prevent deductions being taken from the discretionary portion of an income-managed payment. Deductions should be taken from the quarantined portion of an income support payment. Labor amendments will require social housing landlords to inform the tenant of any changes in the amount to be deducted from their payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's amendments would also ensure that, if a tenant's payment were suspended, the accrued rent could not be deducted when the payment resumed, potentially leaving people with nothing to live on. That's a very important pointâthe way in which arrears are met, and that not all of the arrears can be taken out of the next payment, because that will leave people with literally nothing to put into their cupboards or their fridge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without significant changes to the automatic rent deduction scheme, Labor will not be able to support this part of the bill in the Senate, which is why we are very much hoping that the government will split the bill. We also hope the government will make amendments to the bill to address these concerns. I understand that discussions are underway about that at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has concerns over the interaction of the automatic rent deduction scheme and the deductions being made from income support payments through Centrepay, particularly payments for household goods under consumer leases with businesses such as Radio Rentals, Make It Mine, and Rent The Roo. Consumer leases cost low-income earners up to eight times the retail price of consumer goods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate passed a Labor private senator's bill in the 44th Parliament to exclude consumer leases as an eligible service reason for the purpose of the Centrepay third-party payment system. While Centrepay is closed to payday lenders, it remains open to consumer-leasing businesses which continue to inflict financial hardship on low-income earners. Labor remains committed to excluding consumer leasing as an eligible service for Centrepay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate inquiry heard overwhelmingly that rental arrears are not the main cause of social-housing evictions and that homelessness in Australia cannot be tackled without addressing issues of mental health, domestic violence and the lack of affordable housing. A Shorten Labor government would take a holistic approach to the issues of homelessness to ensure that all causes of homelessness and housing insecurity are addressed on rental arrears and a small number of social-housing tenants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">NRAS is a Labor program, and Labor will not oppose changes that the government has put forward to the NRAS that helped the achievement of the scheme's objective of increasing and maintaining the supply of affordable rental dwellings and reducing rental costs for low- and moderate-income households. Labor's original scheme provided for 50,000 new, affordable rental dwellings to be built. Given the strong interest in the scheme, Labor undertook to extend the scheme by a further 35,000 dwellings, providing a total of 85,000 dwellings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2014-15 budget, the Abbott government announced that NRAS would be capped at 38,000 dwellings. That decision has been widely criticised by the housing sector stakeholders, including the Property Council of Australia, the Housing Industry Association, the Urban Development Institute, Homelessness Australia, National Shelter, Mission Australia, ACOSS, the federation of community housing associations, Anglicare, St Vincent de Paul Society and many others. The short-sighted decision of the Abbott government, along with its failure to bridge the funding gap, has severely curtailed the supply of affordable rental housing in this country. Housing policy experts are unanimous that bridging the funding gap is essential to improving housing affordability and securing better housing outcomes for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will support changes to NRAS that will encourage approved participants to retain their dwellings in the scheme and which minimise the loss of dwellings to the scheme. While we support changes contained in the bill to ensure rents for NRAS dwellings are at all times at least 20 per cent below the market rent valuations for the dwellings, Labor believes there needed to be some additional flexibility to allow unintentional rent overcharges to be refunded or credited to rent in a timely manner. The alternative is for approved participants and investors to face penalties in the form of reduced incentive payments for minor, technical and unintended breaches of the rental charge provisions which could easily be remedied by a timely refund or credit to the tenant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor therefore welcomes the proposed amendments by the government following the Senate inquiry. These amendments are consistent with recommendations in the Labor senator's dissenting report. This includes an amendment that will permit the National Rental Affordability Scheme Regulations 2008 to include a power for the Secretary of the Department of Social Services to create a 'dispensation to 20 per cent at all times' rule for approved participants where there has been an unintentional overcharging of rent and the tenant has been compensated for the error. Labor will be supporting the government amendments to NRAS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, can I make these points: this bill does nothing to advance housing affordability and it does nothing to address homelessness. That is clear. This government is lacking vision in our view and lacks a genuine interest in tackling these issues which mean so, so much to many Australians, particularly young Australians. The government fails to acknowledge negative gearing as a key policy area in need of reform. The government has slashed dwellings under the National Rental Affordability Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has time and time again demonised income support recipients and vulnerable Australians. It has slashed $1 billion in pensioner concessions. It has changed the assets test, cutting the pension for 370 pensioners in this country. It has tried to cut pension indexation, which would have left pensioners $80 per week worse off. It has tried to axe the energy supplement of 1.5 million pensioners. It is trying to raise the pension age to 70. Centrelink call wait times and payment times have blown out exponentially. In the currently form, the automatic rent deduction scheme proposed in this bill would further demonise social security recipients, which is why I have consulted with my colleagues and have put forward the amendments that we have outlined. The uncaring nature and the unfair way in which the government is treating welfare recipients is reprehensible, and I believe the public is becoming aware of that.</span>

In contrast, Labor takes an evidence based approach on policy issues. It is my sincere hope and expectation that the government will also take this approach and agree to the changes to the automatic rent deduction scheme that Labor has called for. I move:</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017 introduces a framework that builds on the voluntary rent deduction scheme and makes it automatic. It allows for rent and utilities to be deducted from income support payments and family tax benefits for occupants who are living in social housing. It also makes amendments to the National Rental Affordability Scheme Act 2008 so that it streamlines and simplifies the administration of the NRAS until it ceases operations in 2026-27.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As other members in this House have mentioned, it is part of the broader policy to help people who are at risk of becoming homeless. I just want to say a few words about the scale of that. There are actually about 10,000 people at any one time in social housing who aren't up to date on their rental payments and about 2,500 people are actually evicted because of their failure to pay. There are many who are in rental arrears. This system allows their rental payment responsibilities to be automatically deducted from their income support payments. It is a good initiative. I have quite a lot of people in this situation in my electorate. We have many people who are in receipt of income support payments and family tax benefits. The community housing sector and the private rental market has this phenomenon happening only too often, but this only applies to people in community housing. So it is specific, but it does address a real problem. It was defined in the 2016-17 budget after a request from the states and territories, and they are the ones that do operate a lot of these social housing initiatives; housing commission and/or community housing is in their space. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a precondition in the scheme, the minister responsible for housing in one of those relevant states or territories must write to the Commonwealth Minister for Social Services, setting out the social housing policies of that state or territory and how these policies protect tenants from financial hardship. The automatic rent deduction scheme deductions are limited. It's not just automatic deductions willy-nilly; it's limited to the amounts that are due for rent and the utilities that are bundled up in that rent in the social housing space. Any arrears that are incurred due to the suspension of an income support payment cannot be deducted from a single payment under the ARDS when the payment recommences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Barton said that they were going to move an amendment about people in the cashless debit card trial or under income management to limit the deductions from that quarantined period. Under these amendments, that is already there. If you are part of an income management scheme or a cashless debit card trial, deductions will only be taken from the restricted portion of the income support payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other amendments are to the National Rental Affordability Scheme. Schedule 3 of the bill refers to changes in the NRAS operations. It is a scheme that is designed to deliver a vast amount of cheaper-than-market rent into areas where there is rental stress. You only have to look at some of the rents in the capital cities of Sydney, Melbourne and, to a lesser extent, Brisbane to realise how expensive some of these metropolitan rents are. The NRAS was set up to assist people such as essential service workers and low-income workers who couldn't afford to work in the cities where their services were needed. But there are always things that don't turn out the way you think they are going to. There are people further up the chain in the scheme who aren't passing on the payments that they receive under the NRAS to the investors in the scheme who are providing these houses. Some of these amendments will correct this problem. They give the government general regulation-making power to enable it to make changes to the NRAS regulations to protect those investors up until 2026, when the NRAS ceases operating. There are other amendments that allow specific regulation-making powers to support the operation of the NRAS and to further protect investors through changes which include requiring the participants to pass on the state and territory payments to those people who have provided the building and made the investment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this scheme, 99.5 per cent of the middlemen are honest and they pass on the funds that they receive from the states and territories. But, no matter what scheme governments develop, there's always someone that will abuse the system, unfortunately. It came to my attention when I was in the ministry in this section that there were some people who were rogue operators, and they weren't passing on the payments. But this will allow the regulations to make that mandatory. It will also give special dispensation where a tenant is inadvertently charged more than the 80 per cent limit, provided the tenant is compensated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned, a small number of approved participants do not do the right thing, and that's where these regulations are aimed at. It's not to make the scheme harder to operate; it's to make it fair and just. It will also allow regulatory actions if there are other episodes of undesirable conduct. The amendments will also permit the Secretary of the Department of Social Services to accept an enforceable undertaking from an approved participant if the approved participant is told, 'You have to behave.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to putting in place measures to reduce the risk of homelessness for social housing tenants and to reduce rental costs for low- and moderate-income households. This bill will do that. It is a scheme that is delivering benefits in many parts. There are NRAS schemes out in regional Australia which are making modern houses available to people on low and middle incomes who really deserve somewhere decent to stay. In some of these regional areas there is actually a shortage of housing. So it's been of benefit to both metropolitan and regional. But, as I said, when participants in the scheme don't pass on the funds that they've received at the top end of the scheme to the people who are actually providing the housing, we have to change the regulations to enforce a change of behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme is a growth on the existing voluntary scheme. It is limited to rent that is due for the community and social housing sector landlords and whatever utility payments are due within that. Nothing more can be done, but it will prevent a lot of people abandoning houses, which does happen under the voluntary Rent Deduction Scheme. People can sign up and get into community housing and then, a month later, or two months later, go along and sign out of the scheme at Centrelink but the landlord is the last person to hear about it. Some tenancies are abandoned with damage to the properties as well. Again, most people respect the benefit and the support that they receive from the Australian taxpayer but there's always one portion, no matter what scheme you haveâbut, in this case, it's rental supportâthat abuses the system. These changes will mean that is removed as a possibility, because the funds will be deducted automatically. I do stand in support of this because it is practical and it's a real issue for many people that they aren't able to manage their rental obligations. This will be a way of protecting them from some of their not necessarily consciously delinquent behaviour but the behaviour that ends up with them being in arrears and being forced out of their accommodation or just abandoning it. I commend these bills and the amendment to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:33</span>):  I'm speaking in support of the amendment that's been moved by the member for Barton and shadow minister for social services. The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017 extends the voluntary Rent Deduction Scheme to be mandatorily applied to all tenants receiving social security or family assistance payments who live in public or community housing. That's the first element of the bill. The second element of the bill refers to the National Rental Affordability Scheme and providing a bit more clarification about the term 'below market rent' and also some flexibility in respect of vacancy periodsâbroadly, principles that Labor supports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bill that, however, doesn't really address some of the key issues of housing affordability and homelessness in Australia. Once again, given the opportunity, this government have missed the mark when it comes to providing a real response to some of these key issues that are seeing, unfortunately, a large number of Australians sleeping rough throughout the country. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government has had over five years to develop some meaningful reform in this area, but they've really given up on governing and they've slashed the original cap of 50,000 dwellings in the National Rental Affordability Scheme to 38,000. Despite serious housing stress and a lack of affordable housing options in Australia, they've failed to restore Labor's original cap and failed to deliver an extension of the NRAS. They've done nothing to meaningfully address issues of housing affordability, they've done nothing on homelessness, they've taken very little action to improve mental health services and mental health outcomes, they've given no assistance for additional housing for women leaving situations of domestic violence and they've given no help to vulnerable Australians to access more affordable housing options. Any member in this place will tell you about the massive waiting lists that exist for public and community housing in this country at the moment. In the area that I represent, people can wait up to eight years to get and access public or community housing. That's simply too long. For a wealthy, developed nation like Australia to treat people in that circumstance when they're at their most vulnerable is unacceptable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Changes to the treatment of tax concessions for property investors and genuine investment in social housing are needed to address the cost of housing for everyday Australians. But, like many things with this government, it's all been too hard, particularly given how focused they've been on their internal shortcomings over recent years. We've seen this before from this government. Vested interests get in place and lobby the government to ensure that they don't take real action to deal with some of the issues around housing affordability. Most notably, the very generous and in some cases the largest tax concessions in the world that exist for investors in property in this country have had an effect on the housing market and have distorted affordability outcomes, particularly in the big capital cities. I'm referring, of course, to the government's continued support for the massive tax concessions that exist around negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts on the sale of investment properties in this country. It appears that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are more interested in ensuring that there is a tax concession for someone that is seeking to negatively gear their ninth or 10th investment property rather than in providing support for first home buyers or people who are looking to get into public housing or, indeed, providing more public housing to ensure that those waiting lists reduce. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen only this week that again the government are on with their scare campaign about negative gearing, relying on a report prepared by the Master Builders that is completely wrong. It appears they didn't even read Labor's policy around negative gearing, because the policy grandfathers anyone that's currently in the system and ensures that the reforms to negative gearing only apply prospectively to those who are seeking to negative gear beyond a certain date and allows negative gearing to continue just so long as it is in respect of off-the-plan developments and new housing. The philosophy there is that it will grow the housing stock, that it will generate jobs in the important housing industry and increase the stock, thereby taking pressure off house prices and pressure off rents. Many of the people who are the subject of this bill today are in the situation they're in because they can't afford to buy a house and they certainly can't afford to rent a house given the exorbitant house prices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, when it comes to rental affordability, those opposite have hobbled the National Rental Affordability Scheme with a cap of 38,000 dwellings. That's a reduction on the cap that Labor had put in place when we were in government, trying to improve affordability for people in rental markets throughout the country. This decision has been widely criticised by housing sector stakeholders, including the Property Council of Australia. It was the Property Council that backed reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts as well. These much-needed changes to CGT and negative gearing are key measures to help holistically address the growing social and economic inequalities that contribute to housing affordability issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government is at odds with an ever-increasing list of organisations and individuals arguing for reform of negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions in this country. They include the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, the government's own financial systems inquiry, the Grattan Institute, ACOSS, the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, and the Australian Institute of Company Directors. All of these organisations have been calling for some years for reform to negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts because of the distortions in the housing market that they produce and the effects that they have on housing affordability that lead to situations like the one that we're debating here, with people being unable to afford a house in the normal rental market and pressure being put on the public housing system, leading to some of the consequences that are dealt with in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Winding back tax concessions like CGT and tax discounts is a more equitable and efficient way of raising revenue, but it also deals with some of the distortions that I mentioned earlier. Labor's housing affordability policies have been specifically designed to provide that affordability elementâto take pressure off rental markets but also to stimulate new housing supply by continuing to allow negative gearing arrangements for investments in new housing stock whilst protecting existing investments. Only Labor is committed to tracking and tackling housing affordability issues that grip the nation. In many respects, it is the No. 1 issue for household budgets throughout the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's always said that the vast majority of income support recipients are more than capable of managing their own finances. This bill does go to those types of issues: how far you should seek to intervene in people's own affairs and the managing of their finances, particularly those who are public housing tenants and their ability to pay their rent on time. In the case of rent, we know that most social housing residents are excellent tenants and prioritise their rental payments. It's a fact that the rate for public housing and social housing in the last five years, to 2015-16, was over 99 per cent. In those five years leading up to 2015-16, for 99 per cent of the time public housing and social housing tenants paid their rent. That's why the government's proposed scheme in this bill is a disproportionate response. There's not really a big issue for many public housing tenants when it comes to paying rent on time and paying rent in full. Although the number of evictions of social housing tenants is only a small proportion, abandonment of the premises also occurs and homelessness is a result of both. What the studies find is that, in a lot of cases, when it comes to homelessness with respect to public housing, mental health issues, drug addiction and other health issues are bigger factors than paying rent on time. However, the automatic rent deduction scheme, in its current form, risks tenants being forced into serious financial hardship. This is an issue that's been identified by the Senate committee that looked into the bill. In their inquiry into this element of the bill, they found that there wasn't really an issue. Although we all want to ensure that people aren't forced into situations of homelessness, this bill could go too far by intervening into the affairs of those who are receiving social security payments in the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a principle in social security, and that is the inalienable nature of the payment to the recipient of the payment. In other words, the payment that's provided to someone who's on a pension, including a disability support pension, or is receiving other Centrelink benefits or is on Newstart, should go directly to them and shouldn't go to third parties. That principle has been whittled down over some years by things like the intervention in the Northern Territory, cashless welfare cards and the like. Labor's philosophy is that this should occur only in extreme circumstances and, given those particular factors about the rates of nonpayment and the rates of late payment of rent in public housing, we don't really see the need for drastic measures such as this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In respect of the bill, generally, there are some good elements related to clarifying definitions regarding the National Rental Affordability Scheme. However, I reiterate the point that I made earlierâthat some elements of this bill go too far. Once again, the government isn't really dealing with the issue at the heart of some of these measuresâand that is the fact that rental and housing affordability in Australia is at incredibly unaffordable levels. It's been identified that the massive tax concessions that exist around housing for investors in this country are driving a lot of that unaffordability. Unless you are dealing with those tax concessionsânegative gearing and capital gains tax discountsâyou are not fair dinkum about housing affordability in this country. Only the Labor Party have that set of fair dinkum policies to really improve affordability and ensure that ultimately we reduce the amount of homelessness in this country and ensure that everyone in Australia has the opportunity of that great principle, that human right, of a roof over their head.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CREWTHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  The provision of shelter for any human being and their families, whether in Australia or around the world, is a vital part of people being in control of their lives. It brings safety and a sense of belonging. While the provision of housing is very much a state government matter, it is important that we as a federal government do everything we can to put downward pressure on housing affordability and to ensure that this is possible. The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017 will help low-income earners avoid the rental arrears spiral. The government's amendments in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill will make changes to, firstly, the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme and, secondly, the National Rental Affordability Scheme to address issues raised through the Senate committee inquiry and with the states and territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme will enable rent and utilities to be deducted from welfare payments for occupants living in social housing. There has been an extensive consultation process with state and territory governments and the social housing sector. The committee's inquiry into the bill received 32 submissions and heard from eight witnesses as part of the public hearing. The Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme will be limited to rent and utilities only. Arrears incurred due to suspension of an income support payment will not be deducted from a single payment when the payment recommences. Ministers from participating jurisdictions will write to the Minister for Families and Social Services outlining the social housing policies in each state and territory. Welfare recipients will have their social housing deductions paid directly to their social housing provider and then receive the remainder of their social security or family assistance payments. Welfare recipients will not be able to change or cancel the deductions without the social housing provider's knowledge, which they are able to be do under the current voluntary rent deduction scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been concerns from all levels of government and the community about evictions from social housing due to rental arrears, which can result in homelessness. These changes will help prevent arrears and reduce evictions and property abandonments from social housing in a managed and affordable way. Importantly, it will also help to reduce the incidences of people going into a situation of homelessness. We have seen the impact of homelessness for people not only in my community but across Victoria, where I'm based, and across Australia. Where people fall out of the system, they often end up in a situation of moving from house to house and in other situations can end up on the street as well. We have many organisations in my electorate, such as the Seaford Housing Action Coalition and Community Support Frankston, providing the necessary support to people who may be homeless and may be in need. In particular, it is important through this bill and the actions we are taking to prevent these situations arising in the first place. While a cure is very importantâand I've worked locally to re-secure a homeless meals service back in Frankston as well as to secure funding recently for a local hot shower for those who are homeless and those who are in needâit is important that we take further action, such as via this bill, to prevent those situations arising in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going further around the content of this amendment bill: social housing lessors in participating states and territories can choose to use the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme. However, they will be required to submit individual requests for each tenant they intend to use the scheme with. Tenants will only be subject to the scheme when they have entered into an agreement with a lessor authorising such deductions. State and territories estimate that the social housing system is losing more than $30 million each year in unpaid rent and administrative costs. This places an unnecessary and additional burden on the already financially strained social housing system. The Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme will work alongside government funded financial counselling and other financial support services to ensure welfare recipients continue to be housed safely and affordably whilst sustaining their tenancy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government amendments to the bill also allow the National Rental Affordability Scheme regulations to empower the secretary of the Department of Social Services to grant dispensation from the '20 per cent less than market rent' rule where a particular charge for rent is higher than the maximum permissible through inadvertence and the tenant has been compensated for the mistake. The department has consulted with National Rental Affordability Scheme stakeholders to identify ways to improve the administration of this system and reduce the regulatory burden on approved participants. Over 30 submissions were received, with a range of suggestions on how the legislative framework for the National Rental Affordability Scheme could be streamlined to support the efficient and effective administration of the system going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The object of this system is to encourage large-scale investment in housing so as to increase the supply of affordable rental dwellings and reduce rental costs for low- and moderate-income households. To accomplish this, the National Rental Affordability Scheme provides approved participants with a financial incentive for a period of 10 years to rent dwellings to eligible tenantsâlow- to middle-income earnersâat a rate of at least 20 per cent below the market rate. The National Rental Affordability Scheme Act requires the regulations under it to prescribe that the rent charged for an approved rental dwelling must be at least 20 per cent less than the market rent at all times during the year. The term 'at all times during the year' has been subject to conflicting interpretations over the years. This bill removes the prescriptive nature of the current vacancy provisions to allow greater flexibility for the National Rental Affordability Scheme regulations to prescribe permitted vacancy periods. The bill also inserts provisions into the National Rental Affordability Scheme Act to provide express legislative authority for the regulations to vary conditions of allocation and to put it beyond doubt that conditions may be varied or imposed after an allocation has been made. These provisions will reduce the risk to the Commonwealth when varying or imposing new conditions on existing allocations to address emerging risks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ability to substitute dwellings is crucial to achieving the National Rental Affordability Scheme's objective of increasing the supply of affordable rental dwellings. I am pleased that the Minister for Social Services, the cabinet and others within our governmentâand I know that this issue is supported across the chamber as wellâhave worked together to ensure that we are taking action with respect to housing affordability. This bill will help people to avoid homelessness to begin with. I continue to work in my electorate to advocate for people who are homeless and those who are in need. We must take a preventive approach to this, not just an approach once people are already in that situation. Let's continue to work together, along with the states and territories across Australia, to not only further improve the social housing stock across Australia but to also take action to assist those who are in need to avoid homelessness in the first place.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:54</span>):  Close to 120,000 Australians have no home. A disproportionate number of them are young, but one of the most rapidly growing groups without housing or shelter are older Australians. It says a lot about the priorities and the general level of paralysis within this government that we're only today finally getting the chance to debate the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017. It was first introduced on 14 September 2017. It was intended to give effect to elements of the government's housing statement that was contained in the May 2017 budget. If nothing else, the bill is a stark reminder to us all that homelessness has not somehow gone away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also reminds us that this government continues to avoid the big issues in housing. Like many of its policies in other areas, it is reactionary, it is a punishment and it is fails to protect the needs of those who are the most vulnerable. Rental stress, out-of-reach house prices and the simple problem of finding somewhere to live that is close to work are not far from the minds of many, if not most, Australians. You'd be forgiven for thinking that, because house prices in Sydney and Melbourne appear to have topped out for the time being, this government seems to think that it's a case of game over and problem solved. If it truly believes that, it is delusional.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the outset, I wish to thank the member for Jagajaga and her staff for the generous help and support they've always provided to those of us who cannot claim to have anything like her understanding of these matters. Let me also take the opportunity to thank her too for the enormous contribution that she has made in this place since 1996 to reforming public policy over what has been a long and distinguished time in public life. I'd also like to thank Senator Doug Cameron from New South Wales for his long and ongoing interest in the provision of housing for those who are the most vulnerable and thank him for his ongoing efforts and support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the years since this bill was presented, we have yet further evidence that the housing market and housing policy continue to fail so many of our citizens in so many ways. Those failings are captured in two excellent reports that together show that current policies are not delivering an adequate supply of housing for the underprivileged, for renters or even for first home buyers. The first of those is the ninth in the annual series of reports on rental affordability that are prepared by Anglicare, <span style="font-style:italic;">Rental affordability snapshot</span><span style="font-style:italic;">2018</span>. The second is the Grattan Institute's March 2018 study, <span style="font-style:italic;">Housing affordability: re-imagining the Australian dream</span>. Both are compulsory reading for anyone who is seriously interested in the issues that are before us today. Each, in its own way, exposes the degree to which a reordering of government priorities and a reallocation of public funding is needed to address housing affordability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Taken together, these two reports show governments don't need to spend more; they just need to direct funding to where it will do the most good. Governments need to pare back the tens of billions spent annually on unproductive tax concessions, such as negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts, and redirect a portion of those funds to those who are in real need. At the same time, governments must address the stop-go pattern in housing starts that damages confidence in the housing sector and perpetuate chronic areas of undersupply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to get its priorities right. Anglicare is one of Australia's most respected and highly credentialed peak charitable bodies. The ninth in its series of rental affordability snapshots follows the pattern of previous reports, showing that low-income earners have little or no chance of buying their own home and are effectively excluded from the private rental market. In its April 2016 report, Anglicare surveyed the rental market and found that, with the over 75,000 rental properties that were then available across Australia, only 21 properties were affordable for single adults living on Newstart and only one was suitable for young people living on youth allowance. They found that despite the high level of pensions compared to the allowances, affordable rentals were extremely limited for a single person living on any government payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anglicare's April 2017 report showed a dire shortage of affordable rental houses for people on low incomes. Nationally, only six per cent of over 67,000 dwellings that were surveyed were suitable for any of the 10 selected households in receipt of government benefits. The 2018 report shows the position has continued to slide and has been further exacerbated by the loss of some lower cost properties to Airbnb. The report makes it plain too that rents in many regional areas are not that much lower than those in the capital cities. So, even where work is available, those on low or even average incomes will struggle to find affordable housing anywhere in Australia. None of this should be a surprise, nor should we expect any significant improvement in Anglicare's 2019 report, notwithstanding the myriad of bandaid measures in the Treasurer's 2017 budget, many of which were recycled in this year's budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Private rents in the last year in most markets moved up by around 2.7 per cent, enough to outstrip wage increases and the CPI. Over the decade to April 2017, the minimum wage rose 31 per cent and inflation went up 27 per cent but rents soared by 48 per cent. Government payments such as Newstart and youth allowance have fallen in real terms since the mid to late 1990s, which is shameful. Affordability issues and supply shortages at the lower end of the housing market are now deeply ingrained in the system. In the then Treasurer's 2017 budget, he claimed that there are no silver bullets to make housing more affordable but, by adopting a comprehensive approach by working together, we can make a difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having listed a couple of worthwhile and not-so-worthwhile initiatives, the Treasurer concluded his budget announcements on housing by claiming that the measures he outlined represented a comprehensive package that can make a difference. The trouble is, of course, that the then Treasurer's proposals do precious little to directly address the biggest problem with housing affordability in our biggest housing markets. There are disastrous effects of negative gearing and capital gains concessions on house prices, housing affordability and household indebtedness. That's not to mention the billions of dollars that the federal budget haemorrhages every year to underpin the entire madness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compounding the then Treasurer's credibility problem, he spent the last year and a half wrongly claiming that a rationalisation on negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions would ramp up rents and take a chainsaw approach to the housing market. He's even continued down that track whilst knowing full well that such rhetoric is totally at odds with the thinking of most independent commentators and the advice of his own department. The trouble with his two massive tax concessions is not just that they force up house prices and corrupt the housing market but that they also punch a huge hole in the federal budget. Such a hole, in fact, that there is little left over to help those locked out of home ownership and the private rental market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2016, the respected Grattan Institute estimated that capital gains and negative gearing concessions were actually contributing to higher taxes on all Australians. To quote their media release:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Long overdue changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax would save the Commonwealth Government about $5.3 billion a year</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their 2018 study merely amplifies these criticisms, concluding that present policy has not delivered the volume and type of housing we need to meet demand, given our current rate of population growth. It's still my favourite statistic on the budget looting effects that these two overblown tax concessions caused that in 1998-99, the year that capital gains tax discounts and negative gearing were joined, there were 1.3 million tax-paying landlords, making a collective return of $700 billion in tax to the government. By 2010-11, all up there were 1.8 million landlords, making a combined tax loss of $7.8 billion. That should shock those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The odds are it's a whole lot worse now. In the early 1990s, investor demand accounted for about 16 per cent of home loans. After dipping during the GFC, it climbed to a total of 55 per cent of total home loans before APRA controls were tightened in 2015. APRA controls have tightened again and again, and the investment share of housing demand has dropped. The government seems confident that that has fixed the housing-demand problem, and I'm not too sure about that, because investors still make up the majority of homebuyers. In any event, the drain that negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions impose on the federal budget remains a cancer on the system.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As The Salvation Army pointed out in its submission to the community services committee's inquiry into this bill, if just a part of the excessive and unnecessary tax expenditures on negative gearing and capital gains tax were put into providing more affordable housing, the country would be a whole lot better off. We could easily double the $1.7 billion that the government annually spends on public and social housing if a fraction of the money he offered up in unproductive tax concessions was redirected to those most in need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sharpest decline in homeownership, according to the Melbourne Institute, since 2002 has been among couples with dependent childrenâso the families that I care for. In 2002, 55 per cent of individuals in this family type were homeowners but, by 2014, it had slid to 38 per cent. A similar fall in homeownership in the 18- to 39-year-old group saw ownership rates down from 36 per cent in 2002 to 25 per cent in 2014. First home owner grants offered by state and territory governments have become less favoured and arguably less popular form of housing assistance. New dwellings financed by first home buyer schemes decreased from 29 per cent of the market in 2009 to 13 per cent in 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last four years, the size of the average mortgage rose by $70,000 or about 19 per cent. Home loan affordability is at its 2015 peak but loan repayments are still above the notional stress level of 30 per cent of family income. From 2011 to 2016 average rents across the country rose from $285 a week to $335 a week, or about 17 per cent. Over the same period, the CPI rose by about 10 per cent. Private debt levels partly driven by housing costs are at an all-time high and the second highest as a percentage of income in the world. Once interest rates start to rise there will be a significant increase in debt and rent stress, particularly if wages don't start to rise too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For its part, the Commonwealth has devoted a disproportionate level of budget support to underpin spending on investment properties. At the lower end of the income scale, the Commonwealth provides around $4.5 billion a year to 1.35 million low-and moderate-income households in the form of Commonwealth rent assistance. But, even after Commonwealth rent assistance is taken into account, about 40 per cent of those receiving this form of help experience rental stressâthat is, they are paying more than 30 per cent of their weekly income in rent. I'd also add that, by propping up the rental market instead of providing affordable housing, we're putting further stress on families because they have no permanency of dwelling and they have to move, often causing their children to have to move school and creating more and more stress for already stressed families. Our national stock of public housing has fallen in recent years, and this has only been partially offset by a rise in community housing. Together, they are insufficient to meet demand, and around 190,000 applicants are on waiting lists for social housing around Australiaâand climbing every week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the Rudd government's reforms in 2009, the federal government has provided significant support through the states and territories to help those on low incomes and the homeless via the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement. The current government has pledged to retain NHHA funding to around $1.3 billion per annum until the scheme is replaced. It says that funding will be maintained at or around the current levels, which is good but it needs to increase. As part of its 2017-18 budget proposals the Commonwealth announced it will provide an additional $375 million over three years from 2018 on. So it's not that the government is doing nothing; it is that it is not doing enough. The real question is: are its priorities right? I would say no.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Commentators, such as the highly respected Ross Gittins, have said that the government is adopting a punishment model of social welfare. Most other commentators agree. On numerous occasions, as I read through various briefs, speeches and commentaries on the ARDS, I keep encountering statements to the effect that rental arrears are not a massive issue. To quote from a recent <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Over the five years from 2011-12 to 2015-16 national rent collection rates have averaged 99.4 per cent for public housing, 99.2 per cent for community housing and 99.2 per cent for state owned and managed Indigenous housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, really, a tiny number of rental arrears. The rate of evictions is also extremely low, less than one per thousand tenants per year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor bill on housing contained none of the nasties that this government has introduced, and even some Liberal senators have identified them as being punitive. To quote Ross Gittins when speaking about the government on this issue:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="DZW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:09</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017. The fact is the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments have consistently failed to take meaningful action to tackle Australia's housing affordability crisis. It is indeed a major crisis that the nation faces. It's very much a crisis in regional areas like mine, the North Coast of New South Wales, where we see housing affordability as a major issue, particularly with prices and rents increasing. The waiting list for public housing in my region now extends for more than 20 years. All we have is inaction from both the federal government and indeed the New South Wales state government. In regions like mine, we blame the National Party for this massive inaction. I often say in this House that National Party choices hurt. When it comes to their inaction on housing affordability, that certainly is an area where National Party choices really do hurt people living in the regions and rural areas. In contrast, we in Labor have always been committed to tackling the issue of housing affordability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Addressing homelessness also means addressing the broader issues that can lead to homelessnessâfor example, taking effective action to improve matters like mental health services or providing assistance for women fleeing domestic violence and ensuring vulnerable Australians have affordable housing options. This bill instead imposes an automatic rent reduction scheme on social housing tenants. Make no mistake: it's not a serious attempt to address housing affordability. Homelessness is a very serious issue. We have an obligation to prevent it at every possible opportunity. That's why the former Labor government tried to introduce a rent deduction scheme. At the time, the Liberals opposed that particular scheme and also at the time, their shadow minister, the member for Menzies, claimed it would increase housing stress and financial hardship, yet now, in this bill, what they have introduced is a scheme that is much harsher than the voluntary one that Labor had initially proposed. Labor's scheme would have applied only to people who were in arrears and at risk of homelessness. The bill before us today would apply to everyone. This includes pensioners, people on disability support pensions and those on carers payments. People who have been responsibly paying their rent for years and in fact decades will all be caught up. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is based on legislation introduced by the Labor government in 2013, but this government's changes go way too far and are essentially unfair. We know the majority of social housing tenants manage their budgets well and pay their rent on time. This bill worryingly extends the existing rent deduction scheme so that it can be applied more broadly by the states and territories. It also allows community housing providers to automatically withhold a portion of the tenant's income support and/or family tax benefit payment and use these funds to directly pay rent and utility costs on behalf of those tenants. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the original legislation under Labor, however, the rent deduction scheme was voluntary and applied only if requested by the tenants or if the tenant was in arrears. Under current rules, amounts deducted vary according to changes in rental and utility amounts. The tenant is always notified. But these new proposals do not require that the tenant actually be notified. This bill provides permission for the deductions of amounts related to the loss of or damage to property, and there are grave concerns this will particularly negatively impact victims of domestic and family violence. In fact, many of these differences could severely and negatively impact all tenants of public and community housing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently it's common practice for social housing tenants to negotiate with their housing provider to defer a rental payment in order to meet an emergency paymentâfor example, replacing an appliance or when they have a large bill. These are instances that regularly occur. But these proposed changes will potentially reduce the capacity of tenants to meet these unexpected expenses. We know this will lead to increasing stress and cause disempowerment amongst those tenants. It is a very harsh, punitive measure that the government is looking to introduce. There is also quite limited detail in the bill. We have no idea how payments will be deducted and how it will be tracked. There is also concern that in situations, for example, where you have several adults sharing the rent, only the person named on the lease will be liable for these deductions, and that means they're unfairly financially targeted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about much more than the unfair increase and stringency regarding rental deductions for people in community housing. It highlights an ever-present and sadly increasing issue all over Australia and, indeed, as I'd like to speak about, in my electorate of Richmond, in the Far North Coast of New South Wales. That issue is housing affordability and the rising rate of homelessness. The fact is that, in more than five years under this very chaotic and divided Liberal-National government, nothing has actually been done to effectively address the issue of housing affordability. This has then led to a greater need for more social and community housing. So the problem has gotten worse because of the five years of inaction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Worse still, on top of all that, the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments have cut important funding and services that sought to address homelessness, so the problem has been exacerbated. Whilst we may have seen various thought bubbles from the government on the issues surrounding housing affordability, they haven't acted on it or effectively done anything to address it. In my area and around the country, housing affordability is one of the most talked about issues of concern, and this government has indeed failed the Australian people by failing to take any meaningful action to tackle it. Adopting more punitive measures in the form of rent deduction, taking away even more of people's ability to manage their finances, will do nothing to address the larger issue of housing affordability, which, as I've said, this government refuses even to properly acknowledge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at the statistics, we see this is a problem in many areas around the country. I would like to highlight that there are parts of my electorate of Richmond that are listed, often, as some of the least affordable in the world. That, of course, is because of the massive disparity between house prices and wages. It is a major issue and one that is raised constantly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should point out that the former Prime Minister started 2017 by promising:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There will be a lot more to come on housing in the course of this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost two years ago the government announced task forces and models, and all of those things have come to nothing. The government said that this was a multifaceted issue. Very insultingly, of course, the former Prime Minister, we all recall, even suggested Australians should just buy their children a home. That was the former Prime Minister's way to tackle the issue. Of course, it shows just how out of touch the government is that they think that would be the answer. This also is a government that told the Australian people: get a better job, leave the city you're in or get rich parents. That's the answer of those opposite to these really complex, multifaceted problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as not addressing the housing issue, the government is putting more pressure on middle- and low-income earners. There is a long list of actions by this government that have led to the pressure that many families and individuals face. One of those things is, for example, failing to protect penalty rates and pushing for further cuts to penalty rates, lowering people's incomes. So they have their incomes going down as well as having housing stress. We have seen the government vote, I think, eight times to cut penalty rates. There were all those National Party members voting to cut penalty rates. We have also seen the government cut family support payments and target vulnerable Australians with their robo-debt program. We've had all these things put in place whilst we have a housing affordability crisis, culminating in difficult and challenging circumstances for many individuals and families across the nation. Those opposite simply refuse to acknowledge that homelessness and housing stress are both a symptom and a cause of poverty and disadvantage, factors which have been exacerbated at the hands of a cruel and uncaring government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016 the International Monetary Fund made clear that Australia has one of the fastest rising income inequality rates. Their prediction in 2018 was just as dire, with a review of Australia's economy being much less favourable than the government portrayed it. Housing affordability was a major factor in this, so the government cannot continue to ignore this massive problem in front of them. While the government is walking away from social and affordable housing, there is also more competition for rentals, which in turn is pushing prices up and pushing more people into short-term accommodation and homelessness. The cycle of disadvantage continues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are issues that we on this side of the House have consistently raised and called on the government to act on. Today, again, we are raising them and calling on the government to act. But, instead, the government just talk about themselves and their chaos and disunity. This is particularly highlighted by the National Party. We've just seen them talking amongst themselves about who's going to be leading them. There's been lots of infighting. They're focused only on themselves. I represent a regional area. I want to talk about the regional and rural areas of Australia. The National Party refuse to fight for them, refuse to stand up for them. They just talk about themselves, while at the same time we have really serious issues, like the lack of access to affordable housing in our regions. It is a serious, desperate and urgent matter, yet all they do is talk about themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other hand, Labor has a strong history of acting on this issue. Indeed, under the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments, we took major action when it came to this area. We built more houses and oversaw the biggest increase in housing stock. We had the National Rental Affordability Scheme, under which an additional 36,000 homes were built. That had benefits for regions like mine, northern New South Wales. It made a major difference for people to actually be able to access affordable housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This program, in total, would have provided 50,000 homes right across the country. Unfortunately, the government then capped and slashed this program when it was elected. It was very unfortunate because it was a program that made a huge difference. In contrast to the government's cuts, a Shorten Labor government has a plan to address a whole range of housing issues. We've talked about developing and implementing a national plan to reduce homelessness. It is so important to have that on the federal government's agenda. We've talked about reinstating a minister for housing and homelessness and re-establishing the National Housing Supply Council. We have, very importantly and consistently, for a long period of time talked about our important reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions and how important it is to have that on the agenda. Areas like mine have responded very positively to those particular reforms. They will make a major and very important difference. As part of our policy, we've also talked about the need to double the fees and penalties on foreign investment rules to help put first home buyers on a more level playing field with investors. Across the whole scheme, when it comes to housing affordability and homelessness, Labor has really listened and worked with the community to develop a whole series of proposals to address these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Very importantly we'll also address the gendered components of homelessness. On the night of the 2016 census, 6,866 older women were experiencing homelessnessâthat's a huge numberâand over 180,000 were renting. That is a major number to keep in mind. When the statistics are released, we see that older women are often at greater risk of homelessness and the rates of older women experiencing homelessness are not only growing but rapidly accelerating. Labor will provide $88 million over two years for a new safe housing fund to increase transitional housing options for women and children fleeing domestic and family violence, young people exiting out of home care and older women on low incomes who are at risk of homelessness. That's because we understand that it's important to have that intervention when people are at that extreme risk of homelessness. We have to have those policies right across the board to make sure we can effectively provide that support to people who are at risk of homelessness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are, in many areas, great individuals and groups that do a lot to assist people. In my community, there is a whole variety of groups, but there is one I would like to highlight: Mr John Lee, the founder and president of a homes outreach provider called You Have a Friend. I have spoken about John Lee before. I'd like to mention him because it is important. His organisation supports more than 300 people throughout my electorate. It supports people who are homeless, facing homelessness or are, indeed, marginalised. You Have a Friend supports these people by, very importantly, providing meals and friendship as well. John Lee has been providing this service for many years and doesn't receive any government support. For eight years, he has been effectively campaigning for a homeless shelter in Tweed. I commend his advocacy in this particular area. He's been ignored by the state government and ignored by the Nationals member for Tweed Geoff Provest, who lied when he falsely promised to deliver a homelessness shelter. He actually stated that to the community. Because of claims like that and many other reasons, our community distrusts the National Party. Also, for years, Geoff Provest and the National Party have failed to address the growing need in our area when it comes to homelessness and providing shelters. Mr John Lee's also fought for increased housing supply throughout our area and, in particular, the Tiny Homes project. He feels strongly about that, as we do in Labor. I would certainly like to commend John Lee again because it is important that people who work hard like himâand there are many services throughout the North Coast and Northern Rivers who do a great jobâcontinue to get the support of our local community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We look to our regions and our rural areas and what do we see? In my area we see a federal government and a New South Wales state government that have done nothing when it comes to addressing homelessness. Their inaction is overwhelming. Whilst they are not acting, the crisis is continuing and it's exasperating all the time. It is a major concern. I have continuously condemned the National Party for their inaction. There are many reasons for which the National Party have abandoned the people of the regions and of rural Australia, but this issue is major. It is a really big crisis right across the board and it's one that I'll continue to criticise them for. It's only a Labor government that will actually take that action. A Shorten Labor government will put tackling homelessness and housing affordability back on the national agenda. It should be on the national agenda. There should be a comprehensive approach right across the board to address all of these issues because the situation is so dire. We certainly have a strong history of doing that when we were in government before. This government has failed to act, and it is now an absolute crisis, but a Shorten Labor government will address these all of these issues when it comes to tackling homelessness and housing affordability.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  I rise to speak to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017. It's a narrow and technical bill which addresses a small part of a huge national problem: housing affordability and homelessness in Australia. The extent of the problem is massive. It is in fact a national disgrace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're all conscious of the visible face of homelessness, people sleeping rough out of doors, whether it be in the south, in the cities, in winter, freezing cold, or whether it be where I'm from, in the north of Australia, living rough on the streets or in the long grass. The problem is much deeper than the visible face of homelessness in our cities, as bad as that is. There are many, many thousands of people living in insecure and temporary overcrowded accommodationâhundreds of thousandsâin boarding houses, in backyards, in tents and in caravans and sleeping on friends' couches. It's a problem that disproportionately affects women and children. Often they are fleeing violent partners or dangerous households. Women's refuges are often full, having to turn people away. According to the recent <span style="font-style:italic;">State of homelessness in Australia's cities</span> report, one in 20 homeless people may be a veteran. That is part of this national disgrace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On any night, one in 200 Australians is homeless. That would be a figure that would shock a lot of Australians, and it should. They might be asking themselves: how has this happened? How can it be that, in this lucky country, we've got so many people in such a desperate situation, when we're one of the richest countries in the world? I know that many people, seeing the visible homeless in our streets, are overcome by a sense of hopelessness. They often walk past those homeless people with averted eyes, not wanting to look into the eyes of those without a home, often those who have mental health problems that either resulted in them becoming homeless or have been exacerbated and brought on through their homelessness. I understand that many people go through that thought process of, 'Should I drop $2 into the cup on the pavement?' or, 'What good can $5 do here or there?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I guess it is an issue where we see very plainly that governments are important. This is an issue where governments have a responsibility to help those in need, to help those who are down on their luck, and Labor takes this responsibility very seriously. One of Labor's great leaders and great prime ministers, Ben Chifley, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have a great objective - the light on the hill - which we aim to reach by working the betterment of mankind not only here but anywhere we may give a helping hand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments can make things better, and governments should make things better. We in Labor believe that we are here to make things better for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing affordability and homelessness are serious issues, and they're a growing problem. As I've said, homelessness here in Australia is a national disgrace, and it is a problem that's got worse in recent times, during the period of the Abbott, Turnbull and now Morrison conservative governments. This is a problem that is getting worse. On census night 2016, nationally, there were 116,427 people homeless, up from 102,439 in 2011. My electorate of Solomon is in the Northern Territory, where the Bureau of Statistics counted 13,734 homeless people in 2016.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Much of the increase in homelessness between 2011 and 2016 was as a result of more people living in severely crowded dwellings. Homelessness is not just because there are not enough houses, of course. But severe overcrowding suggests there is a need for more housing that is affordable to low-income earners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has announced a range of policies to address the problem. Those opposite don't seem to have too many answers. They don't seem to have too many policies. Homelessness and housing affordability don't seem to be a priority for them. I guess it's difficult to understand the problem while enjoying the view from somewhere in northern Sydney overlooking the harbour, but I encourage those oppositeâperhaps we need an envoy for homelessness; perhaps we need someone to go out there into the regions of Australia or even just to go out onto city streets to see how desperate this situation has become.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're all very familiar with rapidly rising house prices in our largest cities. Million-dollar houses are now commonplace in many of our suburbs, and owning a house has become something of an impossible dream for many of our young people. But what's less obvious is that these rising prices at the top end of the market cascade down to lower-priced houses and apartments for sale and rent. This means that even the cheapest accommodation becomes too expensive for people on low incomes. Housing prices have moderated somewhat in recent months, but lower sale prices will still afford little or no relief to low-income renters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So to this bill. It has good intentions. As far as it goes, which is not very far, it should be supported. But I do have concerns with it. To summarise: the bill sets up an Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme which would allow deduction of rent from the income support payments and family tax benefit payments of all social housing tenants. The bill requires rent under the National Rental Affordability Scheme to be at least 20 per cent under market-value rent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first question that comes to mind about these provisions is: why are they necessary? In his second reading speech, the then Minister for Social Services, Mr Porter, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill will implement an Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme to help reduce homelessness for social housing tenants who are in serious rental arrears that could, and in many cases does, lead to eviction or housing abandonment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not entirely convinced by this argument. When the bill was scrutinised in the Senate committee, Labor senators supported the intention of the bill to prevent homelessness, but thought the provisions were too broad, that there should be a cap on deductions and that the relationship of this bill to other forms of income management should be clarified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is it in fact the case that rental arrears are a significant cause of homelessness? We know that some 90 per cent of public and social housing tenants have no problems paying their rent. Almost all of those use current voluntary rent deduction schemes. While nonpayment of rent can be an issue, and is a problem for state and territory housing authorities, eviction and homelessness are often caused by more complex problems, as I've mentioned, such as mental illness, substance abuse, family violence and a lack of affordable alternative housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also concerned that a compulsory scheme, as proposed in this bill, will take away options and decision-making power from tenants. Often they have to make day-to-day or week-to-week decisions about pressing financial mattersâfor example, the fridge has died, the car rego is due or, for us in the Top End, there's been the disaster of your air-conditioner going on the blink in the build-up. But if a proportion of their income has been compulsorily committed, they have less flexibility to meet other pressing expenses. Currently, tenants can negotiate with their housing provider to defer a rental payment to meet other unexpected expenses. Taking decisions like this out of their hands makes it harder for them to take responsibility for their actions and learn how to manage their finances. If tenants are subject to other forms of income management or cashless debit cards, they may be left with only a very small portion of their income to spend at their own discretion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am aware that, during the Rudd-Gillard governments, there was legislation introduced for a compulsory rental deduction scheme in 2013, but that bill lapsed at the 2013 election. I'm also aware that some of the states, including some Labor states, support this legislation. Victoria and the ACT oppose it. I have firsthand experience of housing affordability and homelessness from my time with the St Vincent de Paul Society in the Northern Territory. In the Northern Territory, we have significant homelessness problems. One of the things I was pleased that we could do in that timeâand I still continue to work with Vinnies in a voluntary wayâwas establish some social housing in Coconut Grove so that we could assist particularly young familiesâwomen and children, in particularâin their time of need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Charities such as Vinnies today continue to visit people living in very difficult circumstances, making sure that they can continue to provide support to those people and hopefully prevent them from falling into homelessness as well as support the homeless on the streets with soup vans and the like. Charities, including Vinnies, who do great work helping people who are either, as I said, homeless or at the risk of homelessness is important. It is a good way for people to contribute and to do something themselves. But I believe it's the role of government to help those who are in need or are homeless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why Labor as the alternative government have developed and published our national plan to reduce homelessness. As the opposition, our role is to oppose the government, hold it to account and expose its short-comings, of which there are many. Importantly, we also put ourselves forward to the citizens of Australia as the alternative government with policies to address the issues now facing all Australians. Homelessness is clearly a national problem. It's a national disgrace, and a Shorten Labor government will implement a national plan to reduce homelessness in cooperation with the states and territories. This will be a long-term plan, as it needs to be, and it will address homelessness and the issues that contribute to itâmental health, trauma and substance abuse, as I've mentioned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a massive gap in housing policy. A Labor government will provide national leadership on housing affordability and reducing homelessness. Labor took to the 2016 election a policy to halve homelessness by 2025. The particular focus for our homelessness policy will be to support women and children escaping family violence being forced out of their homes and into homelessness. Part of that will be providing $88 million for a safe housing fund to provide transitional housing for women and children escaping that family violence, for young people leaving out-of-home care and for older women on low incomes at risk of homelessness. So Labor has a clear plan for housing affordability, and some of the other contributions have talked about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time remaining, I just want to say that this bill will not solve the problem of homelessness in Australia. The only way we will be able to take effective action against homelessness and make housing more affordable is to elect a Shorten Labor government at the next election, because we know that this national disgrace of homelessness in the lucky country must end.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  Some of the most distressing and difficult calls to my office come from people who are struggling with housingâwhether they haven't got a place to live, whether they do and they're having problems with a landlord, or whether they're in public housing. I don't think it's hard to imagine how profound the concept of having a secure roof over your head is. Therefore, when it's at risk it is a very emotional and distressing situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know when I first learnt of Abraham Maslow and his hierarchy of needsâI suspect it was when I did my first psychology subject back in the eightiesâbut that has come to mind as I've been considering this piece of legislation. Obviously, if you look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs, shelter is primary. I suppose I'd be much happier if this bill were to consider a housing-first approach to homelessness or to ensure there is support for people to maintain their tenancy rather than the approach it's taking. People also have primary needs for food, for being able to cook their food, for being warm. Then not far above that is the need for security and safety. So these are really profound issues that we're dealing with. But people also need to be able to look after the needs they have that are unexpected. It might be that at certain times of the year their household costs are high, whether that's due to car registration or back-to-school costs. What I'm most concerned about in what's being proposed by the government here is the lack of flexibility for people who live in public housing or who have probably only their welfare support to get them through this particular period of their life, and they have very little buffer. This is taking away a layer of flexibility that, until now, people have had. So I'm very uncomfortable with what seems to be a disproportionate response to the problem as far as the automatic rent deduction component of this bill goes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should note there are two different aspects to this bill. I will certainly be supporting the changes to the National Rental Affordability Scheme, and I will speak a bit more about that later. I want to focus on the automatic rent deduction. Under the proposal, states and territories, as well as community housing providers, would be able to request that the secretary withhold a portion of a tenant's income support and/or family tax benefit payments and use these funds to directly pay rent and utilities costs on behalf of the tenants. The bill will allow automatic deductions for people in receipt of not just one category of government support but a wide range: the age pension, the disability support pension, carer payment, family tax benefit, Newstart and youth allowance. This means that funds could be withheld from tenants without their permission, without them granting any consent, if a state chooses to apply it that way. We may well see that this is rolled out differently in different states, which just introduces another layer of confusion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Maintaining a rental is important. Nobody questions that. But let's look at the actual problem that this legislation is supposed to address. The advice that I've seen from the Parliamentary Library shows that 343,000 households out of a total of 395,000 households in public or social housing, which is around 86 per cent, are already choosing to have voluntary rent deductions. Those are the 2015-16 figures. That's where people have absolutely stepped up and said, 'Yes, I would like it to come out directly.' That's a choice they've made. The other figure that we have here, which was presented to the Senate inquiry, shows that 90 per cent of tenants have no problem meeting their rental obligations. So you put those two things together and you wonder how big this problem is. The Parliamentary Library figures I've seen show that over the five years from 2011-12 to 2015-16âthat might actually be four financial yearsânational rent collection rates have over averaged 99 per cent across public housing, community housing, state-owned housing and managed Indigenous housing. We're now starting to see the size of the problem. We're really talking about one per cent, yet we've got a bill that means it could happen to 100 per cent of people under Centrelink.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor took a different approach to this. When we were in government, we introduced the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Public Housing Tenants' Support) Bill 2013. I think that actually shows what our intention was; it was to support tenancy, not the much-loved big stick approach that those opposite have. We did this on the recommendation from the housing and homelessness white paper, which was called <span style="font-style:italic;">The road home: a national approach to reducing homelessness</span>. I do think that we have an obligation, wherever possible, to prevent homelessness. That's because helping to maintain someone's tenancy is a way easier solution than helping them find a new place when they are homeless. Those are the principles that underlie it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We did look to introduce an automatic rent deduction scheme four years ago with very special provisions around it. I might add that it was opposed by the Liberals. They opposed it. At the time, their shadow minister, the member for Menzies, claimed that it would increase housing stress and financial hardship. Those were the grounds on which it was opposed. Yet the scheme that they're choosing to introduce now, a few years later, is much harsher than the one that we looked at. Our scheme would only have applied to people who were in arrears and at risk of homelessness. The bill before us today applies to everybody. Whether they agree or not, it apples to everybody.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our proposal also capped rental deductions to make sure that people weren't left without the ability to do some management of their own affairs or meet other commitments. This government bill doesn't place any limit on the amount of deductions, potentially leaving people with nothing to live on. There's nothing to protect people so that they can put some food on the table. If you combine it with the people on the cashless debit card trial, you can see how easy it would be for someone to end up with zero disposable income. You might say, 'Well, that's life. Those are the things that happen,' but what about treating people with respect and giving them some autonomy so that they can learn to manage their money?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also look at this and think, 'What about kids going back to school?' It is really expensive equipping kids to start the school year. It's expensive equipping them to start the winter part of the year. My children seem to grow out of their shoes very fast in a school year. You hold off until September and finally have to give out and buy them a new pair of school shoes. Of course, by the end of January, they will have well and truly grown out of those. These are the sort of costs that we are not giving people flexibility to move around. I've also had the example raised with me of a domestic violence incident, where someone needs to fix something that has been damaged. You're taking away the flexibility to do that. I heard the member for Solomon say that this seems like well-intentioned legislation. I don't think the consequences of this have actually been thought through for people in their homes day to day and week to week as they try to deal with this. Remember, it will depend on what the states decide to do. There are a lot of unknowns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we looked at this principle, it was a requirement under our scheme that tenants be communicated with before the amount withheld was changed. There is nothing in this bill to do that. There is nothing to say that there has to be communication with the tenant. This bill also allows an amount to be deducted to compensate landlords for property damage. If you think about some of the causes of property damage and you look at domestic violence and family violence, those can be the circumstances in which property damage occurs. Our bill limited the deductions to cover only amounts for rent and utilities so that people were protected from being forced to pay for damage that was caused by other people. They are some of the safety things that we looked at that are completely absent from this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are really concerned about the impact of this scheme as its proposed on tenantsâthat this is something that could genuinely push people into financial stress and poverty. We have always said that the vast majority of people receiving income support are more than capable of managing their own finances. In fact, it is ironic that this very issue came up a couple of days ago in this place during the payday lending debate that we had. I noted comments by the member for Mackellar, who made the point:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ there are people in this country who may be on low incomes, but they actually have a much better sense of how they spend their money than some of the bureaucrats in the Labor Party do. They don't need you to tell them how to do it. That's because, let me tell you, they're aware of what they're doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting to have a comment like that in one debate, yet have legislation like this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there was a misunderstanding about what we want to see with payday lending, which are protections to ensure that people are not exploited by dodgy payday lenders. But, ironically, this legislation will push people towards that sort of source of income if they find they have a problem that they need money to deal with, like a broken fridge, a washing machine or a tyre that's not going and they can't get to their job. I just think we need to bring some consistency. You can't really argue to treat people one way in one piece of legislation and then come up with something like this in another piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're seeing here is a problem that financial autonomy is only really respected when it's convenient. Let's remember that 90 per cent of tenants have no problem meeting their rental obligation and rent collection rates have averaged over 99 per cent across every sector. That's why I would argue that this is a really disproportionate response to what has been defined as a problem, but quite a small problem. I'm very uncomfortable with the continuing demonisation of people who, at a time in their life when things are really tough and they've turned to the government for help to get them through, are going to be hit by something like this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other aspect of this bill is the National Rental Affordability Scheme. In the time that I've got, I'd like to talk about housing affordability. So little has been done by this government on what is genuinely a big problem. There is not a day that goes by in my electorate where people don't talk to me about their inability to find an affordable rental property or, further down the track, their challenges in trying to find a home that they can call their own. I held an Older Women and Homelessness Forum. It isn't just young people who are talking to me about these issues. There are older women who are deeply concerned about their future when they stop work and as they retire, and some of these women were not far from that. Others have seen friends not able to find a secure home and therefore making choices to live in unacceptable and not-safe environments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They're the issues that we really should be dealing with. While I welcome seeing some amendments to the National Rental Affordability Scheme, it is a pity that it is so little. I remember when this scheme was launched I was fortunate enough to have the then Minister for Housing, Tanya Plibersek, in her role. That is now of course being picked up by the shadow minister for housing and homelessness, Senator Doug Cameron. Both those people have showed a deep commitment to this area of policy. The minister was able to come up to the Blue Mountains, and we opened several places that had been renovated under the NRAS or built specifically to be affordable accommodation. They are good-quality places that have provided people with a secure place to live. Our original scheme provided for 50,000 new, affordable rental buildings, and, given the strong interest in the scheme, we look to extend it to a total of 85,000 buildings. Unfortunately, of course, that program was capped at 38,000 dwellings by the Abbott government in the 2014-15 budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, it is pleasing to see some mention of housing affordability. I think perhaps that the name of the legislation is a little bit misleading. I would much rather be seeing a holistic package that looks at a range of issues that will address housing affordability, and that is everything from addressing some of the tax situations that we have, which Labor will certainly do, to providing more capacity for community based housing.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  Few things in life are more important than shelter. This bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017, seeks to extend the voluntary Rent Deduction Scheme so that rent can be deducted automatically from social security payments, including Newstart, pensions and family tax benefits. Importantly, Tasmania has not agreed to participate in this scheme, and neither have Victoria and the ACT. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A form of compulsory rent deduction was a recommendation from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Road Home</span> homelessness white paper, which the former Labor government commissioned. The former Labor government introduced legislation to enable a compulsory rent deduction scheme, which did not proceed when the coalition came to power. I remind the House that the member for Menzies, who was the then coalition housing shadow minister, complained that Labor's bill would have driven people into housing stress. It's worth remembering that, back then, the coalition's policy on all Labor legislation was to oppose it, no matter the merits of it. I wouldn't mind seeing the member for Menzies come into this House and explain how he could oppose that bill but support this bill, which goes so much further. What a stark contrast between the Liberals in 2013 and the constructive approach of our side under the leadership of the member for Maribyrnong. We have been a constructive opposition. We have approved government legislation that we agreed with, we have sought to amend what we think could be improved and we have opposed what we do not support. That is the way this parliament is mean to work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that the Liberals' record on affordable housing has been absolutely abysmal. We've got here the Liberal record to date, and it is stark. They've failed on so many fronts. The Abbott-Turnbull, now Morrison, government's record on homelessness is that it cut $44 million a year in capital funding for homelessness services in its first budget. In its first budget, it affected some of the most vulnerable people in the country. It failed to provide funding certainty under the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness. It defunded Homelessness Australia, National Shelter and the Community Housing Industry Association to prevent them advocating for homeless Australians. It abolished the National Housing Supply Council and the Prime Minister's Council on Homelessness. It failed to appoint a dedicated minister for housing and homeless. It is now threatening funding cuts for remote Indigenous housing. It's an abysmal record, and this bill, while it goes some way towards addressing housing affordability and people's ability to stay in public housing, does not do nearly enough to address five years of failure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Five years after the Liberals came to officeâfive yearsâwe now have this bill before the House, drawing on the work done by Labor in 2013 but going so much further and incorporating some really nasty stuff, frankly. There are some real punches to the gut, which this government seems all too ready, all the time, to dish out to the poorest and most vulnerable people in this country. It is little wonder that our shadow minister seeks to attach to this bill an amendment that notes the government's manifest failure to address housing affordability. For five years, we've had budget cuts and inaction. We've had five years of making it harder for people to secure affordable housing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some stark differences between this bill and the bill that the former Labor government presented to this parliament. Labor's bill to allow compulsory deductions would have applied only to tenants in rental arrears. This bill applies to all tenants whose income is supplied in whole or in part by social security. Labor's bill would have ensured that tenants were informed when deductible amounts were to be varied; this bill does not require that tenants be notified. Labor's bill limited deductions to rent, rental arrears and household utilities, and we agreed with domestic violence advocates who argued that allowing deductions for property damage could impact victims of domestic violence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill allows for deductions to compensate for loss of or damage to property, and this is of particular concern. It's often women who put their names on the lease, and they're the ones who end up being legally lumbered with the bill when damage is caused through no fault of their own. I do understand the need for people to be responsible and accountable, but domestic violence is complex, and tackling it requires tact. It cannot be addressed with blunt instruments such as this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's approach, both with this bill and on housing and homelessness in general, is in stark contrast to the government's. We put people first. We value people. We want to help people take part in society, not kick them while they are down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Homelessness is a real issue. On the most recent census night, 116,427 people reported being homeless, nearly 14,000 people more than in 2011. The number of people experiencing homelessness has risen by 13.7 per cent since 2011. The rate of people experiencing homelessness has increased by 4.6 per cent over the last five years. This government crows about a growing economy, about growth and jobs, and yet we've got some of the most vulnerable people in our country experiencing homelessness and not having a roof over their head. That rate should be going down, not up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tasmania, my home state, homelessness continues to be a serious problem, and it affects people across all ages. The census in 2016 showed that 1,622 Tasmanians are homeless, more than half of them in the south and mainly in Hobart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most homelessness is hidden. Only eight per cent of homeless people sleep rough. This is worth saying because people think of homelessness as some poor guy sleeping on a park bench. It's much more complex than that. It's kids on Newstart or the jobseeking payments who can't afford rent. They can't stay in a share house. They couch surf. They move from place to place. It's insidious. It makes it much harder for people to find work and stay in work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Homelessness costs the economy. It costs society and it costs the individuals, but it also costs the economy. So Labor will support the passage of this bill through this House, but we do intend seeing it referred to a Senate committee for a deep inquiry into its impacts, and I look forward to seeing what the recommendations of that inquiry are.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  I am broadly in support of the intent of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017, but Centre Alliance reserve our position in the Senate. As many of the speakers have already said, there are two main elements to this bill: the establishment of an Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme for social-housing tenants and a tightening of provisions related to the National Rental Affordability Scheme, also known as NRAS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The object of NRAS was to encourage large-scale investment in housing to increase the supply of affordable rental dwellings and reduce rental costs for low-income households. The technical legislative changes to NRAS that are before us today are welcome and, in my view, non-controversial. However, I would like to take this opportunity to speak out about why NRAS more broadly has merit and why it should be revived in the sense of us ensuring that we have some further funding going into the future in order to buy more housing stock.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">NRAS was an opportunity for community organisations and mum-and-dad investors to be part of the affordable-housing solution. We need investors outside of state governments to grow affordable housing stock. That is the reality. Before I came into this place, I had the great privilege of working for an organisation that's called SYC, formally known as the Service to Youth Council. Their branch that looks after young people is known as HYPA. They were able to expand their transitional housing due to the NRAS. Because it was able to supplement the small amount of rent, they were able to offset the cost of building housing stock.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the Service to Youth Council, they had seven units from 1991 until ultimately 2009-10. However, by the end of the scheme in 2012, they had been able to increase those seven units in a very short period of time to 39 units. What did that mean? That meant that we had scores of young people supported with transitional housing and it provided wraparound services of youth workers in the afternoon and an overarching social worker who could ensure that there was case management for all of those young people and at no point was a young person charged more than 30 per cent of their income, which was often primarily youth allowance, to cover their rent. The scheme is successful for Service to Youth Council and that is because the focus is on it being transitional housing and equipping young people with the skills needed in order to successfully transition into the private rental market after a couple of years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I would urge the government to ensure that there is a policy lever for the wider Australian community, whether that be community organisations or mum and dad investors, to be part of ensuring that we have wide housing stock for affordable housing and that, ultimately, meaningfully addresses homelessness, more than anything else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll move on now that I've talked about NRAS. I have beep talking about NRAS in this place for a couple of years. But I'd also like to talk about the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme. Firstly, Centre Alliance, as a party takes a very dim viewâand I've said this many times to governments, to ministers and to their advisersâwhen you do not disclose the costs associated with a policy. How can I, as a democratically elected member in this place, vote on to the government's proposed legislation when the government refuses to state how much it's going to cost? It is actually offensive that the government will not share with the parliament, as part of their decision making, how much of Australian taxpayers' money it's going to cost. That's the critical key here. This money does not belong to government. This is the taxpayers' collective pool of money. So, when you don't disclose it, it makes it extremely hard for me to support it. I find this lack of transparency and accountability actually quite offensive, and I hope that there are government ministers or decision makers in their team who are listening to this. I want to maintain constructive relationships with you. Centre Alliance wants to maintain constructive relationships with you. But, in order for us to have a strong working relationship with government, you need to be transparent with your policy settings. It is simply not good enough for the community that I represent to hide the monetary cost or benefit to the taxpayer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aside from the lack of transparency, there are a few other issues that I think are important to raise. There is merit in organisations having levers with the primary purpose of reducing homelessness caused by tenants falling into arrears. I also recognise that managing rental income is an administrative burden on state government housing departments where they have a large volume of stock and also on community housing organisations. I've yet to hear, should this legislation go through, whether either state governments or, indeed, community housing organisations are prepared to place what they will be saving with such an automatic scheme back into extra stock. I and Centre Alliance have some concerns with this legislation; however, as has been mentioned by many people in this House, those concerns will be examined further in another place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the first concern and issue that we need to address is: should automatic deductions apply to all tenants or should it be a mechanism available for tenants who regularly fall into arrears? If this is a blanket payment for all tenants who are on Centrelink benefits, we will effectively create two classes of tenants in the community housing and public housing sector: those who are receiving a Centrelink payment and those who are in employment. I think we need to look very carefully at whether there will be some negativity associated with having two classes of tenant. Secondly, should there be a time limit for the automatic deduction? My belief is that it should really only apply for tenants who fall into arrears and, secondly, it should be for a temporary period of timeâa maximum of, say, 12 months. After that time, one would like to think that the housing authority, whether that be public or a community based housing organisation, has been able to support the tenant to ensure that they don't fall into arrears in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to look at whether there should there be a limit on the capping. Should there be a limit to the amount of money that goes to arrears deducted from the Centrelink payment? We need to examine what safeguards will be in place so that tenants are not left with zero income simply because, in that fortnight's payment, their whole money went towards their housing. Ultimately that could lead to some disastrous outcomes where a person doesn't have any money for food, for medical needs and for ensuring that their children are supported to continue their education. I don't think there is a member in this chamber who wants to see a person destitute. The debts can be paid over a broader period of time. When I was with the Service to Youth Council and managing that housing program that I talked about earlier in my speech, we would work constructively with tenants who fell into arrears to ensure there was flexibility around their payments and really work from a position of goodwill to ensure that that debt could be paid quickly, recognising the other debts and commitments that they had.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HENDERSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Social Services, Housing and Disability Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:12</span>):  It's my great pleasure to rise and speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017. The bill introduces the framework for the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme. The ARDS enables rent and utilities to be deducted from income support payments and family tax benefit for occupants living in social housing. The bill also makes amendments to the National Rental Affordability Scheme Act 2008 to streamline and simplify the administration of the National Rental Affordability Scheme, or NRAS, until it ceases operation in 2026-27. The primary objective of the ARDS is to reduce the risk of homelessness for social housing tenants, particularly those in serious rental arrears who could face eviction or housing abandonment. We see this as fundamental to ensuring that people facing housing stress have the security of housing which we know is an absolute right in our community and in our nation. I'm very pleased that the member for Mayo is supporting this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government committed to implementing a compulsory rent deduction scheme for social housing welfare recipients in the 2016-17 budget following a request by the states and territories. As a precondition for participation in the scheme, the minister responsible for housing in a relevant state or territory must write to the Commonwealth Minister for Families and Social Services setting out the social housing policies of that state or territory and how these policies protect tenants from financial hardship. I really want to emphasise that this is about protecting tenants from financial hardship. The last thing that this government wants to see is people being evicted because they have struggled to pay their rent. This gives them security and gives their families security, and we think that this is an incredibly important measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to stress that the ARDS deductions are limited to amounts for rent and household utilities onlyâthe absolute fundamentals. Any arrears incurred due to the suspension of an income support payment cannot be deducted from a single payment under ARDS when the payment recommences. Where the tenant is also part of an income management scheme or cashless debit card trial, deductions will only be taken from the restricted portion of the income support payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments introduced in this bill also clarify ambiguous provisions in the NRAS Act relating to the power to make regulations and lay the foundation to strengthen and simplify the future operation and administration of NRAS. The amendments provide general regulation-making power to enable the government to make changes to the NRAS regulations to protect investors until 2026 when NRAS ceases operating. The amendments also include specific regulation-making powers to support the operation of NRAS and to further protect investors through changes to the regulations, including requiring participants to pass on state and territory investments to investors in a reasonable time and also giving special dispensation where a tenant is inadvertently charged more than the 80 per cent limit, provided that the tenant is compensated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While most approved participants in NRAS behave appropriately towards investors, a small number of approved participants don't do the right thingâwhich makes life exceptionally difficult for investorsâby not passing on incentives promptly and engaging in other undesirable conduct. The government's amendments will permit the Secretary of the Department of Social Services to accept an enforceable undertaking from an approved participant. It's really important to emphasise that the government is committed to putting in place measures to reduce the risk of homelessness for social housing tenants and to reduce rental costs for low-and moderate-income households. The bill will do that through the implementation of the ARDS and the amendments to the NRAS Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to emphasise that so much of what the government is doing at the moment is concerned with addressing the issues of housing affordability and housing security. I had the great pleasure just a couple of days ago in Canberra to make a very important announcement under the Homes for Homes scheme, where some $200,000 has been provided. That great scheme, which is making some real inroads, is supported by a $6 million investment from the Commonwealth. That scheme will address a growing cohort of Australians who are really struggling with housing security, and they are older womenâparticularly women over the age of 55, who have suffered a relationship breakdown or have reached the end of their working life and they've got inadequate superannuation. We're making a lot of inroads into addressing that for women and giving them additional capacity to save for their superannuation. We are seeing an increase in the number of women who are facing housing stress, and I was absolutely delighted to make this announcement. This particular investment will go towards matching a number of women up in the one house and providing them with very secure housing at a reduced rental, which is capped at some 25 per cent of their income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right across the board, the government is working incredibly hard. I do have to say that we are really concerned about some of the resistance on the other side of the House to the amendments and the proposal under our Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme. I say this with a bit of regret. I know there are some members on the other side who support this. There are quite a number of Labor members in the states and territories who also support this measure, because they see this as fundamental to housing security. If the rental payments and the utility payments are deducted from overall income, a family then has peace of mind. The risk of falling into arrears is dramatically reduced. There is still scope for a family, where there is particular financial pressures, to raise issues in relation to the deduction and to deal with them on a case-by-case basis. It is really incredibly disappointing that we haven't seen universal support for this very important measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really tough to secure social housing, which provides families with the support that they need at a cost that they can afford. We all know that families come under extraordinary financial pressures. It certainly happens in my community in Corangamite, and I know it happens all around the nation. When there are competing pressures, this really ensures that the fundamentals are provided and that rent and utilities are paid for. It's really difficult to understand why this measure is not being supported by members opposite, just like all of the consternation with the cashless welfare debit card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is another really important measure where there is the opportunity to provide for the basics of life; to make sure there is food on the table; to make sure kids get the essentials in their family; to make sure that money is not spent as a priority on alcohol, on drugs or on cigarettes; and to make sure that the basics of raising a family are dealt with first. This is a measure that has seen so much incredible support, particularly in the communities where it is being rolled out. We heard about this in question time yesterday. It's really incredibly disappointing to see the resistance from Labor members and also the lack of understanding for many members who may not have spent a lot of time in Indigenous communities. It's very, very difficult to understand why this measure and measures like this are being resisted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other important thing I want to say is that the ARDS responds to the concerns of the states and territories. It works in partnership with the states and territories, the participating jurisdiction, by making the legislation less prescriptive about the form that an agreement can take between a tenant and a social housing provider. It also clarifies that the definition of a social housing lessor includes community housing providers registered under a law of a state or territory. I know there is a lot of support in some states, including some of the Labor states. I reference WA in particular. This stems from some discussions that I've had with the Labor government of WA, which recognises how important this is to the people of Western Australia. The Labor government in WA recognises how important this is for families in Western Australia, who are struggling and who need that sense of security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no greater right for many families than the right to have a roof over one's head. The last thing that we want to see as a government is people being evicted or in severe housing stress with an accumulation of arrears because, for whatever reason, they have not prioritised their utility payments and their rental payments. So I commend this bill to the House. I commend this bill to the House because it is about justice. It is about standing up for families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In everything we do as a government, we are putting Australian families first. We are putting Australians first. We are standing up for those who most need our help. In my portfolio responsibilities as the Assistant Minister for Social Services, Housing and Disability Services, I am really pleased to be standing up for those who haven't had, traditionally, a voice. Through a great deal of bipartisanship in this parliamentâand I make particular reference to the work that's being done to bring the NDIS into full scheme, to roll out that incredible scheme for all Australians with disabilityâI'm really, really proud of the work that this government is doing to stand up for those who most need our help. It's a bit of a common theme when I meet with my constituents. They might seek some funding support for a particular interest of theirs, and I always make the point that, first and foremost, as a government, we need to be standing up for those who most need our help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon, I might add that you and I did a lot of very good work in our parliamentary inquiry into family violence law reform. Again, that was all about standing up for those who have been impacted by family violence, because they most need our help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm really hopeful that the Labor Party might have a change of heart. They might see the merits of this very important bill, this important measure to stand up for families, to give them the financial security and the housing security that they so need. As I say, I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:27</span>):  I will just pick up on what the member for Corangamite just said about helping victims of domestic violence. The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017, as it stands today, could mean that a tenant who is experiencing family or domestic violence could actually be liable for the damage caused to a rented property by someone who is an abusive partner. We don't support this mandatory Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme for all public- and social-housing tenants. Only when we are aiming to prevent homelessness should we apply automatic rent deductions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House will keep those opposite accountable, and we will ensure that we move amendments in the Senate to make sure that those who are the most vulnerable, who are most at risk, those individuals who are in arrears, are not at risk of being left on the streets without a place to live, left behind by this government. We will move an amendment to cap the maximum deduction to prevent the scheme forcing people into housing stress and to make sure that people have money to meet their other needs and pay their other billsâfor essentials, like food.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will also move amendments to require that compulsory deductions can only be made for rent and utilities and not for property damage. This is to protect people from being unfairly held responsible for another person's actions, including in the case of family and domestic violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 86 per cent of public- and social-housing tenants use the Rent Deduction Scheme currently. At the moment, some social-housing tenants are also income support recipients. They can choose to have the Department of Human Services withhold a portion of their fortnightly payment already. Fancy that! Giving people a little bit of choice and control over their own lives! Simply because they are on income support does not mean they need to be treated in this way or demonised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an absolute shame and an outright disgrace to see young people and potential home buyers being locked out of our housing market in this country, with housing stress on the increase and only one per cent of private rentals actually being labelled as affordable. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government can't deliver a pizzaâthey'll probably deliver us another Prime Minister before their term endsâlet alone deliver the housing affordability solutions that we need. They've been in government now for almost six years, and we are still waiting.</span>

These descriptions are often cliches and don't really reflect the effort of the individual in the spotlight. That can't be said, though, of the athletes currently competing in the Invictus Games in Sydney. Invictus means 'unconquerable' in Latin. That is certainly the spirit on display this week. 'Invictus' embodies the fighting spirit of the wounded, injured and sick service personnel taking part. Founded by Prince Harry and first held in 2014, the Sydney games have 500 competitors from 18 nations and 11 sports. Recently, I had the honour of meeting Andrew Wilkinson, who lives in the electorate of Werriwa. Andrew was in peak training for this week's Invictus Games and I appreciate the time he spent explaining his events and the path that led him to wanting to compete. I'm pleased to advise the House that Andrew has so far competed in road cycling and swimming and has won three silver and three gold medals. All these athletes are inspiring for their support of each other and their willingness to succeed. I add my congratulations to them and to Andrew for such a wonderful Games.</span>

A few weeks back, I attended an event organised by the Sikh community in Pakenham. I'm very thankful to the organisers who took the initiative to organise this incredible event where all communities came forward, regardless of race, religion or colour. I would like to thank the Pakenham Sikh community, Gurudwara Baba Budha Sahib ji, the sports club in Pakenham and their members for organising the second jorh Mela. I'd like to acknowledge all the members of the trust, Gurudwara Baba Budha Sahib ji, Hardev Singh, Jagtar Singh, Balrajwinder Singh, Kuldeep Singh, Mohanjit Singh, Lakhveer Singh, Jagdev Singh, Ranjit Singh, Satnam Singh, Sandeep Singh, Onkar Singh, Paramjit Singh, and especially Monty Singh, who arranged the event. I would also like to thank all the sewadars who worked tirelessly to make this an incredible successâthe back bone of the Gurudwara Baba Budha Sahib ji. I want to celebrate the contribution that the Punjabi community, the Sikh community, has made in Australia and especially in the seat of La Trobe. You're an amazing group of people. Thank you for your hospitality and especially the way you welcome all families to your event and into your culture.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  I recently had the enormous privilege of attending the 30th birthday of Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Services with my parliamentary colleagues the Minister for Aged Care and Indigenous health, Senator Dodson and the members for Lingiari and Barton. All of us have a long connection with the centre, which provides a culturally safe, holistic healthcare service for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of the ACT and the capital region. In Wiradjuri language, Winnunga Nimmityjah means 'strong health', and Winnunga offers a breadth of strong medical services and programs that promote good health and healthy lifestyles. Winnunga has come a long way in 30 years. It began life with an annual budget $241,000, a handful of staff and a borrowed laptop computer. It now has an annual budget of $12 million, more than 80 staff and is at the forefront of setting national agenda for quality improvement in Aboriginal community controlled health. I want to congratulate the board, the executive, the dedicated and tireless health professionals and the staff at Winnunga. I also want to remember and honour those who are no longer with us and made Winnunga the success it is today: Olive Brown, Judy Harris OAM, Mary Buckskin, Dr Peter Sharp AO and Piyatissa Jayasuriya. Also the tireless and much loved CEO, Julie Tongs, who's with us here today, Kacey Boyd and the tireless and much loved Beth Sturgess. Thank you so much for your service to our community and the capital region.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  Today I want to acknowledge the wonderful efforts of Deakin's Lions and Rotary clubs and to thank them. We are able to boast of the work of the Croydon, Mitcham, Vermont South, Vermont, Forest Hill and Heathmont Lions clubs, as well as the Croydon, Maroondah, Nunawading, Mitcham and Forest Hill Rotary clubs. These clubs are an integral part of our community, and they continue to offer invaluable support for our local area, including supporting a variety of community projects and local schools and students, as well as a range of local charities. They also provide other essential services, from specific support for women, to men's sheds, homelessness assistance and support for our youth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their work also extends beyond the boundaries of our electorate. Rotary Australia and Lions have, combined, raised well over $10 million to assist drought-stricken farmers in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These organisations also have a global reach. Our local Rotary groups are significantly involved in a range of international aid effortsâthe most notable being their efforts to end polio. Internationally, Lions have, similarly, helped millions of people around the world, who have benefited from 13,000 individual grants that amount to more than $1 billion. A big amount of that support comes from Lions Australia.</span>

The award recognised Mr Collaery's work in fighting for justice for the people of Timor-Leste. ALA National President Ms Noor Blumer said Mr Collaery has spent many years advocating on behalf of the people of Timor-Leste and was legal adviser to the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction in the critical period leading up to formal independence in 2002. Ms Blumer also said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I won't reflect on matters that are before the courts, of course, and I don't have access to the information that the Commonwealth prosecutors do, I do want to acknowledge the ALA award to Mr Collaery, who, during his career, has also represented the victims of such Canberra disasters as the 2003 Canberra bushfires. He also argued for damages for the family of the deceased following the Royal Canberra Hospital implosion. Mr Collaery is a former attorney for the ACT, and I just wanted to acknowledge this ALA award. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The communities of Cedar Creek, Luscombe, Wolffdene and Tamborine Village gathered to learn about native flora and fauna, meet local services and enjoy a range of family activities. The kids from Cedar Creek State School did a wonderful job with their choir as well.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge some of the community groups that joined in the festivities and to share the incredible work that they do in our community. Cedar Creek Wolffdene Rural Fire Brigade go above and beyond to help others in times of need and keep our communities safe. I'd like to acknowledge all the volunteers for the time that they give to look after and protect our community and the critical skills they develop through their training to manage often difficult and dangerous situations. The Forde community owes a great debt of gratitude to the Cedar Creek Wolffdene Rural Fire Brigade, and I want to thank them for their commitment and dedication, particularly last year during the flood emergency. I'd also like to thank the local PCYC Emergency Services Cadets and their leaders for the terrific work they do in partnership with PCYC Queensland, encouraging and motivating our younger members to get involved. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Unfortunately, because of the sitting week, I couldn't be there, but my wonderful team was able to represent me there.

The chamber committee is made of up amazing volunteers, and I commend them for their great work and all they do to help small businesses in the area grow. I particularly commend their president, Kathleen Lewis; and their vice-president, Kim Peries, who are such strong advocates for the chamber's members. I'm glad to support the business events the chamber holds throughout the year. I'd encourage local south-side businesses to sign up and become members, for the support and networking opportunities that they provide. I'm a proud member of the Southside Chamber of Commerce myself. And I'm proud to be part of a government that has passed legislation delivering company tax relief for over 15,000 businesses in Bonner five years early, as well as extending the $20,000 instant asset write-off for another year.</span>

The Mayor's Police Leadership Award winner was Sergeant Lauren Lupi, who has served the Moreland community since 2007. The Collaborative Partnerships Award winner was Inner North Community Foundation, an independent community foundation that does great work. The Contribution to Arts and Culture Award winner was Howard Norsetter, who leads the Moreland City Band. The Contribution to Sport Award winner was the Coburg Lions FIDA, which gives people with an intellectual disability a chance to play footy, and it's a great club. The Youth Contribution Award winner was Achmel Temple, who came to Australia as a refugee and has completed a diploma in community services.. The Community Event of the Year Award winner was The Longest Rally, which raises funds for a charity helping people who have experienced miscarriage, stillbirth and newborn death. The Volunteer of the Year Award winner was Margaret Partridge, who has volunteered tirelessly in her community. The Honouring Women in Moreland winner was Kajal Kiran, a member of the Didi Bahini Samaj Victoria, a group of strong, active Nepalese women. </span>

The #goforzo Walk was named after Zoe McGinty, a local Brisbane girl who, tragically, died last year after contracting meningococcal. I've spoken about her case in this House before. Zoe's mother, Kirsten, has been unstoppable in raising awareness of the risks of meningococcal, and I salute her commitment and compassion.

The group is raising awareness and funds for Endometriosis Australia, as well as creating support networks within Brisbane for those who suffer from this debilitating condition. Endo Awareness Brisbane was started last year by two young Brisbane women. Madeleine was a sufferer of endometriosis, and Keely was her employer, who witnessed the impact and the struggle it inflicted on Madeleine and others. Last month's fundraising lunch, called End Endo 2018, was a sellout event, with almost 300 people from around the Brisbane community coming together at Victoria Park. The young women on the organising committee for Endo Awareness Brisbane deserve recognition for their dedication, commitment and energy. Keep up the great work.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  This week the Victorian Liberal Party became the first state political party to launch a campaign slogan that doubles as a direct attack on the federal branch of their own party. Every press conference held by the Victorian state Liberal Party is now accompanied by a banner brandishing the slogan, 'Get back in control'âawkward! The political party who promised stable government and then delivered the Muppet Show is now promising to take back control. Who's going to be the first federal Liberal Party MP to hold a joint press conference with a state colleague in front of that banner? Will it be the member for Kooyong as he attempts to get back in control of economic policy in the face of the Liberal Party chavistas who want to force the divestiture of the assets of power companies that are insufficiently passionate in their love for coal? Or will it be the member for Deakin as he launches the member for Warringah's next comeback campaign for leadership? Whatever the slogan, a vote for the Liberals, at the state or federal level, is a vote for more cuts and more chaos. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the Andrews Labor government has been getting things done and making things fair, especially in Melbourne's west, with $1.5 billion for the rebuild of the Footscray Hospital and tens of millions of dollars more for countless schools. Good luck to Katie Hall and Melissa Horne, first-time Labor candidates in my community. They are fantastic champions for my community who I hope to have the opportunity to work with for many years to come.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  I rise today to update the house on my campaign to build a radiation therapy unit for those battling cancer in the Great Southern of O'Connor. The federal government has provided $6.6 million to Genesis Care for a linear accelerator to be installed in Albany. Currently those needing radiotherapy need to travel to over 400 kilometres to Perth or Bunbury, even though the doctors and specialists who care for them are right there in Albany. Genesis want to get this service up and running as soon as possible, but we need the state government to assist. In August I wrote to the state Minister for Health, Roger Cook, asking for support and requested he meet with Genesis directly, and to date there has been no response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, recently came to Albany, met with many of those fighting for this machine and threw his support behind the project. He subsequently raised the matter with Minister Cook. To date the only feedback I have received from the state government is through the media, saying I don't know what I am talking about and how expensive this project will be. I am reliably informed that the cost to build a facility to house this machine will be less than half the amount already committed by the federal government to purchase the linear accelerator. Furthermore, a Medicare licence issued with the machine means it will be widely accessible to those in need of radiation therapy in Albany and the broader Great Southern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage everyone in O'Connor to get behind this campaign to bring the radiotherapy unit to this region as soon as possible. To that end, I will be at the Albany Show on 9 and 10 November. Please drop in, say hello and sign our petition.</span>

It's a timely reminder for locals in the electorate of Lalor of the do-nothing Napthine-Baillieu government, who for four years did not plan one school in our growth areaânot one school did they plan. They took away all of the supports for our local public school principals. In contrast, we've got the Daniel Andrews, who this morning made the fabulous commitment to put mental health professionals in every public school in our state. I can't clap loud enough or applaud loud enough that announcement today.</span>

That includes the Treasurer, Tim Pallas, who is delivering $1.8 billion for our local arterial roads. Joining him is Jill Hennessy, the Minister for Health, who recently opened the $80 million development of our local hospital, and Sarah Connolly, first-time Labor candidate for Tarneit, who is out there every day working hard, knocking on doors and talking to locals about what they need. I know that our state members and candidates are ready to go against Matthew Guy and his obsession with control.</span>

We do know, in the Australian farming community, that it is part of the cycle of farming in Australia, but it doesn't make it any easier when it visits its ugly head upon your property. That's why I'm very pleased that today the Deputy Prime Minister announced $15 million towards a regional drought community small grants program. It will make grants available for not-for-profit community groups to deliver projects in drought-affected regions, focusing on reducing social isolation, leadership development and skills training, social and educational participation, addressing disadvantage caused by the drought, reducing volunteer fatigue, building capacity and supporting local economic recovery or renewal. This brings to over $1.8 billion the money that the federal government has invested in supporting farmers through the drought.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have another ask, though. I have been speaking to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the relevant ministers about the Community Support Program, which runs through New South Wales and Queenslandâa million dollars per council. I believe we have councils in South Australia that are affectedâthat need to get sand off roads and deal with other unexpected expensesâand I'm hoping that some kind of provision will be made available for them in the near future. I'll certainly keep batting on that level, because it's a pretty tough ask for a farmer, after his dirt's blown onto the road, for the council to come knocking on his door and say, 'You get it off, mate.' They're at their rope's end. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's a ridiculous proposal and it's being progressed as I speak. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Southern Courier</span> reports that New South Wales government representatives travelled to Florida, in the United States, to discuss the proposal with the bosses of Norwegian Cruise Line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposal is strongly opposed by all in our community. Once again, the Bidjigal people, whose ancestors have called Yarra Bay their home for thousands of years, have not been consulted. They say that this proposal will destroy local traditional fishing areas and livelihoods. It's a crazy plan that will bring massive environmental damage. Botany Bay would once again have to be dredged, risking several protected marine species. A cruise ship terminal will also change the character of this seaside community, with more roads and increased congestion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This ridiculous proposal has only come about because the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, made a captain's call to rule out Garden Island as a location for a new terminal. It came despite the Cruise Industry Reference Group, headed by former New South Wales Liberal leader Peter Collins, clearly recommending Garden Island. So I now ask the new Prime Minister, the member for Cook, who is on the other side of Botany Bay: will you end this madness and rule out a cruise ship terminal for Yarra Bay and reconsider Garden Island as the right location?</span>

This year Remembrance Day will have special significance, as we mark 100 years since the guns fell silent on the battlefields of Europe. It says much about Australians that, a century on, we still pause to honour those men and women who gave their lives during the First World War. We do so because we understand the incredible bravery, sacrifice and endurance of those who were prepared to defend our values in that war and in conflicts since.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across Australia, communities will join our veterans and war widows for Remembrance Day ceremonies. In my own electorate, ceremonies will be held at 11 am at the North Sydney cenotaph in St Leonards Park, at the Garden of Remembrance in Chatswood, at the Hunters Hill RSL sub-branch memorial hall, at the Kirribilli Club on Lavender Bay and in the Lane Cove Plaza. I want to encourage residents in my area to attend one of those services, as I know the support of our community means so much to those who served.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the North Shore of Sydney, around 10 per cent of the local population enlisted during World War I. Over a thousand men and women were never to return. Many more did come home but bore the dreadful physical and mental scars of that brutal conflict. On 11 November we will remember them all. We remain a community and nation grateful for the service of men and women who have rightly become our heroes.</span>

Those on the other side might want to remember who said that. That was former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and he said it before the last federal election.

These are government jobs that should be done by government employees, that that side of politics promised would be done by government employees but that will not be come Monday. It is an outrage. This is the beginning of the privatisation of Medicare by stealth again by those opposite. They can never be believed when it comes to Medicare. It is only Labor that will ever protect Medicare. Clearly this government cannot be trusted with Medicare. It cannot be trusted with Medicare now. It can never be trusted with Medicare, because we know every time we think everything's going okay, they'll try through another door to make another attempt to privatise Medicare.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  Type 1 diabetes is a cruel condition. It has no lifestyle causes and it is entirely unpreventable. When it strikes, it can be hugely debilitating. High sugar intake leads to weight gain, which in turn leads to countless other associated conditions. Living with type 1 diabetes is a very hard life. Until recently, it has also been a short life. People had to endure dozens of blood tests every day just to keep track of their sugar levels. Without vigilance, hypo or hyper attacks could strike, leading to death. Thankfully this world is changing. Continuous glucose monitoring is changing lives. By constantly tracking a person's sugar levels and automatically adding insulin to the body, many people are able to lead much fuller and longer lives. The government committed to and is fully funding this for people aged up to 21, which is a huge help, but every extra year we fund could help thousands more Australians. </span>

Andrew has type 1 diabetes, which has left him in a wheelchair and with many associated conditions. Andrew made the gruelling trip from Bennelong to Canberra as part of a delegation which met with many MPs yesterday to put a human face on this condition. He showed us how hard the condition can be but, more importantly, how, with a great family support network, it is possible to keep smiling and live a full and happy life. Thank you, Andrew, and thank you to your family, particularly Jennifer. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

At the last election, the public voted resoundingly against privatising Medicare and, instead of listening to the public, the coalition had a big sook about the public campaign to save Medicare. The coalition hasn't learnt a thing. They've been caught at it again privatising Medicare by stealth. For the first time, the coalition's bringing contractors into Medicare to do the work of full-time employees. It is happening in Hobart. It is part of a secret coalition plan to get the public used to privatised delivery of service, starting small, planning big. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's proud of the commitment of the Public Service to deliver service to the public. Why doesn't the coalition feel the same? The coalition's obsessed with cutting jobs or contracting out services. Right now people wanting help from Centrelink are stuck in massive queues, either on the phone or in Centrelink offices. Older Australians are forced to wait the best part of a year in some cases just to get their application for the age pension agreed to. Labor will boost jobs and improve services, investing in 1,200 new positions, especially in regional Australia, and will keep Medicare in public hands. We call on the coalition to do the same. Keep Medicare public. Stop privatising our services.</span>

It was to fund a private campaign staff to be political brawlers. Rightly, the Ombudsman conducted an investigation. They found Labor's innocence claims were all a fabrication. Dan Andrews was exposed as the investigation was closed to corrupt allegations. Victoria Police are now questioning Labor's red shirt straightjacket. At first they went after the campaign staff paid their tax-funded packet. Now that's done, Vic Pol are turning their gun to Labor MPs' red shirts racket. When interviewed by police, most Australians comply. They know there are very serious penalties if you lie, which raises the question: why have Labor MPs got reservations and are hiding when Vic Pol comes by? </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The response from Daniel Andrews was: 'Labor's above it. The law applies to Victorians, not Labor MPs who can shun it. We shouldn't be investigated. The allegations are dated. Plus, there's a risk they'll admit that we've done it.' Former police commissioner Kel Glare has turned to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> and declared it an absolute disgrace. He said, 'Victoria is a state of law, not where Daniel Andrews decides the merits of a case.' Victoria will decide come 24 November. The choice is if rorting Labor can go and escape the law or sit in a chair in Spring Street with a glare and think how well they'll get past the door in the jail.</span>

The government has made no decisions on these policies. The government has done two things. Apart from voting no in the General Assembly of the United Nations, together with the United States and Israel, on the matter before the General Assembly last week, I indicated last week that we would initiate two processes. The first was to review without prejudice the Iran nuclear deal. That process is now underway, and that is chaired by the Deputy Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. On the other matter, we dared ask the question and we dared consider that Australia might have a different position on this issue, and we are initiating a process on that matter as well which will fully consult all those who would need to be consulted before a final decision is made.</span>

                  </a>  I consulted with all the ministers of the National Security Committee before I indicated one simple thing, and that is that I found the arguments of the Liberal candidate for Wentworth, the former Ambassador to Israel, Dave Sharma, who had put forward a very, I think, convincing proposition that in advancing a two-state solution we could also consider the possibility of recognising the capital of Israel being Jerusalem persuasive. I don't resolve from that. All I know is that the Australian people know where we stand on these issues and, as always, they have not the faintest idea about where the Labor Party stands. As far as I know, they all think Israel is a rogue state, just like the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:04</span>):  I thank very much the member for Petrie for his question and his commitment to economic policies that are keeping our economy strong so we can guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on. Under our government, unemployment has fallen to five per cent. There are 60,000 fewer people on unemployment today than there were at the last election. Three hundred and fifty thousand jobs were created last year and that includes 100,000 jobs for young Australiansâthe strongest year in youth employment growth that we've seen on economic record in this country. We've had the lowest budget deficit for 2017-18 that we've seen in a decade, and the government's plans are ensuring that the budget is coming back, projected into surplus next year, one year ahead of schedule.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we also know is that the early read on the 2018-19 results for the September quarter shows that our position is $9 billion better off than what I was able to announce in the budget this year, which says one thing: we are on track to deliver a balanced budget next yearâone year ahead of what we had originally proposed to do as a government. That means our AAA credit rating has been affirmed. In addition, from today we know that Fitch Ratings agency has also affirmed that AAA credit rating once again. These are the results of sound economic management and sound economic policies. But it is also true that there were 100,000 first home owners who got into the housing market last year. That is the best result in eight yearsâyoung people being able to buy homes; getting back into the housing market; the best we've seen in eight years and, as a share of all new credit in the housing market, the best since 2012, getting up above 18 per cent. That's what our economic policies and economic management are delivering for the Australian people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's reckless taxes and their reckless approach to electricity prices mean this: they won't take a big stick to the electricity companies, but they will take a big stick to the value of your home. That's what they will do with their reckless policies: abolish negative gearing as we know it and increase capital gains tax. They're quite happy to get the big stick out on the home owners, but, when it comes to the big stick that we say should be applied to the big electricity companies to bring them into line, they drop it; they walk away; they cower under the table. Home owners know that we've got their back. Home owners paying electricity prices know we've got their back. But, on that side of the House, we know this: they won't stand up to the big electricity companies. What they want to do is reach into the pockets of Australians, clawing back more and more tax because they do not know how to run a strong economy.</span>

He knows that the Australian economy is growing strongly. You don't have to take my word for it. Today, Fitch, one of the world's leading credit rating agencies, reaffirmed Australia's AAA credit rating. This comes on the back of 3.4 per cent GDP growth through the year, the fastest rate of growth since 2012 in the height of the mining boom. This comes on the back of unemployment numbers last week at five per cent, the best since 2012. This comes on the back of a budget which is on track to come back to balance a year earlier than expected in 2019-20. And this comes on the back of Standard &amp; Poor's again reaffirming our AAA credit rating. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">All this good work is at risk from a Labor Party that wants to tax you from the cradle to the grave, a Labor Party with five big new taxes: taxes on your income, taxes on your business, taxes on your electricity, taxes on your savings and taxes on your property, with changes to negative gearing and capital gains. Today, the Labor Party frontbenchers and backbenchers have been tying themselves in knots over the negative gearing policy. Even though it was released two years ago, they don't know when it starts, they don't know how it works and they don't know what the impact will be on the value of the family home and on peoples' rents. The Leader of the Opposition tells us that, if you reduce negative gearing, property prices will go down. But what did the member for Rankin, the shadow finance minister, tell us today? The teary 'member for Kleenex', what does he tell us? The member for Rankin said today that, under Labor's negative gearing policy, housing prices will go up. Then the member for Hunter, in that famous interview with the member for New England, said, 'Under Labor's negative gearing policy, prices won't go up or down.' He wants it both ways. No wonder the member for New England said that the member for Hunter has no clue.</span>

The member for Lilley, when he was Treasurer of Australia, said it would be economically reckless to change negative gearing, economically disastrous to change negative gearing, but this Labor Party, desperate for revenue, is taking a sledgehammer to the family home.</span>

On a number of occasions now we have discussed the issues of mental health and of drug rehabilitation and drug services within her electorate and within country South Australia more generally. We know that there is a challenge. The national suicide rate is approximately 11.8 per 100,000. Sadly, as challenging as that is, it is even higher, at about 13.9 per 100,000, in country South Australia. That of course includes the vast bulk of Mayo and Mayo residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the government has been investing very significantly, almost $100 million a year, in headspace across South Australia. We've added a new service in Whyalla, we have expanded our service to Mt Barker and we have added new psychological services across the Fleurieu Peninsula and the Adelaide Hills. The Prime Minister went to South Australia to announce an additional $51 million for headspace, of which $39 million will be directly related to headspace services and centres around the country. That could includeâand I am working with the member specifically on this questionâcapital facilities in relation to the Mt Barker area where $6 million is available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also looking at the expansion of outreach, as has been proposed in other areas of country South Australia by the member for Barker and the member for Grey. The member for Sturt has been a very important advocate, as one of the founders of headspace across Australia. So we are looking at that, and I am very hopeful that we will be able to achieve something. The case is strong, given the very tragic suicide rates and the youth mental health challenges we face. In addition we are looking at expanding outreach servicesâI know that the member for Indi also has very significant challenges in relation to Wangarattaâin the same way that we've been able to work with Grafton and with Lithgow, where there have been spikes in suicide rates due to what are sometimes called suicide clusters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to drug and alcohol rehabilitation, we announced $40 million in the budgetâindeed, the Prime Minister announced it as part of his budget workâwith $20 million going to education, focused on South Australia, and drug and alcohol rehabilitation. There will also be $20 million released for public grants by 30 November. We will be calling for contributions for areas of need and projects that will make a tangible difference, whether it is in a drug rehabilitation service or a drug and alcohol outreach programâthings that will literally have the potential to save lives and protect lives. I will be inviting all South Australian members to work with their community to apply for those. I thank the member for her sincere focus on this.</span>

                  </a>  You did, as far as the eye can seeâon your business, on your property, on your income, on your electricity bill and bringing the big sledgehammer to retiree savings. Jolyon Forsyte is 88 and he lives in Mackay. His wife, Enid, is 84. They are retirees who have worked hard, who have saved hard, who use those franking credits for that holiday, that painting of the house, that little bit of extra money. They have saved their money. They have invested in fully franked shares so they can take advantage of no double taxation on the dividends. Their taxable income in 2016-17 was around $72,000, so they don't consider themselves wealthy. Under Labor's policy of smashing retiree savings, they will miss out on an imputation refund of around $11,000, which means a lot of money to their income and their lifestyle. It is enough to make even the member for Rankin cry! Jolyon only stopped earning a salary at the age of 85. He has never claimed a pension. These are the people we back, these are the people we support. These are the people Labor want to take a big sledgehammer to. They want to whack them. They want to absolutely recklesslyâ</span>

But what I would make very clear is that the government has not made a decision in relation to the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The government has not made a decision on that. What I simply said was that I was persuaded by the arguments that were made by the former ambassador to Israel from Australia, Dave Sharma, about the case he was putting forward and that we would be posing that question and that we would be consulting on that question with a view, down the track, to making a decision. And we will follow the full process that would be necessary to go through to come to a decision on that matter. The opposition doesn't seem to understand the difference between a decision of a government and a question that is being posed. That is the clear distinction that has been made.</span>

He won't stand up to big electricity companies. He won't take a big stick to electricity companies to ensure that customers get the right deal from electricity companies. He won't do that, but he will take a big stick to the house prices of Australians.</span>

Is the minister aware that yesterday at Senate estimates his own department couldn't say what his job was? Additionally, the Minister for Foreign Affairs commented, 'It's fair to say I'm enjoying this.' And his own department had to take the question on notice. Is this just another example of what Australians can expect from a government which the Prime Minister has described as 'the muppet show'?</span>

                  </a>  when it comes to investing in the build-up of Australia's defence capability. The Australian Labor Party lacks any goodwill at all, frankly, when it comes to making sure that the billions of dollars that the coalition is expending in the Defence portfolio goes towards creating jobs; investing in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics of young Australians coming through; investing in advanced manufacturing; and, most importantly, making sure we have a pipeline of investment in the next generation of capability for the men and women who serve in the Australian Defence Force. That's the contrast between the coalition, the Liberal and National parties, with our pipeline of investment, and the Australian Labor Party. These guys are much more interested in being involved in the Canberra bubble and they're much more interested in playing games around politics than they are in knowing the facts about what our Defence Force is doing.</span>

                  </a>  The simple fact is that, as I said, the Liberal and National parties will keep investing in defence capability and will keep investing in Australia's defence industry. And, most importantly, we will make sure the men and women of Australia's Defence Force come home safely, because we're prepared to invest in safeguarding them, creating jobs in Australia and making sure our defence industry is strong.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, because it's clearly beyond the shadow minister opposite, let me make it clear. Maybe you've got your smart phone in front of you. You might want to punch in www.minister.defence.gov.au, because you'll see there's a full list of responsibilities there. So, if it's far beyond you to know what it is, I suggest you have a look.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, more importantly than that, what I'd say to the Australian Labor Party is that you need to take seriously the Australian defence industry and you need to invest in capability, because your track record is shameful. For six years, the Australian Labor Party did not commission a single new vessel for Australia. For six years you failed to invest in Australian jobs. For six years you failed to take seriously what we're doing in defence industry. We've corrected the record. We've made sure that we've got the defence industry back on track. We're creating jobs. We're investing $200 billion. And we are making sure that, under our watch, we won't go back to the lowly and miserly 1.38 per cent of GDP that existed under the Australian Labor Party. So you stand condemned for six years of inaction, and we stand proud beside the men and women of the Australian Defence Force.</span>

On Tuesday this week, we announced our plan for affordable, reliable power, which will help families and businesses up and down the Central Coast, including in the member's electorate of Robertson. Our plan will reduce prices by stopping the price gouging with our big-stick legislation, which we'll be bringing to the parliament later this year. A fair price safety net for customers who don't get around to negotiating will be in place by 1 July next year, with a down payment for all customers on 1 January.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're backing investment in reliable generation with a short list of projects by early next year. From 1 July, we'll require energy companies to commit to invest years ahead to make sure they've got the affordable, reliable capacity in place to serve Australian customers. The AEMC found that customers on standing offers could be paying up to $832 more per year than alternative market offers. Small businesses could be paying up to almost $3Â½ thousand more. This loyalty tax is outrageous. You can have two houses or two businesses side by side with exactly the same energy usage and one can be paying thousands more than the other. The rip-offs have to stop. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member asked about alternatives. This morning, the <span style="font-style:italic;">AFR</span> announced that Labor will side with the big energy companiesâtheir big rip-offs and their record profits. The shadow minister doesn't come into question time armed with questions for me; he comes armed with a toothpick, and that is his position. That's his position. He just wants to take a toothpick to the big energy companies so they can keep their prices high and keep their record profits. As I've said from the beginning, my single focus is to get prices down for Australian families and businesses and, if we need to use a big stick, we will do it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care and Minister for Indigenous Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:39</span>):  I thank the member for Berowra for his question and his ongoing interest in senior Australians. As a government we are carefully managing the economy. We are building the strength of the economy so that we are able to reinvest in programs and services for senior Australians, the aged-care sector and for society in general. By carefully managing the economy we are encouraging people to investâto invest in blue-chip shares and to invest in a range of other opportunities, such as new housesâand realise a dividend for themselves, so that, when they retire, they have a source of income.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to read to you an extract from a letter from Mr Hemsworth, an RAAF veteran who is not eligible for a service pension. He was a tradesman who saved for his retirement but is set to lose more than 30 per cent of his income if these changes go ahead. Let me read what he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It really pains me and makes me extremely angry to have to write to a political party for the first time. I should not have to protect my family from federal politicians who blatantly want to steal 31% of my hard earned annual income and it makes me sick in the stomach that you blokes who have the best superannuation in the country, want to steal from my super without a second thought. My crime is to have been able to procure over many years, shares in Australian companies that earn taxes/income for the country and employ many thousands of Aussies. These dividends allow me and my partner to live comfortably without any input from the public purse, and very limited benefit from my one and only concession.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">If the excess franking refund is removed then we lose $28,000 in actual incomeâabout 31% of our real income, and this would reduce our annual income down to about $62,000.</span>

Given that when he was Treasurer he believed a banking royal commission was a 'populist whinge' and voted against it 26 times, doesn't this just proves that, no matter what this Prime Minister says now, protecting the big banks and the top end of town is in his DNA?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Jobs, Industrial Relations and Women</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:44</span>):  I thank the hardworking member for Ryan for her question. Given the terrific jobs figures that we have seen under the government's strong economic plan, with more than 1.1 million new jobs created, I can understand precisely why she is concerned about militant and reckless unions. It is because the member knows that militant unions, who harbour militant law-breakers, are a threat to continuous and record jobs growth. That is why the government has taken very strong action to protect workers from bullying, thuggery and intimidation by those militant union bosses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have re-established the tough cop on the beat with the Australian Building and Construction Commission. We have established the Registered Organisations Commission. We have legislation in the Senate right that would now that would stop workers' entitlement funds from being used as slush funds. We would get rid of those dodgy union officials who would be dishonest in using those moneys. Of course, we have a raft of legislation before the Senate that would protect workers' superannuation entitlements and would stop the rorts and the rip-offs that were created by the Leader of the Opposition when he actually served in the Treasury benches for those low-balanced accounts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are very good and sensible reforms that will protect workers and will protect their hard-won and hard-earned entitlements. Not only do those opposite not support them but, if they got a chance, they would get rid of them in their entirety. That is because they are under the thumb of the militant unions. These are militant unions that the courts have said would place themselves above the law. We have seen rallies right across the country this week by the self-proclaimed law-breaker herself, Sally McManus. Who else did we see joining Sally McManus at these rallies, whether they be in Melbourne or other places? We have seen her stand next to that law-breaker, John Setka himself, who is famous for assaulting police officers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But who else was there in Melbourne? It was the Labor Premier Daniel Andrews, who not only endorsed the law-breaking and lawlessness agenda but revealed that he has no respect for the rule of law either. We have seen, under Daniel Andrews, that the Victorian Labor Party, under his leadership, has rorted almost $400,000 from Victorian taxpayers to pay political operatives during the 2014 state election. We now hear that Victorian Labor Party MPs will refuse to cooperate with police. Under Victorian law, we have seen the law-breakers become the lawmakers. Under Bill Shorten, it would be the same thing.</span>

As all Australians can recall, the fact is that, when Labor were in government for six years, 50,000 people arrived on 800 boats and tragically 1,200 drowned at sea. Labor put into detention 8,000 children. They put thousands of people on Manus and Nauru. We have worked every day since to make sure that we've got all of the children out of detention here in Australia. We're doing the same on Nauru. We're very close to getting it to zero. We will achieve what Labor could never have imagined.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Labor were in government today, it's very clear that the boats would be flowing. They put forward this half-understood policy in relation to New Zealand, saying that everybody should go from Nauru to New Zealand. What they forgot is that, where there is a negative assessment in relation to the security of a particular individualâsay, a father within a family unitâthey would compel that person to go from Nauru to New Zealand. Is New Zealand going to take that person? Of course they're not. Should Australia take that person if it's assessed by the United States or one of our Five Eyes partners or our intelligence agencies here that that individual is a threat to Australian security? Of course we shouldn't. But the Labor Party have come up with this policy which sends a green light to people smugglers and which would see children unaccompanied on boats coming to our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're seeing reports on people who have gone from Nauru to the United States that it is a bit harder than they thought it would be because they need to find work in the United States and they're saying to people on Nauru now, 'You'd be better to go to New Zealand or Australia because they have better welfare systems.' Are we going to create an environment where people smugglers are put back in charge? That's exactly what they said. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you think that the Labor Party has control of the internal machinations on this border protection policy? They don't. Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard lost control of our borders. This Leader of the Opposition, if he is elected at the next election, will be on the same path as Rudd and Gillard. We will see kids back in detention. We will see kids back on Nauru. It's the policy of the Labor Party today that, if a boat arrives including women and children, every single person would go to Nauru. So why would we believe Labor? Why would we trust Labor when it comes to border protection? The Australian people cannot trust Labor. They are reckless on border protection policy. The fact is that New Zealand is a pull factor. The New Zealanders know it. Australians know it. Most importantly, the people smugglers know it.</span>

There is the accountability regime that we put inside banks; the new deputy chair of ASIC, the special prosecutor Daniel Crennan QC, who will be a cop on the beat; the extra resourcing that we have provided to our regulators; the fact that we are taking action across the board and that we await the final report from the Hayne royal commission in February next year. Unlike the Labor Party, we don't think we know better than the royal commissioner. The Leader of the Opposition and his shadow ministers are going around the country pretending that they know better than the royal commissioner. The royal commissioner has made plain and clear in his interim report that banks have put profits before people. We are taking action today. We'll continue to take the necessary action to put the consumers of Australia first.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">):</span>  I thank the member for Calare for his very serious question. Having a strong economy helps us invest in looking after country communities, which are doing it pretty tough at the momentâvery tough, indeedâwith the effects of the drought. To date, the government's investment has been more than $1.8 million in drought assistance and we are determined to play our role and help with the assistance and recovery efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recently announced $15 million in support for local community groups through the Foundation for Rural and Regional Renewalâa very, very good organisation. This morning we released the guidelines, and applications open tomorrow. We want to support communities dealing with the drought. We want to get the money flowing into drought affected communities to make sure that they have that income flowing around and to make sure that people know they are supported. There's the Drought Communities Program, with funding to five local shires in the Calare electorate, which is helping councils generate work and get money flowing, and 55 others throughout Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. I appreciate, I acknowledge and I recognise too that South Australia is doing it tough as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the FRRR, there's the investment into small community grants, which is also helped by philanthropic donations. That's also helping. Right around the nation, kids are giving up their pocket money, businesses are helping and people are supporting, and that is fantastic. But this is about investments for non-profit organisations to help such things as social gatherings, reducing social isolation, drought information sessions and forums, as well as getting vital community gatherings for our rural and regional communities. Those eligible should visit the foundation's website frrr.org.au. We're seeing the best of regional Australia and the best of human nature and people's goodwill revealing itself during this crippling drought. We're seeing the best from organisations such as Lifeline Central West. That's a fabulous organisation led by Chief Executive Officer Stephanie Robinson. She's seen the effects of the drought firsthand and her organisation is certainly getting in there and helping. The member tells me that that organisation, Lifeline Central West, have been doing some fantastic work in the Calare electorate around the drought, including the development of a drought toolkit. They've also helped with a number of drought toolkit talks around the region, in Orange and Bathurst so far, which aim to equip people who are in regular contact with those affected by the drought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomorrow, here in Canberra, we'll be having the drought summit, where we will meet with stakeholders and we will continue, as a parliament, as a government, to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with people who are doing it very, very tough. Together, we will get through this drought. Our farmers and our rural communities are the most resilient people in this landâmake no mistake. It's all about tackling tough times together. United as one: as a government and as a nation.</span>

What the government believes in is having the Fair Work Commission, which is an independent agency which determines wage matters in the Australian economy. The government does not believe that the Leader of the Labor Party or any politician should be setting people's wages. We don't believe they should. We believe in the independent process of the commission, which was set up by the Leader of the Labor Party when he was in government. We do not think there should be the chaos of people's wages being determined by the politics of politicians. We think there should be a certain and fair process, where the issues can be considered and reasonable decisions can be determined, and workers and employers can get on about the job of growing our economy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:01</span>):  I thank the member for Grey for his question. In fact, I was in the electorate of Grey recently and attended the Jamestown Show, where I was fortunate enough to do a Q&amp;A in front of 200 farmers, who expressed to me their concern about the cancer of this drought that continues to spread right across eastern Australia and now into South Australia. They expressed to me their concern and their desire, their need, for supportâsupport for their families and their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Proudly, our government has lifted the farm household assistance program by $12,000. We're now putting $37,626 into families' pockets, to make sure that their household expenses are being paid for, to give them the dignity, the respect and the time to make decisions during this tough drought. We're supporting that by also making it more accessible, by extending the net asset test from $2.6 million to $5 million, to make sure that those who are doing it hard, right across the board, are able to get this assistance in terms of household payments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also made sure that we've understood that this drought has been prolonged more than anyone ever thought. We've extended the term from three to four years, to make sure that the time to be able to make those strategic decisions is allowed. We've put in place a mechanism, through our rural financial counsellors, investing in an additional 39 counsellors to complement the 116, to sit around kitchen tables and help them fill out the application. We understood that the application was long and tedious; we've cut it by a third. But we've also worked with Centrelink to make sure that we can open them on Saturdays, to expedite these applications, to get that money into farmers' pockets. We understand the importance of giving our farmers that dignity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why it's important that, tomorrow, the drought summit that the Prime Minister has called brings together a review of our drought policy, which, with all due respect, has been bipartisan since 1992, and we thank those on the other side. But we need to make sure that our drought policy for the future is fit for the future, and it's important that we bring federal and state agencies, charities and industry together to work to ensure that we have the best framework to support our farmers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should always remember that our farming families are the cornerstone of regional and rural Australia. But it's also important to understand that the story of agriculture is still a good one. It's one of 'just add rain'. We've taken the agricultural sector from a $36 billion industry to a $64 billion industry in just eight years, and that has been predicated on trade agreements. The important thing is to understand that, while the drought has hit, ABARES estimates that, even this year, we will still have a $60 billion industry that is contributing to the Australian economy. We should be proud of the fact that our Australian farmers produce the very best food and fibre in the world.</span>

Remembrance Day is about respect and recognition. We wear our red poppies and we pause to remember the fallen. I urge all Australians to attend a local service, to wear a red poppy and to pause for one minute at 11.00 am on 11 November. In that minute's silence, we remember the service and sacrifice of the 416,000 Australians who enlisted; the 62,000 who never made it home; and the thousands more who returned, carrying the scars with them for the rest of their lives. We thank them for their service. We thank their families and their loved ones for their service, too. I've said before in this place that in many ways the home front has been as important as the front line, throughout our history, in caring for our Defence Force personnel. </span>

Right here in this place, Mr Speaker, you and I viewed earlier today 30,000 poppies which are on display above the Marble Foyerâeach poppy handcrafted with love, in remembrance. I thank members opposite who I know have visited the War Memorial as well to see the 62,000 poppies on its grounds, each of which represents one person killed in the Great War. Each poppy is unique and individual in its own wayâpart of the more than one million poppies that have been made inspired by Lynn Berry and Margaret Knight, who first set out to crochet just 120 poppies for the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These individual poppies are a reminder to us all. We often think of our ADF members as some sort of homogeneous group. We tend to see only the uniform and think that perhaps they're all the same, but they're not. They're all individualsâsomeone's brother, someone's sister, someone's husband, someone's wife, someone's son, someone's daughter, someone's best mate. To our current members of the Australian Defence Force, I simply say: on behalf of all members in this place, thank you for your service; you help keep us safe in an often challenging world. On Remembrance Day, as we pause to remember the fallen, we should also pay our respects, I think, to the current serving men and women of the Defence Force, and their families.</span>

Firstly, I thank the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for their words. I can think, frankly, of no better demonstration of the spirit of those who we lost 100 years ago than what we've seen in Australia over the past week in the spirit of those who've been competing in the Invictus Games in Sydney. It has been truly remarkable. Jenny and the girls have been out there this week seeing the events, and they've told me stories about courage and determination from all the athletes from all the countries that are represented there. I want to thank Sydneysiders for getting behind the games and recognising all those great athletes. I think that's a fitting tribute as we go into Armistice Day.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">The SPEAKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:13</span>):  Members may recall that last Thursday I provided the House with an update on the installation of the electronic access control system to members' suites and indicated I would provide a further update to members this week on the status of the broader security upgrade works at Parliament House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the 2014 review of security arrangements at Parliament House, the Department of Parliamentary Services has undertaken a large program of works aimed at improving the security of the building, including strengthening entry points, the building fabric and security infrastructure. A large amount of this work has been finished. Work on the perimeter fence is complete. Planting of the landscape barrier along the fences is now underway. The process of upgrading and installing new CCTV security cameras has now been completed. This project formed part of the overall electronic security upgrade works, which are expected to conclude in late November.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I advised the House last Thursday, installation of the electronic access control system to members' suites has been completed. The system is now being progressively activated. Hardening of the windows in the House of Representatives wing was finished in August. Work on the Great Hall skylight is now finished, with all skylight upgrades expected to be complete in November. The canopy and scaffolding have been removed from the roof. Replacement of grass on the roof and the southern ramp is now underway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst there's been a great deal of progress, members should also be aware that a lot of work remains to be done. Work's continuing on the Senate and House of Representatives slip-road exit and entry gates. The gates won't be used until the necessary policies and procedures are in place. The new gates and turnstiles on each side will be finalised and commissioned once the new entry work is finished.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Construction work on the doors on level 1 between the public and private areas of the building is due to be completed during November. Window works to the front facade, including the gift shop, Queen's Terrace and Visitor Services, are scheduled to commence during November. Work on the second public entrance is expected to be completed in this financial year. Installation of the ceremonial doors at the front of the building is due to conclude by the end of April next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I do have to say that work on the House of Representatives and Senate entrances is the subject of some major delays, which are beyond our control. A revised schedule is being developed by the contractor to ensure these works are concluded as soon as possible. In the meantime, the temporary entrances will remain in place until early 2019 at the very earliestâlet me stress: at the very earliest. This is complex and time-consuming work. I'm mindful of the inconvenience it has caused to members and the staff, but, as you know, the current program of building improvements is critical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The patience and goodwill of members and their staff have been appreciated during the undertaking of these challenging but important works. I thank the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  I'm faced today with a pretty monumental task, trying to condense five years of government failures on Medicare into a single 10-minute speech. I could very easily spend 10 minutes just on their disastrous six-year Medicare freeze, which has ripped billions of dollars out of Medicare and forced up the cost of health care for all Australians, a freeze that continues in part today. I could spend 10 minutes on the infamous 2014 budget, where they sought to run a wrecking ball through our universal health insurance scheme by making everyone pay more to see the doctor, or on their attempts to dismantle bulk-billing incentives or to privatise the Medicare payments system. And that's not even to mention their overblown claims about daily PBS listings or their savage ongoing cuts to hospitals, including their new retrospective cuts of hundreds of millions of dollars for public hospitals. I could definitely spend 10 minutes just talking about their five years of failure when it comes to Medicare-licensed MRI machines. Yes, they've finally acted on that now, after pretty much copying Labor's policy. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Minister, so thank you very much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alas, I don't actually have an hour; I have just 10 minutes, so I'll do my best. Labor, as everyone knows, is the party of Medicare. We invented it, and we will always protect it. It is the heart and soul of our healthcare system, and it is the envy of countries around the world. More than 20 million Australians access Medicare services every year. It is without doubt one of the most important programs that the Commonwealth government delivers. It's fundamental not just to our health system but to our economy and the very fabric of our modern society. It took two Labor governments more than two decades to shape and embed the Medicare that we know today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians take Medicare for granted, and I wish they could take it for granted, because, in the Labor Party, we believe Australians should be able to rely on Medicare wherever they need it, without worry, without a second thought. But the Australian people cannot take Medicare for granted, because, every single time the conservatives get into power, they start to look at creative ways to dismantle it. Remember the $7 co-payment from just a few years ago? That was an unprecedented attack on the universality and accessibility of Medicare, effectively ending bulk-billing. It was a policy that would have forced up the cost of seeing a GP and the cost of hospital pathology and X-rays.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister likes to pretend that all things just started with him. You've got history in the party on the government benches in what you've done to Medicare, so you need, in your address, to actually address what you've done since 2014: cut after cut after cut. The co-payment that was in that budget wasn't just targeted at the wealthy or well off; it was everyone, including children and pensioners, the chronically ill and the poorest, most disadvantaged people in our nation. The Liberals wanted to use this co-payment as a price signal to deter going to the doctor. That is what they said was exactly what they wanted to do. Can you believe it? Their health policy at the time revolved around deterring people from actually seeking health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we know that the people who don't go to the doctor typically get sicker and sicker and end up costing the health system more. So the conservative prescription was to make people sicker and end up spending more on the health system in the long runâabsolute genius. It was Labor, it was the parliament and it was the Australian people who ultimately stopped this government going down that road. As is so often the case, we helped save the government from themselves, but the plan revealed what was actually in their hearts. And when they couldn't get that plan through, they resorted to extending the freeze on Medicare rebates. Again, under intense pressure from Labor, doctors and the public, the minister announced a gradual thaw in the six-year freeze in May 2017, but he still hasn't actually lifted it all today. Many elements will still remain up until 2020. That is six years of slugging doctors and ultimately patients, simply because they won't want to access our health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently visited the Gold Coast and met with Professor John Corbett. After providing bulk-billed specialist EEG services for over 20 years, John Corbett has recently been forced to cease providing these services because of the government's ongoing freeze. That means higher costs for patients, and this sort of thing is happening all over the country. The rebate freeze has ripped $3 billion out of Medicare, and the Liberals are still banking savings from those cuts today. That's $3 billion ripped out of the pockets of patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of months ago, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare finally laid bare the full extent of the health affordability crisis in Australiaâa crisis inflicted by this government. The report showed that Australians are spending nearly $30 billion on out-of-pocket health expenses a year. That includes $3 billion a year on nonhospital Medicare-subsidised services. Half of all patients have incurred out-of-pocket costs to see a GP or a specialist or have blood tests, X-rays or other scans. Seventy per cent of patients seeing specialists made some out-of-pocket payment, and more than a million people spent $600 or more on medical gap fees. As a result of these costs, 1.3 million people are either delaying or skipping seeing a doctor or getting a test when they need it, putting their wellbeing and their lives at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The AIHW report also exposed this minister's claims about bulk-billing. The data shows that only 66 per cent of patients are bulk-billed by their GP, a far cry from the 86 per cent figure the minister trots out on a daily basis. The Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association confirmed that the figures cited by the minister are in fact misleading. That's a nice way of saying they're a complete con job and totally meaningless. You cannot trust this minister. Malcolm Turnbull couldn't trust this minister. This minister lined up in this place to profess support for the former Prime Minister, all the way working with the member for Dickson to tear him down. And how well did that work out for the minister? Remind meâis the member for Dickson the Prime Minister? And how many votes did the minister actually get for the deputy job? I think it was 16. His colleagues can't trust him and neither can the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same when it comes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Every other day the minister tries to trumpet this government's record when it comes to listing new medicines. It's basically all that he talks about nowadays, probably because their achievements elsewhere in the health portfolio are so evidently lacking. But, when he does, he so conveniently forgets to mention that it was his government, in fact, that tried to increase the co-payment, which would have forced up the cost of PBS medicines by up to $5, including for vulnerable pensioners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite all the government's cuts and failures, they still make the remarkable claim that Medicare has never been stronger and that their commitment is rock solid. But you can't judge them on what they say. You have to, of course, judge them on what they do, and their record is an appalling one. In Senate estimates earlier this year, officials said that the government's 2018 budgetâand this is the government officialsâwas trying to bend the cost curve of Medicare. That's the government's fancy new way of saying 'a cut'. The government also wants to bend the Medicare cost curve until it actually breaks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also now broken an election promiseâanother one. In the election campaign they gave an unequivocal commitment that every element of Medicare services would continue to be delivered by the government. That is the commitment the then Prime Minister gave. They gave that commitment after they got the scare of their lives as we were fighting so hard against their privatisation agendaâthe agenda to privatise the Medicare payments system, which is what you were doing. You are now trying to do it by stealth. We understand, as exposed by the member for Chifley, that 12 contract staff are set to administer Medicare payments for the first time in Hobart. It is the start, again, of the privatisation of Medicareâthe privatisation of the Medicare payments system, bringing in contractors for the first time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You bet we're going to absolutely highlight your hypocrisy. You're trying to do it absolutely again. This is a government that has fought and hated Medicare every single step of the way. They dream of an Americanised health care system where every man, woman and child should care for themselves, where people die or suffer for years because they cannot afford a doctor and cannot afford to go to a hospital. This is their vision for Medicare, a two tiered systemâopposed all the way, every day, by Labor.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUNT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:26</span>):  I am delighted to speak today because I've got a simple message: you cannot trust Labor to list medicines because you can't trust Labor to run the economy. How do we know this? Last time they were in government they blew the budget and the economy, and they stopped listing medicines. Seven medicines were deferred by the then assistant Treasurer, the now Leader of the Oppositionâand the would-be next Labor Prime Ministerâon the basis that, due to fiscal circumstances, the government would 'defer medicines until fiscal circumstances permit'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me translate that budget paper to what it means for ordinary Australians. It meant that Australians were unable to get a medicine approved by the PBAC, approved by the medical experts, because of a decision by government to stop listing medicines for conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, endometriosis, schizophrenia and for women engaged with IVF. These were conditions for which the previous government, with the same people in charge as nowâa Leader of the Opposition who was the assistant Treasurer, a Deputy Leader of the Opposition who was a health minister under that government and a member for Ballarat who had a certain history with regional issues and now wants to administer a $100 billion health budgetâwanted to stop listing medicines. That is the reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't trust Labor to list your medicines because you can't trust them with the economy. Their track record proves this. They deliberately and consciously overrode the advice of the medical experts and hoped that it would never be realised that they were denying Australians vital medicinesâafter they had reached agreement on price with the companies in question. That is extraordinary and something which should never be repeated in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn to Medicare. I'm really proud of what we've done in our time, on our watch, in relation to new items being listed on the Medicare schedule. More than 200,000 Australian women a year will have access to 3D mammogram screening, there will be new MRI tests for prostate cancer and there will be better access for renal dialysis in remote and rural Australia, with a particular focus on Indigenous communities. What does that translate to? Over the current four-year period we go from $25 billion to $26 billion to $27 billion to $29 billion of investment in Medicare per year. Each year, it will travel by more than a billion dollarsâa $4.8 billion increase at the last budget alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Listening to Labor you would think, 'Gosh, they must have had a higher figure.' No. When I looked at the figures for Labor in 2012-13, their last full year, it was a budget of $19.5 billion for Medicare. By the time this forward estimates period is over it will be $29 billion, almost a $10 billion increase in outlays on Medicare. Each year, every year, there is record investment and record increases. What we're seeing is each year, every year, a record investment in and record figures for Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is very interesting is they did mention the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. I do actually happen to have a report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. It's their 2016-17 review of health expenditure. There was something I hadn't quite realised, and I apologise for not having picked this up earlier. But I'm enjoying my research, as the member of Ballarat encouraged me to do, looking to the past. I was looking at some of Labor's figures. I have been encouraged by the member for Ballarat to look back at the recent history. What did the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare say in relation to table 3.3 on total health expenditure in 2012-13? It was $64 billion. That's a reasonable figure. The growth in that year, for Labor's last full-year budget, was minus 2.6 per cent. So they cut health in their final budget dramatically. In their last full year, it was minus 2.6 per centâa $1.7 billion cut. That was their watch, their time and their responsibility. Of all of the topics they could have picked to talk about, to have a 2.6 per cent cut to the overall health budget in their last full year in government, is a classic Labor con. They talk about a belief in Medicare and, yet, the health budget in their last full year was down by $1.7 billion. It was down by 2.6 per cent. That's not our figures. It's from the Institute of Health and Welfare to which they referred themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me perfectly to the question of bulk-billing. The bulk-billing rates are up. Not only are they up; they are up significantly and dramatically. Where are they now? They were at 82.2 per cent under Labor. They're at 86.1 per cent now. What does that mean? It means, for every 100 visits to the general practitioner, 86 per cent of them are completely free to the patient. They pay no outgoings whatsoever. Every 100 visits, 86.1 per cent are free. For some reason the member for Ballarat seems to dispute these figures. I also did a little bit of history. I looked at the last time there was Labor commentary from a Labor minister using exactly the same methodology and exactly the same processes. That was on 13 May 2013. The then Minister for Health, the current member for Sydney, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, crowed about bulk-billing rates for GP services reaching a new record high of 82 per cent in the March quarterâthe highest rate in Australia's history, at the time. And, yet, this is using exactly the same figures and exactly the same comparator. I haven't heard the member for Ballarat say that it was all a fraud when Labor was in government. It's the same figures and same methodology, unchanged through Medicare and unchanged through the assessments. So what we see is that we've gone from 82 per cent under Labor to 86 per cent under the coalition. That's the reality. Bulk-billing rates are up almost four per cent under this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What that means is that fewer patients are having to pay to go to the doctor. Fewer patients are having to pay. But, even for those who are, right now we're embarking on a reform that's never occurred in Australia. The Chief Medical Officer is bringing together the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, physicians, the AMA, GPs and others to ensure that we have a transparency model for out-of-pockets, which has never occurred in this country on this scale. That's something that we initiated. It's something that I requested the Chief Medical Officer to commence and it's something which will have, I believe, an important and critical impact and will be a historic step forward in transparency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we go to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I couldn't be more delighted to discuss this topic. Bizarrely, Labor has started to question whether or not listings have actually occurred. I just want to take you to one of the more embarrassing interchanges last night, when Senator Watt tried to deal with this in estimates and Senator Dean Smith asked the departmental people exactly how many listings there were. He said, 'Did I hear, Ms Shakespeare,' the deputy secretary of the department, 'in your evidence, that there have been 1,900 new or amended listings that have taken place since 2013?' Ms Shakespeare said, 'I'll just check that number for you.' And I do apologise to the House; I haven't been completely correctâI had been saying 1,900. The evidence from Deputy Secretary Shakespeare was, '1,920 new and amended listings.' Dean Smith said, '1,920 new or amended listings have taken place since 2013; that's correct?' 'Yes, October 2013.' Dean Smith said: 'That's very specificâOctober 2013. So that could translateâand maths was never my strengthâbut that could translate to one per day?' Deputy Secretary Shakespeare from the department said, 'That's new and amended listings, averaging 31 per month, approximately one per day.' Even when they are trying to make it up, they can't get it right. So what we see is that, yesterday, we had new medicines which will help 4Â½ thousand patients with macular degeneration and with issues such as blood clots in the eyes. This is about giving 4Â½ thousand patients access to medicines that will transform their lives. In the end, we're transforming lives, we're investing in Medicare and we're giving Australians security for their health future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:36</span>):  Once again we heard the Minister for Health spending much of his time speaking about the listing of new medicines. The listing of new medicines is nothing new. It has been going on as part of government policy regardless of who is in government for decades. But the minister of course didn't talk about the delays of the listing of the new medicines that he refers to. More importantly, the minister spent his time speaking about the listing of new medicines in order to deflect from his government's failures and his personal failures in managing the health system of Australiaâthe failure to adequately fund our hospitals, with a $2.8 billion cut between 2019 and 2025; a $715 million cut over this three-year cycle; a failure to adequately fund our health professionals, and that refers directly to the six-year Medicare freeze, which is still going; and a failure to adequately fund medical professionals, such as doctors who do after-hours visits and, in particular, how that affects the residential aged-care facilities of this country. Indeed, the out-of-pocket costs to Australians wanting to see their doctor are increasing. Medicine scripts are not being filled or are being delayed, as are GP visits and doctors visits more broadly. For dentistsâand I haven't got time to go into the detailsâthe out-of-pocket costs reached $240 per person last year. In Australia's most disadvantaged communities, over one-quarter of people delay seeing or do not see their dentist. Today we heard of the government wanting to use labour hire staff in Medicare officesâagain, a step towards privatising Medicare. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cuts to public health are intended to do two things: (1) to push people into private health insurance and (2) to push the responsibility onto the public health system of the state governments by sending people to the hospitals. But what we've seen happen with respect to both of those matters is that, with private health insurance, costs have increased to over a thousand dollars more per year per person. We're seeing people dropping their policies because of that. We've also seen the government now delay by one year the introduction of its gold, silver, bronze new private health insurance system because the government knows that proposal will increase the costs and reduce the services that people get from that cover, and it didn't want to introduce that policy just before the next federal election. It wouldn't have been a good look for them to do that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've also seen is elective surgery waiting lists blowing out. In particular in my stateâand I understand it's happening in other states as wellâwe're seeing ambulance ramping. It's happening because people are avoiding going to their doctor and using the state system as an alternative, and it's happening because doctors will not go to residential aged-care facilities, and they've made that clear. Residents of those facilities are then being transferred to the hospitals. I have heard that from people that work directly in the system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nowhere are these cuts hurting more than in country Australia, where country people have fewer GPs, less choice, fewer doctors who bulk-bill and higher co-payment ratesânot to mention the travel costs they incur. There are seven million people who live in country Australia. We know the chronic disease burden is much greater there and we know that, for them, getting the healthcare they need is much more difficult. Martin Laverty, the CEO of the Royal Flying Doctor Service, talks about the mental health crisis in country Australiaâand, again, time does not allow me to talk about that in detail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only last night, the member for Macarthur and I, at a function held by the Lung Cancer Foundation, spoke with a person from Mackay, who, over the years, has had multiple surgeries. Her family has had to spend a million dollars for her healthcare needs. When she goes to her GP, each visit costs her about $100 because there is no bulk-billing providedânot to mention the travel costs this person incurs to go to Brisbane every time she needs to get the serious treatment she needs. That is typical of the hardship being faced by country people when it comes to the health services provided by this nation. The facts speak for themselves. Out-of-pocket costs for remote Australians went up to $60.20 in 2017 and, for very remote Australians, to $64.25. That's the government own report figures. For specialists, the out-of-pocket cost for remote Australians is now $81. The figures don't lie. This comes from the government's own Medicare report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that a healthy nation is a productive nation. Health care comes at the top of what matters to people most, and the Morrison government, and this minister in particular, have failed to adequately manage Australia's healthcare system.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="72184" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:41</span>):  I love it when the opposition bring up these MPIs on health and make these outrageous claims. There are black-and-white budgetary figures that show that most of what has been said in the last two speeches from the other side is absolute rubbish. First of all, Medicare funding has gone up exponentially. There's another $4.8 billion going into Medicare over the next four years. Bulk-billing rates have gone from 82 per cent up to 86 per cent. That is not a reduction in Medicare billing. There is $10 billion more annually since 2013 going into Medicare billing than there was in the last final year of the ALP being in charge of health. It is unbelievable that they have the temerity to say that we've cut things in Medicare. We've established the Medicare guarantee legislation, which means that the first funds out of the budget go into Medicare funding and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme funding, and it's topped up by income tax. So there is a legislated guaranteed allocation of funds and appropriation for health first up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On hospital funding, my goodness, there has been so much more money go into state and territory hospital funding than you could realistically expect. In fact, one would say we have taken over more responsibility than any other government since Federation. Hospital funding to all the states has increased by 70 per cent since 2013. And the new hospital agreement that has just been signed up to go from 2020-21 out to the 2024-25 budgetary year will increase funding by another $30.2 billion. The states must be so pleased that they have got all these extra funds. Just so you know that I can count: $13.3 billion from the federal government in 2013 and this year it's $22.7 billion. That is a massive increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go to some of the other pillars of our health systemâfor example, health insurance. We have reformed health insurance and we've changed what can be claimed on health insurance for people in regional and rural Australia. We've given a discount to young people in order to get more young people to take up private health insurance early. You will be able to claim a travel allowance under the new scheme if you are using your private health insurance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding one of the other pillars, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, we've just heard the most up-to-date figures. There are 1,900 new or amended listings. There is $10 billion a year going into the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, of which $2.4 billion has been for new listings. Whether it is for asthma, cystic fibrosis or cancers like leukaemia, lymphoma, ovarian cancer or melanomaâyou name itâthere are new drugs there that will give hope to people who have been afflicted by serious cancers. Whether you have heart failure or hepatitis C, there are new, amazing drugs that are now on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that weren't there before. They have been listed because we have had the economic management in place to secure the funds for these vital services. We have grown the pie. We are cutting taxes. We have done so much to secure the essential services that everyone in Australia relies on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have given another 30 MRI licences. That's another bonus to the state hospitals, because some of these MRI licences will be in public hospitals. Medicare is subsidising cutting-edge radiology in state and territory public hospitals. There's another 20 MRI licences that can be tendered for. That's a 17 per cent increase. As for what we've done in mental health, there have been extra funds for mental health in the bush. Mr Laverty, the CEO of Royal Flying Doctor Service, came to us when I was in the health portfolio and said, 'We need more money for mental health.' And what did we get in the last budget? We got extra millions and millions of dollars for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. We've expanded end-to-end medical school training in regional Australia. The Medical Research Future Fund has kicked the funding into biomedical translation funds and for blue sky development of new research ideas. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:46</span>):  This government has a five-year record of failures on Medicare. I just don't have enough time to describe this government's failures on health. There was the My Health Record, the hugely increased gap payments for Medicare visits, the failure in imaging, the failure in pathology and the failure in providing services to rural and regional areas. It is an absolute tragedy. I'll just remind the minister that it was the Labor Party who introduced the bipartisan PBS in 1948, and it has been bipartisan since then. His false claims of new listingsâparticularly including generics, which we all know are not really new drugsâis just absurd.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have been in power now for five whole years. I can't emphasise this point enough. In the Federation Chamber yesterday, I highlighted this lazy government's modus operandi, whereby whenever they are criticised for one of their failures they do their utmost to blame the issues of today on a long past Labor government. I suspect we'll see and hear more of this today in the MPI. We've known for some time that those opposite have given up on governing. This is made even more obvious whenever the current Prime Minister speaks. He is obsessed with us and our fight for fairness. Rather than positively contributing to policy debate, he and his entire team merely try to smear us when things don't go their own way. After the 2016 election, those oppositeâdespite emerging victoriousâcould be heard day in and day out, crying and whining like toddlers, about a campaign about health they couldn't understand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During my allotted time, I think it will become quite apparent to all those who listen that the opposition is right to publicly fight for and defend the integrity of our beloved Medicare system, which was introduced by the Labor Party. It's apposite that we mention the name of Professor John Deeble, who died recently. He was one of the fathers of Medicare, with Dr Dick Scotton. All present here know that it was under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government that the Medicare freeze has been extended for over five years. It was their horrid 2014 budget which saw this freeze continue and, indeed, it continues on today. This has resulted in $3 billion being ripped out of Medicare. They also wanted a Medicare co-payment which would damage and prevent health care for the most disadvantaged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a doctor. I still do a volunteer clinic at my local hospital, and I have many friends who presently practise in their respective medical fields. So I would suggest that those opposite listen closely to what I'm saying. They might learn a thing or two.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have sat on the treasury bench, and whilst they've done that we've seen gap costs for specialists absolutely skyrocket. For example, seeing a cardiologist now can cost patients almost $500 out of pocket. There's been a collapse of the public hospital outpatient system. And the policies of those opposite have resulted in Australian patients having to front higher and higher out-of-pocket expenses, including things like pregnancy ultrasounds, which I've seen patients avoid because they couldn't afford the gap payment. People are having to pay more for GP visits, blood tests, X-rays and other consultations. Australians are forgoing undertaking the medical treatment they require, because they cannot afford it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is Australia. It's not the United States. However, we are very rapidly developing a two-tiered system. I might mention IVF therapies. IVF therapies are now out of the range of most lower income Australians. This is a two-tiered system. Imaging is another field which sees patients paying higher and higher gap costs. There exists a massive divide between those in metropolitan areas and those who reside in rural and regional areas. Those who live in country towns and in the bush have had their access to high-quality health care restricted by costs, and medical treatment is simply becoming unobtainable for some people. Those opposite do not seem to grasp the importance of this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In almost every aspect of health care you can look at, the Liberal and National government are failing. They come in here and they self-promote about listing medications, without really understanding the fact that we are now developing a two-tiered medical system in Australia. It is an evolving tragedy. If they do not understand it, they need to take a few lessons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet another example of this government's failure is the blowout we've seen in waiting lists, in particular in the public hospital system. I hold the Prime Minister responsible for a cut of well over $3 million to my hospital in my electorate of Macarthur. Prime Minister, I'd like that funding back because it is desperately needed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:51</span>):  Deary me, it's Thursday afternoon, and we know what it's like. It's the end of a sitting periodâtwo weeks. The call goes out from the whip's office or the Leader of the Opposition, saying, 'Can somebody come up with a subject that this opposition can talk about that's a matter of public interest?' They scratch around, looking under every surface, speaking to every shadow minister, who is visionless with any possible policy. They turn around to the shadow minister who has to deal with housing and say, 'Could we do a matter of public importance on housing?' Then someone says, 'Actually, we can't do that, because we're actually proposing a policy that would lead to 42,000 fewer homes being built and housing becoming a shortfall.' Then they scratch around and they say, 'What about if we take concern for senior Australians?' Then they go: 'No, actually we've got another problem. We're going around and raiding people's full tax refunds.' So they can't do that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eventually they get to the member for Ballarat, our favourite shadow minister, the shadow minister for health. She says: 'I know. I've got a brilliant idea. Let's do a matter of public importance on this government's five-year record on Medicare.' And they think it's genius, because they start by saying we should be afraid of the campaign they ran at the last election. We all know that at the last election the opposition lied. They lied big time. The opposition lied. And what we haveâ</span>

We know that the GP bulk-billing rate has gone up to 86.1 per cent, from 82.2 per cent in Labor's last year in government. Apparently, that was a success that they were prepared to own. But, when you increase it and deliver more for the Australian people, they declare it a failure somehow. They have the most appalling metrics. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  I rise today in support of the matter of public importance before this House, and I do so because Labor, on this side, believes in investing in health care so that all Australians can access services of the best possible quality. In this matter of public importance, it is important to highlight the failures of the government. All we have to do is look back at the 2013 federal election, when the then leader, the member for Warringah, said publicly, on TV, a few nights before the election, 'There will be no cuts to health,' and he pledged to continue Labor's fifty-fifty hospital funding arrangement. But in his government's first budgetâthe very first budgetâthey tore up Labor's agreement, ripped it to shreds, not honouring the promise that he had made a few months earlier, and reverted to the previous, failed funding systemâthe failed formula that resulted in a $57 billion cut to hospitals across Australia. You cannot take $57 billion out and expect the hospital and healthcare system to operate in a way that provides good, proper health care to Australians. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've heard from colleagues, Labor believe in a universal health system. We were the ones that invented it. We were the ones that brought it to parliament on two occasions. On the first occasion, it was ripped down by the Fraser government. When Hawke came back as Prime Minister, a Labor government reintroduced itâand again the now government opposed it. They voted against it that time as well. We know it's in the government's DNA. It's in their DNA to rip down Medicare if they can. We certainly know this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last federal election, if we hadn't spoken out, if we hadn't challenged them, they would have privatised Medicare. The only reason they haven't done it so far is that we on this side have defended it year after year after year. It's been defended by us because we believe in it. You don't believe in it. That's the difference. The reality is that, after the 2013 election, you tried to water it down by bringing in the co-payment for GPs. It didn't work, so you went through the back door. The back door was to put a freeze on doctor's payments. So you had already sown the seeds in 2014 for people not to trust you when it came to Medicare, for the Australian public not to trust this Liberal government. And nor should they, when they look at your track record.</span>

Those opposite wanted to bring in a co-payment where pensioners would be expected to pay $5 more for their medicines. Not only that; today we saw a report in the paper that said they actually are privatising parts of Medicare by bringing in contract workers to work in Medicare offices. It might not be a direct privatisation but it is creeping in, and they would love to creep it in all the way and privatise it. Their agenda has been to privatise Medicare from back in the Whitlam days, when they abolished it, and the Hawke days, when they opposed it. Every change that we bring in to better it, they oppose it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's much more I could go on with. For example, we know that the government ripped down the 50-50 hospital funding agreementâthey tore up Labor's agreementâand made a further $10.4 billion in cuts to Medicare and other health programs, including the dental care program that Labor brought in. They ripped that up and threw it away immediately. They tried to bring in a $7 GP co-payment. It is in this government's DNA to water Medicare down, to bring it down, to do everything they can not to have a good, universal system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the chamber believe in a universal system. We believe that everyone should have access to good health care. We also believe that everyone can visit their GP if they're not feeling well and want tests. Those on that side of the chamber want us to present our credit card, not our Medicare card. It's quite obvious.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms that this side of politics, the Labor Party, fought for throughout the seventies and eighties to ensure we have a system in place that looks after everyoneâthey are what we on this side are defending. That's what we defended in the 2016 election campaign, and we'll continue to do so in this place, because Australians deserve a good healthcare system.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  Before I commence my contribution to the discussion on this matter of public importance, can I acknowledge the contributions of the member for Lyne and the member for Macarthur in their private lives. I think it is important to recognise the dedication they have had to the health system, as specialists, and to all those people out there who are less fortunate, who are ill and need assistance. To the member for Macarthur, in particular: as a parent who's spent plenty of time with sick children in the rooms of a local paediatrician, I acknowledge that it's a very difficult role and I congratulate you on the work that you have done over your lifetime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are here for a political debate, obviously, and unfortunately those opposite are looking to make mileage out of things that are untrue. We know that in the 2016 campaign, the 'Mediscare' campaign, they quite simply made it up. They thought they could go into an election campaign and take an opportunity to scare people who were vulnerableâseniors or others concerned about their healthâon something that was completely untrue. In fact, my wife got a text message on her mobile, on the day of the election, saying that we were making massive changes to Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's happened? Has that happened? It has not. In fact, we've legislated the Medicare Guarantee Act, so those opposite know there has been a piece of legislation put through this House which will guarantee Medicareâguarantee it! Yet still they sit on that side and say that there are cuts. They must be Edward Scissorhands over thereâeverything I hear is 'cut, cut, cut'. The reality is that that is just not the case. We have increased federal funding for public hospitals from $13.3 billion in 2013-14 to $22.7 billion in 2020-21. That's a 70 per cent increase.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PITT:</span>
                  </a>  I'll take that interjectionâit's a reverse cut. I'm fairly confident that 70 per cent is bigger than 10 per cent, bigger than 20 per cent, bigger than 50 per cent. It's even bigger than 60 per cent. I know there are some over there who have education outside of being union organisers and all those types of things. They know that a 70 per cent increase is an increase. It's not a cut, it's not a decrease; it is an increase in funding. So we have guaranteed Medicare through the Medicare Guarantee Act and we have increased federal funding to the health system for public hospital services. But there are some challenges out there. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know that I'm a passionate Queenslander and, unfortunately, Annastacia Palaszczuk, the Labor Premier of Queensland, is refusing to sign up to the national partnership agreement. Not only that but, in my electorate, in the area of Wide BayâI have Hinkler and my next door neighbour is Wide Bay, but the area is generically known as Wide Bayâstate Labor cut nearly $4 million in the last year alone, 2016-17 to 2017-18, and, at the time, our contribution increased by $25 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have a state government in Queensland that are cutting funding to health services. We are trying to increase funding to health services. Across the board, it is a 70 per cent increase, and yet we have a state Labor government that will not sign up to the national partnership agreement; they just will not. There are billions of dollars that can help our people, the people we represent, just like those opposite. I say to those opposite from state Labor in Queensland: get in there, convince Palaszczuk to sign the national partnership agreement. It is in all of our interests. We are ready to provide that funding. It is much better for us; it is much better for our constituents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear all the noise around Medicare. I've got to say, in my electorate of Hinkler in 2012-13 our local GP bulk-billing data showed there were 768,076 individual services bulk-billed. In 2017-18, that is now 944,174. That is a substantial increase in the number of services provided to the people in my electorate. In fact, it is up by 167,098. So I say to those opposite: stop trying to make political mileage out of things that don't exist; stop making up numbers; stop suggesting to those vulnerable people who are concerned about health services that there are cuts when they are not. We know that the Labor state Premier in Queensland is not signing the agreement. We know that they've taken money out of my electorate and others across the state. On this side, we will continue to deliver. Those on the opposite side will not.</span>

One in five of us is aged under 15 and one in five of us is aged over 65. The youngest and the oldest in our community have the biggest need for affordable health care, and this government has let them down. Vulnerable people in our communityâthe old and the youngâhave been let down by this government. This month, Mental Health Awareness Month, I stand here as a pharmacist who worked in the mental health in-patient units at my local hospital in Wyong for almost 10 years. The strain on patients, the strain on carers and the strain on families because of the lack of mental health services in regional and remote communities is growing. It's at crisis point.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0H" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAMING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  From this debate, we can identify a commonality on the importance of mental health. But, at this point, when you reach the end of a sitting week and you have yet another health and hospital debate driven by the Labor Party, absolutely determined to pillory private health provisionârecognising about half of the entire Australian health systemâit's really, really disappointing that there can't be bipartisan agreement on private and public delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, of course, the best way to identify whether a party that is in opposition would do an even better job than the government is to have a look at how the Labor Party is performing in states where they do control the hospital system. And it's not a pretty picture in Queensland. I'd like to devote a little bit of time to what is happening in the great state of Queensland, where we'd be hoping that ramping wouldn't be happening and that people with mental health issues would be getting the care they need, where it's actually in the hands of the Labor Party to fix it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no news more recent than the news right today on page 4 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Courier Mail</span> that recognises some of the areas in Queensland with appalling waits, appalling ramping, loss of hospitals beds and an inability to even meet national benchmarks for hospital performance. I think that the remaining people in the gallery would concur; they would probably say that the performance of their local hospital system, wherever they live around this great nation, doesn't change much between Liberal and Labor. They don't notice any particular difference between one party that trumpets that they invented the PBS in 1948 and a party that trumpets that they invented Medicare in the mid-seventies. We're not disputing health history. We're not disputing the actions of Menzies and those who came before him. It's about whether the people in the chamber can get the help they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland, of course, we've got a health minister with a PhDâand that's promising! The PhD is in 'union renewal'. And if you look up the Wikipedia page for the state health minister of Queensland, there is just one simple sentence, and I think I could distil it onto a postage stamp. It says, 'Steven Miles ran campaigns to improve rights at work' as his grounds for being a health minister. And his entire pre-political career is a single line in Wikipedia saying that he used to run campaigns to save penalty ratesâa job he did so well they gave it to the Fair Work Commission to do after he left! That is the sum total of the experience of the person running Queensland's health system. So it's no wonder that, when we look at the kids' hospital in Queensland, we see the Queensland state Labor government ripping funding out of the kids' hospital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What do they do with the funding? You'd like to know how they'd run the health system. They tear down the name 'Lady Cilento' from the children's hospital, spending half a million dollars on rebranding, taking off this great woman's name from the hospital on the pretext having a female's name on the hospital might make you think it's private, and that causes confusion to ambulances. Only a kilometre away you've got the Princess Alexandra Hospital. How on earth is that causing confusion that the hospital may not be a public hospital? They spent half a million dollars on this ultimate insult to Lady Cilento. Nodding over there on the other side is the member for Macarthur, extension 2311, and the member for DobellâI respect a pharmacist in this place; a doctor never wants to get a pharmacist offside, does he? The problem is they don't listen to either of you. They ignore you in making policy on the Labor side. If they listened, we'd be in a far better place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've got a Queenslander unable to run a hospital, unable to resist ripping a name off the kid's hospital, out of a political vendetta against a woman who fought for family planning, who recognised the role of vitamin D, but, noâshe is not good enough for her name to stay on the hospital. It is a complete insult to rip her name off a hospital after she's been bipartisanly recognised as a great contributor. She is from Adelaide. She studied and trained in South Australia, but she is not good enough to have her name on the hospital. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a consistent pattern. In MRI, they are happy to dribble out the MRI licences for political need. When Redcliffe hospital needs an MRI licence, all they have to do is fill out an application form. Is Labor going to do it? No way. Why? They would rather take the Labor commitment of an MRI than actually apply for it through the normal channels. You've got the Redcliffe state hospital held to ransom, saying, 'Vote Labor, or you'll get no MRI, because we as the state government aren't going to apply for it.' This is the annoyingâno, disappointingâconduct of a state government that can't even run the system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not going to talk to you about funding, because those on the other side do not even understand numbers. They don't understand that $23 billion is bigger than $13 billion. There's no point reading numbers to that side of parliament. What's true is that you can't run a great health system without a great economy that funds the needs of a growing ageing population and a more technologically based health system. You will always get, on this side, an absolute guarantee to increase health funding and to list drugs when they are approved and not when you feel like that. That's why people trust us in health care.</span>

                </a>  I do. I was misrepresented by the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in the House on 15 August, 2018. The former Prime Minister alleged that in the course of the recent Mayo by-election, I'd made $700 million worth of promises. This is completely untrue. I tested this allegation through a question in writing, referred to as question No. 1054, in response to the current Prime Minister. He did not provide any evidence of how or where I made such a commitment, or what such a commitment was for. He merely stated that commitments made by other candidates are matters for other candidates. As a candidate and now returned member who did not make any commitments to the value of $700 million, I formally request the Prime Minister set the record straight and withdraw the comment that I made any such commitment, as it is quite clearly untrue.</span>

Ultimately, it was a disappointing outcome that we couldn't reach agreement with Mr Quaedvlieg regarding this matter.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="263328" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HUSAR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  We are currently facing a housing crisis in this country. The cost of living is rising, and wages have not been this stagnant since the release of <span style="font-style:italic;">Jurassic Park</span> in 1998. This government's solution is to tell low-income earners that, if they ever want to be able to afford housing, they need to stop eating smashed avocado. The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017 outlines the government's perception that there is a need to create a system for the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme. This scheme will be applied to public- and community-housing tenants who rely on income support or family assistance payments. This government is victimising individuals and families who are already struggling with this government's out-of-touch attacks on low-income earners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I bet the people who are behind this bill have never gone to the letterbox and felt their stomach turn, never experienced the fear or the dread of opening that bill for fear that they won't be able to make the rent on time from having to pay something that lands unexpectedly. They've never had to make the choice between eating and paying rent. I use the word 'choice' because it is a human right that these people are attempting to take away from people who are affected by the outcomes of this bill. The basic dignity of being able to decide if you can pay your bills, buy groceries or replace school shoes is something that people who need income support value.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would introduce the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme. Under the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme, everyone who receives an income support payment or family tax benefit and lives in public or community housing could have their payment withheld by Centrelink and paid directly to their housing provider. What concerns me, though, is the ability for people to choose to manage their own already limited finances and make decisions that potentially impact their day-to-day lives. This bill will allow states, territories and community housing providers to withhold a portion of the tenants' income support payments and use those funds to directly pay the rent, utilities and other costs relating to the dwelling on behalf of those tenants. It will enable providers to do this with family tax benefits also.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes changes also to the administration of the National Rental Affordability Scheme by removing the ambiguity in relation to the calculation of below-market rents in a given year, providing flexibility in the way that maximum periods of vacancy are prescribed, and authorising the variation of conditions to allocation and the transfer of allocations to low-rent dwellings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we were last in government, we tried to introduce an automatic rent deduction scheme. The purpose of that, though, was to protect vulnerable individuals who were at risk of homelessness, and it was targeted in its scope. The government's scheme, on the other hand, according to the National Social Security Rights Network, proposes a very broad management scheme for social housing which ignores the very complex nature and causes of homelessness. I have incredibly serious concerns about how this government's plans will affect social-housing tenants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also have concerns about how this will affect victims of domestic violence. Seventy-two thousand women sought homelessness services in the 2016-17 financial year due to family violence. This alone should paint a worrying picture about the very real and tangible risk of further pushing women into housing stress and poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people ask me: is housing a women's issue? The trends indicate that women are retiring more and more frequently into housing stress. Of women over 55 in the low- to middle-income group, more than 640,000 women, 15 per cent are already in housing stress and over half a million are likely to come into housing stress moving forward. For those women who are accessing homelessness services, those in the over-55 category have increased by four per cent, and women over 65 have increased by 11 per cent. This is four times the general housing population. Gendered housing analysis shows that there are two key areas: firstly, housing access needs of older womenâaffordable housing close to transport and/or medical servicesâand, secondly, women exiting houses where there is violence, who may leave with children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">Filthy Rich and Homeless</span>, which aired on ABC on 14 August as part of a three-part series, told a story of too many Australians being pushed to the fringes and finding themselves in need of housing assistance. They followed the case of Selvi, a woman who lives in Kingswood in my electorate. She's a single mum to three small children. She found herself homeless after separating from her partner and has been living in temporary accommodation in transitional housing. Domestic violence is the lead cause of homelessness for women in Australia, and the reforms we have seen in my state of New South Wales do nothing whatsoever to address what we already know is happening In her part of the documentary, Selvi spoke of her struggle to find a permanent place for her family to call home and of approaching the private market and getting knockback after knockback because she's a single mum. Moreover, it's because affordability of private rentals is a pathetic one per cent. One per cent of private rental homes are affordable for those on low incomes. Selvi spoke of the agonising multi-year wait and multi-year waiting times for emergency housing from the Department of Housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the best place for children and young people is in a stable home. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government has ignored those on the fringes. It's now been five years. They have turned their back on so many vulnerable people in Lindsay and in communities right across Australia, doing nothing other than demonising those who can't find a home. I can't imagine what it would be like to be in Selvi's position. I'm a mum and I have three kids my own. But raising three children in temporary accommodation must be absolutely heart-wrenching for her as a mum. She's doing the best she can and she's incredible. Her determination to get out of that situation is commended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on the other side think that this isn't a real issue. They often make light of it. I can't rememberâand I don't care to rememberâwhich one of them it was, because it is a reflection on all of them over there. They are making light of the situation we find our country in. They are telling people they can afford a house if they get rich parents, stop eating smashed avocado or simply get a better job. How can this government look at people like Selvi and her three children and call that a solution? They were out of touch under Turnbullâwho didn't even live in the Prime Minister's residence because his own home was too plumbâthey were out of touch under Abbott and they are still out of touch now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Between 2011 and 2016 the number of people experiencing homelessness in New South Wales increased by 37 per cent. In the city of Sydney, it increased by 48 per cent, which is far higher than the nationwide increase of 14 per cent. This increase is due to the lack of affordable housing. There are 60,000 applicants on the social housing waiting list in New South Wales and less than one per cent of private rentals are affordable for them. There's a need to identify specialist housing services to support women who are exiting violence. Housing organisations have expressed concerns about the arbitrary nature of the scheme that is proposed to be introduced by this bill depriving tenants of the flexibility to respond to upcoming financial obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's scheme would have exempted deductions for compensation made for damage caused by others, including as a result of domestic or family violence. The government's bill, as it stands, could mean that a tenant experiencing family or domestic violence could be liable for the damage caused by the perpetrator. We do not support a mandatory automatic rent deduction scheme for all public and social housing tenants; only when we are aiming to prevent homelessness should we apply automatic rent deductions. We will keep this Liberal government accountable, and we will ensure that we move amendments in the Senate to make sure that those who are most vulnerable, those individuals who are in arrears, are not at risk of being left on the street without a place to liveâleft behind by this government. We'll move an amendment to cap the maximum deduction to prevent the scheme from forcing people into housing distress and to make sure people have money to meet other needs and pay other bills as they arise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will move amendments to require that compulsory deductions can be made for rent and utilities and not property damage. This is to protect people from being unfairly held responsible for somebody else's actions in the case of domestic and family violence. Currently 86 per cent of public and social housing tenants use the rent deduction scheme. At the moment, some social housing tenants are also income support recipients and they can choose to have the Department of Human Services withhold a portion of their fortnightly payment and pay it directly to their housing provider to cover rent and some bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an absolute shame to see young people in this country being locked out of the housing market under this government. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government can't be trusted to deliver housing reform, let alone something like we need to see in this sector. The government needs to have a clear focus and focus their energy on clawing back the income that oversees investors are taking from our nation and the housing market.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245392" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  This year we are celebrating 30 years of this new Parliament House and the last sittings in what was always intended to be the provisional Parliament House, which we now know as Old Parliament House. So it is fitting that we recognise the service, now more than 30 years, of the only member of this parliament who also served in the old Parliament House, the Hon. Warren Snowdon, the member for Lingiari. Warren was first elected as the member for the Northern Territoryâthe Territory only had one seat back thenâin 1983. In his first speech, Warren said he would be 'strident' in his efforts to represent the interests of all Territoriansâand he has fulfilled his promise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his first speech, Warren thanked his partner Elizabeth for her support. Elizabeth had in fact given birth to their first child, Frances, during that election campaign. Warren and Elizabeth now have four children, Frankie, Tom, Tess and Jack. Warren's family knows better than most people the sacrifices that he and they have made with him representing the Northern Territory and now the seat of Lingiari for 30 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Warren also said in his first speech that he would work for the formal recognition of Aboriginal Australians and for compensation for their lands stolen and the disruptions to their society and culture. He has worked tirelessly in this place and in his own electorate to ensure that First Nations people are better represented and that the broad disadvantage experienced by First Nations people around the country is confronted and improved. He has worked to ensure that all governments in this place do not forget that we still have a long way to go in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Warren's parliamentary record demonstrates his breadth of interests, his hard work in many policy areas, and his achievements as a parliamentary secretary and minister in a range of portfoliosâTransport and Communications; Employment, Education and Training; Environment, Sport and Territories; Defence Science and Personnel; Â Â Â Indigenous Health and Rural and Regional Health; and Veterans Affairs, including the Centenary of Anzac. Warren did much of the planning for that great representation of our deep thanks for the sacrifices of those Australians in the First World War. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Warren's parliamentary record is a great one, but it's his record as a champion for the Territory and the Northern Territory's people that I want to emphasise here. Warren represents Lingiari, a huge electorateâalmost twice the size of New South Wales. The sheer size of this electorate means that it is not like representing constituents in any seat, really, except for save a couple. The travel and commitment this representation takes is admirable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a person, Waz is passionate. He's a fierce advocate for those who don't have a voice and a good mate to so many, including myself. He's also a person of great empathy. He understands that people are at the centre of everything we do here. This is so important for the design of meaningful policies and it's why Warren has made such great contributions throughout his career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout his 30 years of parliamentary service, Warren has given voice to Australians in the most remote parts of our nation on so many issues and given voice to the oldest continuous culture on earth and to some of the most disadvantaged people in our country. Within the Parliament, Waz has been a team player, putting the interests of his friends and colleagues before himself. In this way, he has always embodied the Labor ideals of equity and fairness. Warren has been a mentor to me and has taught me a great deal about serving the people of Darwin and Palmerston, learning about their needs and helping them. We now work together to deliver for Palmerstonâsome suburbs of which have been added to Warren's electorateâand together we work for the Northern Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's still plenty that Warren is working on and is so passionate about, including the Indigenous health plan implementation, northern regional development and veterans' affairs. That's always been important to him as the son of a World War II veteran. It's a privilege for me to recognise Warren's 30 years of service to the electorate of Lingiari, the Northern Territory and also our nation. In closing, I just want to say thank you to the member for Lingiari. Thank you, Wazza.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="203092" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZIMMERMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  I rise today to acknowledge a number of significant events and major milestones in my electorate. This month our community will be celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Royal North Shore Hospital. It was on Friday 30 October, 1885, when a public meeting was held not far from where the hospital stands today to discuss the idea of establishing a local hospital to give the people of the North Shore much-needed and better access to health services. And so, just a year later, on 18 June, 1888, Willoughby became home to a modest cottage hospital which was to grow to become the Royal North Shore Hospital and become one of New South Wales' and, indeed, Australia's leading health precincts. The hospital has served members of the local and broader Sydney community diligently and with incredible care ever since.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017, for example, the Royal North Shore Hospital had more than 80,000 emergency department presentations, including 19,000 by ambulance, and more than 500,000 outpatient services. Royal North Shore Hospital is also a tertiary teaching hospital and a principal tertiary referral centre. It provides statewide services for severe burn injuries, neonatal intensive care and spinal cord injury treatment. The hospital is also the home of the Kolling Institute of Medical Research, which does such outstanding work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Royal North Shore Hospital is part of the Northern Sydney Local Health District, and I'm pleased the federal government has been increasing funding for all 10 hospitals in the district. In fact, funding has been increased by our government by some $235 million, or 104 per cent, since we were elected. State and federal support will ensure it continues to be one of Sydney's pre-eminent hospitals. But, at its heart, the Royal North Shore Hospital has the trust of those in need of care because of the outstanding doctors, nurses and ancillary staff who work at the hospital. To them, and all associated with the hospital, I say congratulations on 130 years of outstanding service to our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate is home to over 5,000 people of Indian ancestry, and they are making a wonderful contribution to our community. This time of year is a special one for the Hindu, Sikh, Jain and Newar Buddhist communities as families come together to celebrate the festival of Diwali. The five-day Diwali festival celebrates good over evil and light over dark. It is therefore a festival marked by light and colour in ways that mark the vibrancy of Indian heritage and culture, as we have learned to expect and respect. I saw this evident in our own local Diwali celebration which was recently held in Chatswood. Organised by AVSAR, a group that is committed to improving Indian cultural awareness on the lower North Shore, the festival brought together some of the best of Indian food and cultural performances. The festival serves as a reminder of the wonderful multicultural community I have the honour of representing in this parliament, and I congratulate the organisers for such a successful day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs is present this afternoon because I know that he is such a keen supporter of the Indian community in Sydney and no doubt will be celebrating Diwali on several occasions over the month ahead. To all my constituents celebrating, I say, 'Shubh Diwali,' and I hope the festival is a happy time for you and your families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I also want to acknowledge and thank the organisers of the Crows Nest and Lane Cove festivals which recently took place in my electorate. Now in its 29th year, the Crows Nest Festival attracts 50,000 people, who enjoy the stalls, food and entertainment which are at its core. Stretching along Willoughby Road and its neighbouring side street, the festival brings together residents of all ages and is undoubtedly one of the biggest on the North Shore, if not Sydney. I particularly congratulate the Crows Nest Mainstreet committee, North Sydney council and local and corporate sponsors for once again making the festival such an outstanding event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, despite the threat of rain, this year's Lane Cove Fair was a huge success. There were an extensive number of interesting stalls that showcased local business, an impressive variety of food, great kids' rides and wonderful music on offer throughout the day. The Rotary Club of Lane Cove helps organise the fair and proceeds assist Rotary's incredible work, its support for local, national and international programs, and Rotary projects undertaken across Australia and overseas. Congratulations to the Rotary Club of Lane Cove and the Lane Cove Council for all their work on putting together such a great community event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A highlight of both festivals was my own jellybean guessing competitionâwell, maybe not! But I do want to congratulate the two young winners, Lily Dean from Crows Nest and Hazel Choi from Lane Cove. Their parents will be delighted to know the prize wasn't all 460-odd jellybeans, but instead a book voucher. Both events have the common goal of bringing the community together and also supporting local businesses. Both events more than achieve this important goal.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  I rise to speak about inequality. In 2016 the member for Maribyrnong said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">As long as 2.5 million Australians live below the poverty line, and one out of every four are children. â¦ We cannot say the fair go belongs to all.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Inequality is not just about income or wealth. It's also about opportunity and access: the opportunity to get a good education, access to affordable health care, access to secure well-paid local jobs, the opportunity to own your own home, access to care and support if you are living with a disability, and access to good quality aged care when you need it later in life. Inequality doesn't just hold back individuals; it holds back everybody.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent report by the Productivity Commission, <span style="font-style:italic;">Rising inequality? A stocktake of the evidence</span>, notes that while economic mobility in Australia is high some Australians experience entrenched economic disadvantage. Why, in a wealthy country like Australia today, are one in four single women over 60 living in poverty, with many at risk of homelessness? Why is a young motherâwho I met at her appointment with a financial counsellor, after leaving family violenceâstruggling to find $460 a week to keep her private rental so that her three children have a home, while juggling child care and her casual cleaning job? Why is a grandmotherâwho I met in Bateau Bay; while on a surgery waiting list, she had been bumped that morningâhousing her adult son in her garage because, after his partner died, he was no longer on the priority housing list?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the commission:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Persistent and recurrent poverty affects a small, but significant proportion of the population. About three per cent of Australians (roughly 700 000 people) have been in income poverty continuously for at least the last four years. People living in single-parent families, unemployed people, people with disabilities and Indigenous Australians are particularly likely to experience income poverty, deprivation and social exclusion. For people in these circumstances, there is an elevated risk of economic disadvantage becoming entrenched, limiting their potential to seize economic opportunities or develop the skills with which to overcome these conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this same subject, a recent report by UnitingCare Australia and NATSEM, <span style="font-style:italic;">Child social exclusion, poverty and disadvantage in Australia</span>, shows that many children are experiencing multiple types of disadvantage, leading to social exclusionâlike the young children of the mum who I referred to earlier, who was with the financial counsellor while fleeing family violence and at risk of homelessness, or the grandmother who I met at The Entrance, who is now is raising her four grandchildren. The report found that housing stress limits access to education and health care and that reliance on low-paid, insecure work places enormous pressure on these families and their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This matters and we need to do something about it. On our side, we have a plan to grow the economy and make sure that nobody is left behind. We will restore funding to schools and hospitals so that everyone has access to the essential services they need. As a pharmacist who worked in mental health inpatient units at my local hospital in Wyong for the last 10 years before this job, I saw the strain put on patients, their carers and their families due to the cuts to health services, particularly in mental health. On our side we will work to ease the cost-of-living pressures. We will stand up for working people, strengthening industrial relation systems to make sure that every worker has a secure job and secure employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that every child, wherever they were born or wherever they grow up, should have the opportunity to meet their potential. The evidence is overwhelming that children who miss out on early years of learning, often those children from disadvantaged backgrounds, are the ones who would benefit most from our preschool program. That's why we've committed to permanent, ongoing funding for the National Preschool and Kindy Program for four-year-olds and will extend that cover to three-year-olds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will also remove the NDIA staff cap, freeing the agency to make the best long-term decisions about how they deliver quality services to Australians with disabilities. The most vulnerable in our communityâthe young, the aged, those living with disability, Indigenous people and those living with mental health conditionsâneed to be protected. We need to make decisions that are in the interests of those individuals and the interests of all Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HK5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  On Saturday, 24 November Victorians have an opportunity to address the real issues that are facing them in the state. Those issues include the congestion on the roads; the crime rate, which is out of hand in parts of Melbourne and other places in Victoria; and, indeed, the cost of living. The Victorian Liberal-National opposition, led by my friend and state parliamentary colleague Matthew Guy have already announced a series of policies to address these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are policies to deal with congestion, including building the biggest connected highway in Victoria's history, the East West Link, which is important to constituents of your electorate, Mr Speaker, as well as mine, and the North East Link; building the biggest traffic-congestion-busting project in Victoria's history; a $4.1 billion to $5.3 billion infrastructure project to remove traffic lights and roundabouts through grade separations at 55 of Melbourne and Geelong's busiest and most dangerous intersections; and building the high-speed European-style rail network across Victoria, which will take some of the pressure off the growth in Melbourne in particular. We know that, already with a population of five million people and growing at 2,700 people a week, which is an equivalent of 140,000 extra Victorians each year, congestion is a major problem so far as Victorians are concerned. These sorts of projects, which would be implanted by a Liberal-National government in Victoria, would make a big difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of crime, there are policies of mandatory minimum sentences for repeat violent criminals of 11 serious crimes, including murder, rape, aggravated home invasions, carjackings, one-punch hits and aggravated burglaries. An overhaul has been announced of our bail system to ensure that the most violent and dangerous offenders aren't immediately put back on the street. That includes the introduction of a presumption of remand for those charged with violent offences, the introduction of the 'one strike and you're out' policy for anyone breaching bail and the reinstatement of the offence of breaching bail by juveniles. In addition to that, there are 'community policing and protection for the safety of our local community' policies, which have been announced by the Liberal-National opposition in Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, there are policies in relation to education, such as the abolition of the political Safe Schools Program, to be replaced by an actual antibullying program targeting all aspects of discrimination to ensure that kids in schools in Victoria can learn safely and happily. There's the scrapping when it comes to the cost of living, or the Victorian Renewable Energy Target, to help stop electricity costs from continuing to skyrocket for homes and businesses throughout Victoria. Speak to any home owner, as you know, Mr Speaker, in Victoria or any small-business operator and one of the things that they'll immediately mention unprompted to you is the spiralling costs of electricity for their homes or their businesses. Therefore, the policy to allow the onshore conventional-gas exploration and production would also help to keep a downward pressure on electricity and power prices and gas prices in Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are some of more than 100 policies that have now been announced by the Liberal-National Party in Victoria, and, as I said, these are aimed squarely at the real issues facing the people of Victoriaâthe congestion on the roads and the public transport, the crime spate which has occurred in various parts of Victoria and, indeed, the cost-of-living pressures. So a vote on 24 November for Matthew Guy and his team is a vote to make some real change in Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had the pleasure over the last few weeks of being out with a number of candidatesâwith Nick McGowan in Eltham; with Monica Clark in Ivanhoe and her launch just recently; down at Narre Warren with Vikki Fitzgerald; and in Bentleigh with Asher Judah. I hope to also be able to help out with Brad Rowswell in Sandringham. These are candidates who have got the future of Victoria in their sights, who want to do things which will make Victoria an even better place to live than it is at the present time and who are working as hard as they can to respond to the issues that Victorians have been raising with them and with us over many weeks and months now. As I said, Victorians have an opportunity on 24 November to make a real difference in terms of the future of the state. A vote for Matthew Guy and his team will ensure that we have a much stronger, more prosperous Victoria in the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  Last month, the voice of sport in Canberra switched off his microphone for the last time. Today I rise to honour Canberra sports journalist Tim Gavel and his incredible career. Both Tim and his wife, Jenny, join us in the chamber this afternoon, in the gallery up there, and I'd like to welcome them both. It's very lovely to be talking about you and honouring you today with the member for Fenner also here with me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to sport, Tim Gavel is a jack-of-all-tradesâbut, unlike the saying, he's a master of pretty much all of them. Over a 30-year career, he's commentated just about everything: Rugby League, Rugby Union, horseracing, AFL, soccer, netball, rowing, basketball, swimming, diving, shooting, Greco-Roman wrestling and cricket, to name just a few! He's reported on seven Olympic Games, seven Commonwealth Games and the 2000 Sydney Paralympics. From the commentator's box, with the window open, he's talked us through Wallabies tests, Rugby world cups, Big Bash League, world volleyball, world rowing cups and Australian Rowing Championships. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like most great stories start, he came from humble beginnings. Tim Gavel always wanted to be a radio announcer. As a child growing up in the country New South Wales town of Condobolin he often set up his room as a makeshift studio, with egg cartons lining the walls to improve the sound. He spent the 1980s sleeping in the back of his ute while travelling across country New South Wales and Queensland searching for a jobâthe elusive job in radio. In December 1988, he joined the ABC Sports department in what he describes as a 'sink or swim' situation. Of his first job in sports radio, Tim said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ the only way I knew how to overcome my shortcomings as a sports commentator was to work harder than anybody else. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And Tim's hard work paid off. It paid off in spades. His accolades include being three-time ABC Sports Broadcaster of the Year, receiving an Order of Australia Medal in 2014 for services to broadcasting and the community, being named ACT Local Hero in 2008 for services to broadcasting and charity in Canberra, and receiving the Chief Minister's Award for services to broadcasting and the community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tim's incredible career gifted him with many stories about the reality of journalismâthe reality of sports journalism. In 1992 he was selected for his first Olympic Games coverage, in Barcelona. He recalls his big break for the Olympics:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Tim Lane, who was commentating the marathon, crossed to me as Rob De Castella crossed the line in the men's marathon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It was a huge build up, but just as I was about ask him my first question he collapsed from dehydration and was ushered into the medical centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My big moment had disappeared before my very eyes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his farewell to the ABC, Tim told a story of the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, where he'd been given a world exclusive to interview the gold-medal-winning middle-distance runner from Africa. After commencing the live televised interview, Tim quickly learned the only word that the athlete actually knew was 'yes'. So every time he asked a question the answer was yes. But Tim Gavel isn't just a sports journalist; he's an incredible diplomatâobviously, in terms of dealing with that situation!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He's also a man of considerable integrity, considerable generosity, with a great love for his family and his community. He's a patron of the Early Morning Centre, helping the homeless and disadvantaged here in Canberra. He's an ambassador for Every Chance To Play, which is an organisation helping families to pay registration fees for junior sportâvitally important to keep young Canberrans, young Australians, playing sport. He's an ambassador for Daramalan College Rowing Club. and he's associated with the Special Olympics, and Youth Care Canberra. Most importantly, he's a very loving husband to his wife, Jenny, and a devoted parent to Eske, Skinny and Meron. Of his career, Tim said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I owe a debt of gratitude to the ABC.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Never did I take my job for granted, it has been a great privilege to go to work each day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tim Gavel, it's been an honour. It's been a privilege for Canberrans to have you on our radios, to tune in on those weekends to hear your dulcet tones. Thank you for your remarkable contribution to our community. Thank you for your ongoing contribution to our community. Thank you. We commend you. We applaud you for a wonderful career and for keeping us up to date with sports and everything that's happening in that area. Thank you so much.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="18661" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BANKS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  On Monday this place was engulfed with high emotion, much love and sadness in the context of a national apology and the gut-wrenching stories of victims and survivors of child sexual abuse. Australia's heart poured out to these people. We learnt that one victim didn't want to attend the day because, he said, 'It's just politicians trying to make themselves look good.' I suspect there were many others like him who shared these very reasonable thoughts. During the national apology speeches I thought to myself: 'In 10, 20 or 30 years time I don't want any Australian to have to watch a national apology by the Australian government of the day to the children and families currently on Nauru.' I know I'm not the only member of parliament who felt this way on Monday when we looked up towards the gallery and saw the pain and anguish of those attending.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've said before: Labor's greatest shame was the 1,200 children who died at sea through weak border protection policies. We know Labor put them there and we know that the government stopped the boats and implemented and maintained strong border protection policies. But recounting all this, and combative politics between the two major parties, does little to help the children and families on Nauru.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The nexus between the children and families on Nauru and keeping the boats stopped has been overridden by the plight of sick children and our humanitarian obligation to get those children and their families off Nauru. What was a defensible argument in the past is weakened now with the current facts. The US arrangement is living proof that there has not been a resurgence of boats coming to Australia and nor will that happen through an arrangement with New Zealand. The integrity and strength of our border protection policies will remain. We could have made progress with the New Zealand solution this week, but the parties are too concerned with not backing down on their position to make concessions so that we can find a solution. The message will be clear. Our solution to this situation is that it is a one-off act of grace, a humanitarian decision, a decision that comes from our hearts. But our minds will ensure we have the capacity to maintain our secure borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as nothing surpasses the unconditional love a parent feels for their child, nothing should be stopping or delaying us getting these sick children and their families off Nauru. I ask members of this House to see this situation through the prism of a child's years, not in adult years, because childhood is fleeting. The time period of a month is enormous in a child's world. In the past few months, the political games and distractions of both parties have disgracefully played out in this place, and in the meantime the situation with sick children on Nauru has reached a crisis point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no more noble profession than that of the healthcare professional. The Hippocratic oath contains the element of 'do no harm'. We as a parliament should be grateful that in this same time period, the past few months, albeit that the voices of these children and their families were drowned out by the game playing and the delay in the New Zealand option, thousands of doctors of the Australian Medical Association and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, along with the Law Council of Australia, UNICEF and UNHCR, gave voice to these children. And for all the political games in this place, on Monday this place saw that across the political divide Australians have good hearts. On Monday our country overwhelmingly committed to keeping children safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Children are citizens of the world, and the children on Nauru are our ultimate responsibility. Long-term or indefinite detention is no place for any child. It is wrong to say these children and their families are not detained. Sure, they're not behind bars and they can walk about freely, but the denial of will, especially the will of a parent with a sick child wanting help, is a detention of their mind and their spirit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are many MPs on both sides of this House, across this House, who share my concern and passion, but many are constrained by the machinery that goes with belonging to a major party. The major parties should put aside political pointscoring, horsetrading, combative politics, trying to think of the next clever wedge or trying to work out how, in the words of that wise man who didn't attend the national apology, to make MPs themselves or their respective parties look good. Despite all the political games, this issue comes down to a simple truth: it is our humanitarian obligation to get these children and their families off Nauru.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard today from the head of the UNHCR that when he was in Nauru a little girl asked him, 'Why am I in prison?' He then tried to engage in dialogue with this little girl, and when he asked her name she immediately recited a number. That little girl has a name. That little girl has a life, and she's living in child years. Let us as a country not have to apologise to that little girl and the other children on Nauru in years to come.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  Youth Off The Streets does outstanding work in my local community, and right around the country, helping vulnerable young people turn their lives around. The young people that Father Chris Riley's charity helps have to overcome tremendous challenges, whether it be personal trauma or neglect or physical, psychological and emotional abuse the likes of which many in this place couldn't fathom. I want to acknowledge the work in my community, in Logan City, of Beny Bol and his team, a team that I spend a lot of time with and I have a lot of regard for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And given the charity's outstanding contribution, a funding announcement from the education minister on Tuesday afternoon should have been a cause for celebration. But what the minister's media release failed to mention was that it was his own government that had jeopardised the charity's future in the first place. As the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> had exposed that morning, the Liberals wanted to slash the charity's funding by $1.3 million a year. And worse than that, if you can believe it, they ordered the charity to repay $630,000 it had already received, money that had already been provisioned towards helping disadvantaged kids, including, importantly in our area, for a new school.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now this has to be, in a competitive field, one of the most despicable acts of this arrogant and out-of-touch government, even by its own abysmal standards. Of course we welcome the government's backflip, but those opposite shouldn't pretend it was anything but that: a humiliating backflip in the face of overwhelming community outrage. They didn't back down because what they had announced and proposed was wrong. They backed down because it was on the front of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span>.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With a number of my colleagues from the Labor side, I joined Father Riley and some of his school principals and his team from Youth Off The Streets, and we met with the shadow education minister, the member for Sydney. What really came through in that meeting was the devastating impact that the cuts proposed by the Liberal Party would have on the important work that Youth Off The Streets does. And I think any objective assessment of that work and the impact of that cut is that it would have been devastating for that charity and especially, and most importantly, for the vulnerable people that Youth Off The Streets helps.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cruel cut and the badly motivated backflip that followed really do go to the heart of the twisted priorities of this out-of-touch government. If you're at the top end of town, you get showered with largesse, you get handed generous tax breaks. But if you're a charity trying to help the most vulnerable kids in our community, you get a kick in the guts. That's the difference between this side and that side: we will always support vulnerable people right around the country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  This government is driving down power prices while keeping the lights on. In their 70s, Ron and Anita Mortimer, from Yerrinbool in the Southern Highlands in my electorate, are a rolled-gold example of how to keep your power bills down. They've installed power-saving light bulbs. They're putting curtains and awnings on their windows. And they've switched energy providers oftenâin fact, four times in the past four years. They swapped from Origin to AGL seven months ago because of a 25 per cent guaranteed discount for pensioners. By swapping providers, their power bill went from $670 a quarter to $493 for August 2018, and that was over some of the coldest months of the year. But what a huge effort. People like the Mortimers have been totally forgotten by the energy companies and left to fend for themselves. This kind of wrangling over prices and the confusion around energy contracts has to end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For businesses like Southern Meats, our abattoir at Goulburn, who pay an energy bill of more than $230,000 a month, there is a real impact about decisions relating to jobs and wages. That's why the Prime Minister and I announced this week a comprehensive package of measures to drive prices down for businesses and households. Firstly, we're taking a big stick to the big energy companies to stop their big rip-offs. We're banning sneaky late payments. We're forcing retailers to pass on wholesale price reductions. We're cracking down on dodgy anticompetitive practices. This will be implemented through a legislation package introduced to the parliament later this year. Secondly, we're establishing a fair price for those who don't have time to spend hours on the phone to a call centre in who knows where. This is a loyalty tax right now, because the most loyal customers have been paying the highest prices. In New South Wales these so-called standing offers can be up to $400 per year more expensive for households than alternative market offers. Thirdly, we're backing investment in reliable generation to increase competition and lower prices. Finally, we're requiring retailers to invest in reliable power generation years ahead of time to make sure we keep prices down and keep the lights on. I'll be raising this with my COAG colleagues tomorrow. Prices have been coming down in New South Wales from 1 July, but this is just the first round of improvements, and our next steps will continue to bring prices down for residents and small businesses in my electorate of Hume. We've started the work, but the onus is now on the energy companies to do their work to provide lower, fairer prices for the people of Hume.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  I speak today to the men and women of our intelligence and security services. I speak to the men and women of ASIO, I speak to the men and women of ASIS, I speak to the men and women of the ASD, I speak to the men and women of the AFP, I speak to the men and women of Victoria Police and New South Wales Police and other state and territory police forces, I speak to the men and women of Home Affairs, and I speak to the men and women of the ONI. These are acronyms to the Australian public, but they're your working environment. I say to you that it must be frustrating for you, as you labour day and night to keep Australians safe, to see what passes for political debate in our parliament today. I know much of what you've done to keep us safe and, in this place, on behalf of us all, I say thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I canvassed with officers from the AFP and ASIO the circumstances of an attempt to blow up a plane of a major airline departing Sydney in July 2017. It concerns me deeply how many Australians don't appreciate how close we came to this plane of 400 people being blown up in Australian skies. We were so very close. Had that 9/11-style event occurred, our country as we know it would have been irrevocably changed. But for your work, a very significant follow-up attack would have killed many Australians. Your work prevented that. I know from firsthand experience how men and women of Victoria Police Special Operations Group and ASIO prevented an attack on Anzac Day 2015, which had the potential to kill many people and change the way we commemorate Anzac Day forever. You prevented that, yet, other than desultory and sensationalist reporting from our media, we hear nothing about the threats that you labour mightily to combat every waking hour.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You know that I had for some months a diagram on the whiteboard of my office of what is called a hot entry by police officers, which showed how you would have interdicted and subdued a terrorist wanting to perpetrate a mass-casualty attack on a shopping centre in my area. You also know that I met with a very brave Special Operations Group officer who'd had his hand shot off in an exchange which subdued and killed a terrorist in 2017 in Brighton. But for your labours, but for your work, many more Australians would have been harmed and killed. I've run short of time about what I wanted to say. I'm here to say on behalf of us all: even though you don't read about our thanks and support for your efforts, you must know that our parliament and the people that represent you here support you and will continue to support you in your enduring efforts to keep our country safe.</span>

We're very pleased to be announcing that we've got $16.8 million in the latest round of the Regional Growth Fund. Whilst last round we got $10 million for an indoor sports facility in Mildura, the country towns that also matter are the towns of Swan Hill, Robinvale, Koondrook, Charlton, Donald, Bridgewater, Boort, Wedderburn and Pyramid Hill. This money will transform the township of Swan Hill. Swan Hill has the river and the town. This will open up access so that people will very much have the river as a connection to their town. They'll be able to walk straight from their central business district to the beautiful parks that are going to be opened up to the town of Swan Hill.</span>

In Koondrook, there will be waterfront upgrades, so lots of things along the Murray River. In Charlton, we're going to put the weir boards back so there will be water in the main street of Charlton, a beautiful part of the world. And in Donald, there'll be walking paths and barbecue areas and upgrades to the Donald River precinct. In Bridgewater On Lodden, we'll upgrade the river foreshore. It's personally satisfying. I have only become the federal member for Bridgewater in the last redistribution but that's where I went to primary school and to actually get something for my own home town straight away is very good. </span>

I've always said that you should be able to drive on a decent road, you should be able to make a mobile phone call, you should have decent education opportunities for your children and you should know that, if you're unwell, there will be a doctor. These are things that people in the cities often don't have to think about because they're there, but these are challenges for people who live in my part of the world. To actually get some funding to make our towns a better place to live, to enjoy, to spend time with your family is very satisfying.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  Madam Deputy Speaker Wicks, as you know, recentlyâlast week in factâthere was a terrible fire at the Morningside State School in my electorate. The consequence of that fire is the school has lost two 1920s buildings that couldn't be saved and they lost their music room. It was a very great shock for our entire community and, of course, for the students of the school and their parents. So many people in our local community who have been there for generations went to that school and a number of my friends went to that school. It's hard to express the impact that a school fire has on a community. But our community, as it always does, has really pulled together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to pay tribute to the wonderful school community. My next-door neighbour, in fact, the school P&amp;C president, David Furze, and his colleague Suzanne Neumann from the P&amp;C have been working incredibly hard to get the school back up and running. I wanted to thank acting principal, Sheryl Kennedy, who had only been there a few weeks when this fire happened and is having to deal with its aftermath and I want to thank Principal Michael Zeuschner from nearby Bulimba State School who has been lending a hand, and thank the wonderful principal, Linda Galloway, from Balmoral High. They have been hosting the students and this weekend they'll host the Fangtastic Fete, which is still going ahead, for the school. They have been getting wonderful support from all sorts of people, from people like the Brisbane Broncos through to Brisbane Airport and small businesses. In fact, Excel Event Equipment Hire have donated a lot of equipment to allow the school fete to go ahead this weekend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage people in the community to go along to the fete this weekend on 27 October to support the school. Kara Cook, who is the councillor, has been accepting donations for the fete at her office. She and I, and of course the honourable Di Farmer MP, a minister in the government but, most importantly, the member for Bulimba, have been working very closely together to try to make sure that we respond carefully as a community to the Morningside State School fire. Di had the Minister for Education, the honourable Grace Grace MP, at the school immediately. Grace and Di have been working very closely with the Department of Education to try to get demountables into the area and the kids back to their own school, as soon as possible. Of course, Balmoral has been wonderful but the kids want to get back to their own school. Things have been going along very well in terms of the rebuilding and the support from the community. We've all been overwhelmed by the support that the community has shown. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was lucky enough to see the grade sixers from Morningside. They were here in Canberra the day their school burned down. I was able to catch up with them at the Parliamentary Education Office, where they were participating in the wonderful role play that is done here. Those kids had a great time in Canberra. I was very pleased there was some happiness coming to them connected with school during such a terrible week. So I was very pleased to see them, to catch up with them and to encourage them to consider politics as an option in the future as well. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Personnel, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  The scourge of drug use and addiction problems in regional communities is well known, I'm sure, by members on both sides of the House. When people get to a position where they want to seek help, one of the troubling aspects for me as a local member is whether that help is available to them in their own communities. There is a shortage of residential drug rehabilitation beds in regional areas, perhaps right across Victoria, to such an extent that many in my community have had to go on long waiting lists to secure any help whatsoever. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm very proud to say that my community in East Gippsland, particularly around Bairnsdale, has taken action in its own right. The community has successfully initiated a major fundraising campaign and is now in a position where it has secured funding for the first stage of the Hope Restart Centre, which will be a residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre to be built near Bairnsdale. The land has been secured through the goodwill of the local community. A lot of the money has come from the local community but also from some philanthropic sources, and the federal government has provided $3 million to allow this facility to be established. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Groundworks have begun on the site. I've got to say that people are very excited about this opportunity, because we all understand that illicit drug use, particularly ice, can impact on any family. Right across our community we've seen the devastating impact it has had. Construction is due to start early next year and the centre is expected to receive its first clients in the second half of next year. We'll be working with people from across the Gippsland electorate, throughout East Gippsland and the La Trobe Valley. The facility will be operated by Odyssey Victoria, a well-known provider of drug rehabilitation services. Progress on this much-needed facility has come about through the vision, the hard work, the determination and the commitment of several community leaders and volunteers led by Peter and Margaret Down. They are two, let's say, older residents in the community, with a great deal of experience. They acknowledge that themselves. In their alleged retirement, they have put their time to great use in developing this centre. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a great example of the community recognising a problem, seeking to develop a solution in partnership with the government and then getting on with the job of addressing what is a significant issue right throughout the region. I want to congratulate the Bairnsdale community today. I want to congratulate the businesses that have supported the Hope Restart Centre and to recognise the enormous effort that has already gone into it. This is what people want to see from governments. They want to see governments taking action on important issues like this and working with them to deliver great outcomes for local residents. I fear that more of these services will be required across the state. I look forward to working with other parts of my electorate to secure more services to protect our young people. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Port Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  This Sunday at Colley Reserve in Glenelg I'm going to be really proud to take part in the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's One Walk for a world free of type 1 diabetes. The JDRF was founded by parents of children with type 1 diabetes, bringing together a grassroots network of parents and their children who are living with the disease. One Walk events have raised $85 million worldwide to date, but there is still so much more to be done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shanna McGrath from JDRF is a fantastic young South Australian leader. I first met Shanna at the 2012 Promise to Remember Me Campaign for JDRF's Kids in the House when she was just 15. She was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of six and has now been living with the condition for 15 years. The condition affects many aspects of Shanna's life. She always has to think about what she is eating, how she is exercising and many other things that could affect her blood sugar levels and future health. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since that 2012 visit to this house, Shanna has grown into a uniquely impressive young leader. She's the lead JDRF government advocate for my state of South Australia. She's never let diabetes hold her back. She's travelled widely, gone skydiving and even started her own small business. In August this year, she returned to Parliament House as part of the 2018 Kids in the House delegation. Although Shanna has learned to live with the condition, she still strives for a cure not just for herself but for the nearly 150,000 people living with type 1 diabetes here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shanna brought with her five-year-old Theodore Aslanidis and his mother, Julie, from my electorate of Port Adelaide. Theodore was diagnosed in September last year when he was just four years of age. This was a scary, difficult time for Theodore and his parents, and to this day remains a relentless and tireless daily effort of needles, insulin, finger pricks and food monitoring to keep him healthy. In years gone by, without the progress achieved by JDRF, this would have been even more nerve-racking for the Aslanidis family. Research into technology, such as insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring, allows Julie, like other parents, to constantly check Theodore's blood sugar on her phone, even while Theodore is sleeping, out playing or at school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now their focus is on a cure, which would mean kids like Theodore could live a carefree life and parents like Julie could breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that their child wouldn't suffer a dangerous high or low at any moment. The JDRF's Clinical Research Network is aiming for $50 million in funding over five years to focus on research for that cure. I look forward to walking with the JDRF on Sunday in their non-partisan SA pollies team, and encourage all my South Australian colleagues from all sides to join us in walking to make type 1 type none.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="230485" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHRISTENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  People living in the North Queensland city of Townsville are currently facing two major issues. One is the need for water security; the other is the need for more local jobs. More local jobs can be created by government investment in infrastructure projects, especially projects that create or expand an industry. Two water projects in North Queensland, the Hells Gate dam and the Urannah dam, will do just that. The latter is a bit further away from Townsville, but technical studies on Urannah are being completed and a draft preliminary business case is due in February. Work already done shows the dam can facilitate 20 new resource projects and 16 existing mines, generate more than 1,000 megawatts of renewable energy and open up more than 40,000 hectares of prime agriculture land for irrigation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Closer to Townsville, the Big Rocks weir project is just about shovel ready at stage 1 of Hells Gate. It will not only create almost 400 jobs but create them quickly and create them for Townsville jobseekers. That alone would restore 80 per cent of the jobs that were lost at Queensland Nickel. Big Rocks weir, as I said, is stage 1 of the overall Hells Gate dam project. The Hells Gate dam project will create about 12,000 direct jobs. If that project is realised, we'll go from Townsville having an unemployment problem to Townsville having a labour shortage problem, which is a pretty good problem for locals to have. That's why I'm strongly supporting the need for federal funding for Big Rocks weir and Hells Gate dam. That's why I'm also bewildered by the negativity towards the project from Labor. They've, sadly, tried to pit the project against the need for an urban water pipeline from the Clare pump station to the Haughton channel area. I'm advised that pipeline would cost approximately $200 million to build, and the fact is that the LNP candidate for Herbert, Mr Phillip Thompson OAM, and I are strongly supportive of urban water security for Townsville and also of the hundreds and thousands of local jobs that would be created through the Hells Gate project and Big Rocks weir.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the only immediately available funding for new projects in Townsville is the remaining funds from the $150 million rail project, the TEARC project, that was vetoed by the state Labor government. We've already earmarked $75 million of those TEARC funds to widen the Townsville port access channel, creating hundreds of local jobs right now. The remaining TEARC funds are $75 million and, while I know finances aren't Labor's strong suit, I would've thought they would recognise that $75 million cannot build a $200 million pipeline. Then again, maybe I shouldn't make such assumptions, because, after all, they've promisedâfor what that's worthâ$100 million to build this $200 million pipeline, and I'm not so sure that Townsville's water security, which is a very, very big need for that community, is going to be fixed with a pipeline to a paddock that's 70 kilometres short of Townsville city.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  Invictus is Latin for unconquered, and it embodies the fighting spirit and resilience of our service personnel. Like all honourable members, I've been very impressed with the Invictus Games this week that are still continuing. The Invictus Games in a marvellous event for wounded, injured and ill servicemen and servicewomen. It is for those who are still on active duties and also for veterans. The games use the healing power of sport to aid recovery, support rehabilitation and to generation a wider understanding and respect for those who serve their country. The Invictus Games also recognise the critical role played by families and friends. From all accounts, it's been a wonderful atmosphere up there in Sydney, with a lot of healing, a lot of exhaustion and some fantastic results. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's games have a number of Territorians in the Australian team who are doing us proud. I want to recognise them. I had the privilege of meeting Corporal Sonya Newman recently. She is a very impressive person. Sonya joined the Army Reserve in 1999, and then became a member of the permanent Army in 2002. She's currently posted to the 1st Combat Service Support BattalionâICSSB. Sonya has competed already in the sitting volleyball and swimming. She's bagged a heap of medals: silver in the women's 4 x 50 metres freestyle relay and gold in the women's 100 metres freestyle, gold in the 50 metres backstroke, gold in the women's 50 metres breaststroke, and gold in the women's 50 metres freestyle. Samantha Gould joined the Army in 2007 and has been posted to both HMAS Kanimbla and Choules. She deployed to Afghanistan in 2012 and is now discharged from the Army. She's been competing in powerlifting and wheelchair tennis. Sam lifted 66 kilograms in the powerlifting and, with her tennis partner, Jamie Tanner, made it through to the semifinals. Well done also to Tom Foster, who got gold in the backstroke, breaststroke and 50 metres freestyle relay, and to Matthew Paine, who's going to be competing in the wheelchair basketball. We wish him well for the next couple of days. Well done to everyone at Invictus and all the best for Netherlands 2020.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  Getting power prices down, making sure the lights stay on and meeting our Paris Agreement targets are issues that matter to my community. Small businesses, families, retirees and students have struggled under South Australia's power prices, which are the highest in the world and most unreliable in the world. I know that they're struggling because they've told me they are when I've been out doorknocking, when they've contacted my office, when I'm out at community functions, when I've held community meetings and when I've done small-business visits. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, a number of my small businesses had the opportunity not just to tell but to also tell the federal Minister for Energy when he visited Blackwood with me. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the minister for taking the time to listen to my local small businesses and for taking action on power prices for them. The visit coincided with the announcement that our government will provide $100 million to support the rollout of the state government's Home Battery Scheme. This week, the Prime Minister and the minister also announced a package to reform the national energy market. There are four key parts to our plan. There will be a price safety net to stop big power companies ripping off loyal customers who don't have time to shop around for a better deal. This means savings of around $800 per year for families and around $3,400 a year for small businesses. We're going to stop price gouging by the big energy companies, including banning sneaky late payment penalties and making energy retailers pass on savings in wholesale prices to customers. We're backing investment in new power generators to improve competition and we're supporting reliable power by requiring energy companies to sign contracts guaranteeing enough energy to meet demand. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These steps are vital for small businesses in my electorate, as the minister, my state colleague, Sam Duluk MP, and I heard firsthand when we visited some fantastic small businesses in Blackwood last week who generously took time out of their busy days to let us know the impact that higher prices are having on them and their customers. We heard direct from Jason at local cafe Gourmet on Main, Doug at local bottle shop Cellarbrations, Jack at the Blackwood Dry Cleaners, Amanda at Amanda's Flowers &amp; Gifts and Grant and Kylie at Jacobs Tyres and More about how their power prices have in some cases tripled over the past few years. Prices are impacting on their customers as well, whether it's deciding whether to buy that bunch of flowers, a new set of tyres, a bottle of bubbly for a special occasion, a morning coffee or getting your jacket dry-cleaned. These businesses employ staff, serve our community and keep our economy going.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are determined to fix the disastrous power prices inflicted on every single South Australian by the former state Labor government and by a broken national energy market. We're doing this for hardworking small-business people like Jason, Greg, Jack, Amanda, Grant and Kylie, their families and all of their customers. We are doing this for hardworking Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  This month I was privileged to attend the annual No. 22 Squadron dinner that's held in honour of Flight Lieutenant William (Bill) Newton VC at the Richmond RAAF base. This is a night that brings together many of the current serving members and retired members of No. 22 Squadron to remember the bravery of Bill Newton, who went missing in action in March 1943, having completed 52 operational sorties in New Guinea in World War II. Bill's story as an airmanâhis passion for flying and his skillâis worth hearing. The presence of his family members at the dinner, including young grand-nephew Will, who shares his name and birthday, makes it a very special event. It was a wonderful night, and I congratulate all those involved in making it happen and thank New South Wales Governor, David Hurley, for his thoughtful and powerful speech. What I walk away with from these evenings is the reinforcement that the people who choose to serve this country in the military have particular qualities that set them apart. Every conversation I have with members of the Defence Force and veterans reinforces for me that the choices they make to serve are ones that make them different from civilians and that they need a special set of supports from this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we rightly focus on the needs of veteransâtheir medical and mental welfare needs as well as the more practical part of transitioning to the civilian worldâwe also need to focus on their families more. I find myself often in conversation with partners of serving and former defence members, who share with me some of the extra challenges of having a partner who will move every couple of years into a new role in a new town in a new state. This is why I believe it's right that we develop a military covenant to make sure our serving men and women and their families know how much we value their service and remain committed to looking after them. Labor has made a commitment to do this, and I was pleased to hear the Minister for Defence say that he's also exploring the idea. I do hope that we can work collaboratively on this so that it's an issue that binds rather than divides us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are of course in awe of the determination, strength and skill that's currently on display in the Invictus Games. I've read many of the interviews with athletes, and the recognition of the transformational effect from their involvement in these games, after being injured or nearly killed in an incident, is clear. So many of the athletes have talked about having a purpose, having a reason to get moving, having a challengeâall the things we know can help make life worth the effort it must be in coming to terms with a changed physical ability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Blue Mountains, we are particularly proud of Springwood resident Craig McGrath, who won Australia's first gold medal of the games, in the sailing, and also a silver medal in a driving event not officially part of the games, but he was pretty pleased to be presented with his medal by Meghan, who he said was very nice. Like so many competitors, Craig has enjoyed the experience of the Invictus Games and his close encounter with the royals. Craig was serving in Afghanistan in 2012 when he and members of his unit walked into a booby trapped mud wall compound. Five metres from where the bomb exploded, he sustained shrapnel wounds to his ankle, hip, knee and shoulder, a broken leg and burst eardrums. I met Craig in his home a few weeks before the games. We talked about his work in Afghanistan; his recovery; the impact on his family, including on his young sons, of both his service and his accident; and the decisions and choices that he's had to make. I'm absolutely thrilled for his success. We don't have a lot of champion sailors in the Blue Mountains, but the large group of Blue Mountains family and friends cheering him on were very proud of him, and we all know how proud we are of his achievements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our willingness to invest to support people like Craig and others who have come to me to talk about transitioning shows me that we have work to do and we must continue doing it. That's why Labor has announced a veterans employment program. If we're elected, this program will ensure that veterans' skills are not lost in translation. It will encourage businesses to get the benefits of employing these highly valuable people. There are four key elements to our program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first is about businesses, providing training grants of up to $5,000 to address any specific short-term skills gaps that a potential employee may have which might be the barrier to their employment. I have talked to veterans who have missed out on interviews, and often this is about businesses simply saying, 'Look, you've got nearly everything, but there's one bit missing.' These grants will help address some of those issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of it is to better inform employers about the skill set that former ADF members have. I think the five days I spent at Amberley on the base last year showed me the extraordinary breadth of skills, be they organisational, management or specific trade skills, that members of the ADF accrue in their very many roles over the course of their time with the ADF. We will be providing $30 million to an industry advisory committee to fund and develop a national campaign to make sure that this extraordinary skill set is better understood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third thing is to establish an employment and transition service for anyone transitioning out of Defence. This will provide greater individualised and tailored support to veterans over a longer period of time. It will work with individual veterans to identify career goals, audit the skills they have acquired over the course of their career and make sure that they obtain civilian recognition for those skills. The service will also work with veterans to identify other potential barriers to employmentâthings like health, housing and community support that they may need to make sure that they can find fulfilling employment. I think we all know that a first job doesn't always work out, so we think that this service should be available to veterans so they can return to it over a five-year period after they have left the ADF, just in case they need some extra advice or guidance as they go on that journey into the civilian world. We also want to see the qualifying period for extra education and training assistance brought down from the current requirement of 12 years to five years, and the top level of assistance down from 18 years to 15 years. Given our understanding that, on average, members serve for 7Â½ years, the change would mean the majority of those who leave the ADF would be able to access the assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth part of our employment and transition plan is to work with the states and territories and peak industry bodies to identify opportunities for greater automatic recognition of skills that veterans have. We think these things will help the transition which is so important to take people from the career that they have so successfully had in the Defence Force to being successful in a civilian world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When an individual serves, in many ways their families are serving too. As I have said, they have to pack up and move frequently. When Defence Force personnel move into civilian life, their families are also faced with a very big change. Again, this is an area where we need to work more closely with families so that their voices are heard in this process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the other area that has come up for me time and time again is recognition of the things we need to do to support the mental health of serving Defence personnel as they leave the service. The Senate inquiry into veteran suicide showed us many things. The Mental Health Commission report into suicide and self-harm and the ANAO report provided really clear recommendations on how we can do better. I welcome the government's commitment to implementing many of the recommendations, but I note we're also waiting for the Productivity Commission's review. While it is important to wait for those final recommendations, I would urge the government not to stall on these things. There are things the government could do immediately such as lifting the Medicare rebate freeze, because right now that's impacting on the day-to-day medical needs of people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I'd like to speak about Remembrance Day on 11 November. This year we mark the centenary of armistice and, like many others, I'll be marking this one in one of the RSL-organised ceremonies in my electorate of Macquarie. I'd like to encourage the community to take part and share a minute's silence to recognise the guns falling silent on the Western Front after more than four years of continuous warfare. We'll remember those in that war who sacrificed so muchâin my case, both my grandfathers served on the Western Front, and they made it home but not without their scars. We'll remember those who served in World War I and subsequent conflicts and have paid that ultimate price. It's important that we do take the time to remember and reflect, and as we do we should thank our ex-service organisations for giving us the opportunity to do that at these commemorative services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank all current serving men and women of the Defence Force and their families for what they do in serving our nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="61378" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr EVANS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  It's pleasing to be able to speak for a second year running on the annual ministerial statement on veterans and their families. Representing Brisbane in the federal parliament, with the Enoggera Barracks on the edge of that electorate means I have the absolute privilege of spending a lot of time with serving Defence personnel as well as the many veterans across our community in Brisbane. As I noted last year when the inaugural statement was made, these ministerial statements are opportunities for governments to measure their efforts, their progress and their progress in policy and administration. They're intended, I think, quite deliberately to be a frank, warts-and-all type of assessment of how we're doing here in Australiaâthe good and the badâand they should act as a yardstick over time for how government's performance is measured and viewed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see this deliberate approach by governments in more and more areas of critical policy. When these critical and complex issues are finally canvassed in the community, when problems are finally brought out from under the carpet, enter the national conversation and get the recognition that important issues deserve, it naturally follows that governments provide more resources, more focus, more efforts and more funding. But it's about more than that. These ministerial statements and the work behind them are about making a really conscious effort to try new things to succeed and to fail fast if some attempts, experiments or initiatives are indeed going to fail, but, when things work, to quickly ramp up on those successes. Further, these ministerial statements can accept and respond to the fact that all people are unique. Their needs and their experiences will be different. There's often no magic bullet or any one-size-fits-all policy. In other words, these annual ministerial statements are a very deliberate commitment to a process that will guide us to keep doing better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this year's annual ministerial statement, delivered yesterday, the minister mentioned a number of priorities where the government is addressing some serious DVA service problems, overhauling the systems of the DVA and getting them into the digital ageânew online capabilities and servicesâleading to faster claims processing and also moving to that single point of telephone contact, 1800 VETERAN. The minister also mentioned continuing good work in areas like employment initiatives and transition-to-work programs. The minister also mentioned a number of independent experts and reviewers looking in their work at different ways to make the next round of big improvement. This includes work by the Productivity Commission into rehabilitation and compensation systems, studies into advocacy and support systems, and more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were a number of new initiatives and trials that were outlined in this year's statement, and a few of them in particular caught my eye and I thought would be particularly relevant given some of the stories and experiences that I hear around my electorate of Brisbane when I talk to serving personnel and veterans. The ones that caught my eye included a new annual comprehensive health assessment by a GP for all separating ADF members; a new family support initiative, so providing extra child care and counselling services for the children and families of veterans who have undertaken warlike service; a new payment to support financially vulnerable veterans and their families while they await decisions on a claim they've made for mental health conditions, and early access to rehabilitation services; a new 24/7 counselling service for veterans and their families called Open Arms, which was launched by the minister recently; and, interestingly I thought, a trial using assistance dogs, which will be paired with veterans with post-traumatic stress. Those were some really interesting new initiatives and trials that had been announced and brought together in this year's ministerial annual statement. There were many others listed in the statement, but I won't repeat them all now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a related topic, the minister also mentioned in the statement the Invictus Games, currently underway in Sydney. It would be remiss of me not to mention a local Brisbane hero at the Invictus Games, Emma Kadziolka, who on Monday won a gold medal and a silver medal for indoor rowing. One for endurance and one for sprint. Emma was actually the co-captain of the Australian Invictus Games team last year, and so it seems Emma is really continuing to go from strength to strength this year. Congratulations to Emma, she's making her city and her country so very proud. We know that 'invictus' means 'unconquered', and all of our athletes, I believe, at the Invictus Games truly embody that spirit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On another related topic, I want to mention how pleased I was just a few weeks ago to take the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, to a special fundraising lunch in Brisbane being run by a local community group called 42 for 42. The name 42 for 42 comes about because of their mission, which is to commemorate the 41 Australian service personnel who made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan, and the 42nd represents all of those who have come back, and those who have lost their lives to mental health and suicide. They have a very special mission; they are hoping to build a memorial in Brisbane in an incredibly iconic location, in a beautiful memorial garden right next to the Suncorp Stadium. The lunch they held in Brisbane the other week was to raise awareness of their quest, but also to raise much-needed funds. It was so pleasing to see so much of the local community come together to support their fundraising and awareness efforts, including the Former Origin Greats, Kev Walters and all sorts of other people from around the community, including Rupert McCall, a poet who made a fantastic and emotional contribution to the lunch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, to all ADF service personnel, to all our veterans, to their children, to their families in Brisbane and right around the nation: thank you for your service and for your sacrifices. Australians should be proud of the many ways we do serve and care for our veterans and their families, but we strive, as we should, to do more and to do better. This year's annual ministerial statement on veterans and their families has been a useful marker for our progress, and it also serves as a road map and a guide for our next steps. I'm determined, as I'm sure is every member of this parliament, that we do not fail. We owe it to the many men and women who've served our country, and to their families. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249908" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'TOOLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  Townsville is a very proud garrison city, and as the elected representative for our community, it gives me great pride to stand here and speak to the veterans ministerial statement. I believe the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, said it best when he said, 'As a nation, we are better at honouring the memory of our dead than looking after the living.' These words are echoingly true when it comes to our Australian veterans. We can never fully repay our debt to our veterans, but we can give them our long-term gratitude, respect and support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many veterans, the freedoms that we experience in our nation are important enough for them to endure long separations from their families, miss the births of their children, freeze in subzero conditions, bake in the deserts and lose limbs. Far too often, sadly, lives were lost. Military spouses have had to endure career interruptions, frequent changes of address and a disproportionate share of parental responsibilities. The children often have had to deal with changes in schools, separation from friends and, hardest of all, the uncertainty of whether their mum or dad would return from their tour. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Warriors need advocates in parliament, and I am passionately one of the strongest advocates for veterans in this place. We are here to serve veterans, their families and our communities. Veterans need each other, but, more importantly, our country needs our veterans. Those who defend us must be supported. Whether their service was in Afghanistan or Vietnam, we need to serve veterans as well as they serve us. Veterans don't ask for much. They do not want to be a special class, but benefits are a mere drop in the bucket compared to the financial and human cost of war. While not all veterans see war, all who have served in the military have expressed a willingness to fight if called to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Homelessness is another issue that affects veterans disproportionately. Too often today's tattered citizen on the street was yesterday's toast of the town in a crisp uniform, supporting a row of shiny medals. This is hardly the thanks of a grateful nation. We can do better and we must do better. We need to acknowledge their work, their sacrifice and its significance. Can any CEO or chairman of a bank truly claim to have more responsibility than a 21-year-old corporal walking on patrol in Afghanistan?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Veterans have given us freedom and security. It is impossible to put a price on freedom and security, but it is necessary to ensure that our support is readily available when needed. We must remember them and we must appreciate them, and that is partly what the annual statement on veterans provides. Every year the government provides a statement or an update in relation to our veterans. In preparing for my speech today I looked back on the speech I made last year regarding the veterans statement. It saddened me to see that in a year the issues are still pretty much the same: unemployment is still incredibly high in the veteran community; suicide is still occurring; and families are still suffering distress. These are not issues that will be rectified overnight, but the annual veterans statement holds the government accountable and responsible to those who have served this country. It's a chance for us to look back and reflect on the last year and genuinely ask: have we in this place done enough? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have supported all of the government's veterans policies where the policies do make a positive difference, but I do not believe that their commitments go far enough to show our veterans that we are grateful for their sacrifice and service to this nation. However, I do believe that Labor's announcement to establish Australia's first military covenant does go further than just an annual statement. The annual statement is needed, but a legislated military covenant is critical. The military covenant will ensure that our serving men and women know, in no uncertain terms, that we value their service and remain committed to looking after them. A commitment to a military covenant builds on previous announcements that Labor have made, such as our $121 million veterans employment package. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finding and maintaining employment after serving is very important to veterans for many reasons. It's not just about financial security. The dignity of work provides structure, community and a sense of purpose and belonging. It is a reason to get out of bed each day, and that is something that many ex-Defence personnel say they miss when they leave the ADF. Many veterans do not immediately find a meaningful career post their time with the ADF. These are highly skilled and desirable employees who would make a valuable addition to any workplace, but the statistics show us that these skills are not necessarily acknowledged or valued by civil society because many of these skills are lost in translation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want veterans to know that we value the sacrifice that they have made then we must do better. We must ensure that veterans are best positioned to move into employment post service and that businesses understand the many benefits of employing a veteran. The government has developed the Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Program, and I support this program. We can absolutely do better in this space. Labor's veterans employment program does just that. Labor is the party of jobs and employment, because it's in our DNA. We understand the employment issues that veterans face and, more importantly, we are committed to addressing these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are roadblocks because veterans' skills are lost in translation from military life to civilian life, roadblocks because veterans are discounted before reaching the interview stage because they don't meet the tick-and-flick process and roadblocks because employers ultimately fail to recognise the many skills that our ADF members have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is for this reason that Labor has announced a veterans employment program. This program will ensure that veteran skills are not lost in translation and will encourage businesses to benefit from employing these highly valuable young men and women. There are four key elements to our program. The first targets businesses by providing a $5,000 grant to address specific short-term skills gaps which may otherwise act as a barrier to the veteran's suitability. I have heard from veterans who have applied for hundreds of jobs and in some cases have never gotten an interview. The process is demoralising and doesn't value the many skills and experiences of our ADF members. While there could be many reasons for this, one reason could be that the veteran is simply one unit shy of a qualification or fails to meet the two years previous experience criteria but would otherwise be suitable. These grants will go a long way to ensuring that these gaps can be addressed and that there will be an incentive to remove those barriers and roadblocks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition we have announced that we will provide $30 million to an industry advisory committee to fund the development of a national campaign which will highlight the many skills of former ADF members to employers. We will also establish an employment and transition service for transitioning members, which will provide greater individualised and tailored support to veterans over a longer period of time. This service will also work with veterans to identify other potential barriers to employment, such as housing, health and community support, that they may need in order to ensure they can also find fulfilling employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From speaking with veterans, I know that many leave with very clear goals in mind about what work they want to do after they leave the ADF, but sadly it doesn't always work out. Labor is promising that this service would remain available to veterans to return to over a five-year period after they have left the ADF, just in case advice, services or support are needed. We will bring the qualifying period for extra education and training assistance down from the current 12 years to five years, and the top level of assistance down from 18 years to 15 years. On average, members serve for 7.5 years. This change would mean that the majority of those who leave the ADF would be to access the assistance, and that is a very crucial point. In addition, Labor's plan increases the amount of funding available to individuals and allows greater flexibility in the way transitioning members can use this funding, such as in obtaining multiple qualifications that are required for employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In noting the importance of the service of our veterans, we must also acknowledge the family sacrifices and commitment. Serving families are routinely faced with the choice of packing up their lives and moving or spending significant time apart a loved one. Post-service lives are changed again as individuals and their loved ones reorientate their lives. As the mental health commissioner has identified, this strategy will give families a voice and provide a national blueprint to include engagement of the departments of Veterans' Affairs and Defence with military families. As the Centenary of Anzac draws to a close it is important that we consider how we keep alive the memories of men and women who have served and who have died. While we no longer have the benefit of any of our World War I diggers with us, it is crucial that we remember their experiences. I believe that Labor's commitments to our veterans and their families show a clear plan and reflect the gratefulness and thanks we have for our returning soldiers. I conclude by congratulating the nine athletes from Townsville that are competing in the Invictus Games. They have won numerous awards.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IJ4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:59</span>):  I acknowledge the contribution by the member for Herbert, who has a close association with the large serving and veteran community, and say how well she represents their interests here in this place. I also acknowledge the contributions made during speeches yesterday by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon Darren Chester, the member for Gippsland, and the shadow minister, the member for Kingston, for demonstrating very clearly to those who were listening or may have been present in chamber that there is strong bipartisan support for veterans and our serving personnel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I, like them, want to start by thanking those men and women who wear a uniform in service to our country, both those who are veterans and have served previously and those who are currently serving. And like the member for Herbert, who spoke in her final comments about competitors in the Invictus Games, I think all of Australia is inspired by what they're seeing at the Invictus Games, seeing people who have been, in some way, damaged by their service, wounded. They have found an expression, through their performances and through their love for one another at these games, of how we should view ourselves in working with our veterans' communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 11 November next month, we will see the 100th anniversary of the Armistice. That will complete, in many ways, four years of commemoration activity, both here in Australia and overseas. Importantly, I think it has provided the opportunity for all Australians to acknowledge and understand the contribution, the sacrifice and the loss that happened as a result of so many Australians serving, firstly, and then losing their lives in the First World War. It has reminded us to think about all of those who have worn a uniform for us and made the ultimate sacrifice. But, as we've heard, it's not only those who make the ultimate sacrifice that we should be concerned about; it's the many tens of thousands of people who have served our country and come home from conflict with no apparent physical harm but, over time, developed what might be seen as issues to do with mental health as a result of their service. We are now alive to those things in a way which wasn't the case previously. After the First World War and even the Second World War, the standard of services available to our serving personnel once they'd come home were not what they are today. Thankfully, we have shifted in our mindset. We understand the issues people now confront and have confronted when they return from service and we are doing our very best to work with them and ensure their needs are properly met.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the contribution yesterday of the shadow minister, the member for Kingston, and for her outlining of the initiatives she has developed in partnership with the Labor team around addressing issues to do with current veterans. I applaud them. I'm not going to articulate them againâthe member for Herbert went through themâbut I just do want to make a point that I'm really pleased that we're accepting the transition space is where we've got to do a lot of work. We've got to really understand also that there are some people who have transitioned or will transition into the future, who, when they're leaving the uniformed life behind, don't want anything to do with those uniforms or the organisations to which they belong and so they escape visibility and they escape connection, and it's those people that I am particularly concerned about. I know it's difficult because you can't interfere in people's choices but we've got to have some way that we can maintain a connection with all of the people who serve so that if and whenâand we know this is happening regularlyâtheir comes a time when their service impacts on their health, whether through some physical disability or mental health issue, they are able to get access to the services they need to address those issues. It's particularly important for those people with mental health issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've expressed it before in this place that those of us who haven't worn a uniform in conflict cannot know what it's like. We can hear from people, we can talk to people, but we haven't the lived experience. We've had almost constant conflict in the Middle East for a damn long time, and we've had serving personnel, particularly Special Forces soldiers, on the front line on a continuing basis, effectively, doing six, seven, eight, nine and 10 tours of duty. The compounding impacts of those tours of duty over time are going to have an effect. We've got to make sure that the support structures are in place, both whilst they're in service and when they're not. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the work which has been done by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Defence that whilst those people are in service they have the psychological supports and are strong. If you remove those supports when people depart, it's no surprise that some people will find it difficult. The impact of their compounding service affects them. What we've got to do is find mechanismsâand this is what is happening through the proposals which have been put in place by the shadow ministerâthat will help address their needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't have the prospect that, because someone has served their country, whether it is for five, 10, 15, 20, 30 or 40 years, on leaving the uniform they're not able to find a jobâshould not. We've got to find the capacity to make sure that every person who leaves the Defence Force, on transition, knows that they have the support they will need to get extra training and an employment opportunity. That's an obligation that we, as a nation, need to accept. I know that both the minister and the shadow minister understand that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been of the view for a long time that, as soon as someone walks through the gates at Wagga on their recruit training, they have an identifier which says: 'You are now part of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. We, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Commonwealth, have an obligation to look after you and your interests until you're dead.' Indeed, post service, veterans need to have full knowledge that their families are going to be looked after. We've got to inculcate this view in people so that they know it's normal to get access to services. I know the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the people who work within it are endeavouring to do their utmost to make sure that this is the case. I want to thank those people who work over there in the Department of Defence, who strive every day to do the best they possibly can for our serving personnel, and the Department of Veterans' Affairs for our veterans. They need our support. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="56430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DRUM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  I want to acknowledge the contribution from the member for Lingiari on this issue and also acknowledge the statement that the minister gave to the House yesterday on this government's commitment to veterans. It certainly is an incredibly important part of our culture that we continuously acknowledge the various conflicts which this nation has been a part of. We acknowledge that not one of those conflicts which have been a part of have ever been for personal gain for Australia; effectively we have always sent our troops overseas to maintain what we would call the status quo, to quell the invaders, to make sure that we could assist these countries to effectively stop people from invading other lands. One could have a debate about whether we were invading Turkey in relation to Gallipoli, or whether we were trying to stop the German army's invasions throughout Europe. But I think it's very fair and very reasonable and true to say that Australia has never effectively sent our troops away so that we could improve the amount of land that we were to rule over. So our history is rich and our history is honourable when it comes to our conflicts. In the space of that, or using that as a basis, we can be very, very proud of our troops for the work that they have carried out right around the globe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also true that when many of our troops come back from service, they effectively don't want to be involved with the RSL. Many of them think that's for members from other conflicts, from other generations, to be a part of. But at various stages in their lives, in many instances, they do find their way back to the RSL. Sometimes it's in search of comradeship, other times it's in search of support and assistance that they need to get on with their daily lives. There's myriad of ways we are helping our veterans. As the minister stipulated yesterday, there's an $11 billion commitment from this government to our veterans. Over 280,000 veterans throughout Australia, along with their families, are currently being supported by the government. It's a very significant community and it's a very, very significant contribution from this government and the Australian taxpayer to assist with the work that we are doing to support our veterans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said a few times in the chamber in the last week and a half, I was lucky enough to spend a week with our deployed servicemen in Afghanistan recently. It's an amazing experience, and in a short space of time it gives you a firsthand understanding of the calibre of our troops, the most amazing men and women I've ever met, and certainly their discipline, their commitment to the detail, their humility and their understanding of their place in the world. They understand the dangers that are associated with Afghanistan becoming totally lawless. They understand the horrible loss of life that happens in Afghanistan every day. They understand the importance of the elections that took place last week. The coalition forces over there must assist in helping the Afghan government reform after this election in a credible manner so that we can have a government over there that has credibility amongst the people of Afghanistan and is then able to plot a future that involves education and health servicesâa couple of key elements in the Afghani dynamic at the moment that are sadly lacking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We face this incredibly complex situation in Afghanistan, with ISIS and all of its various forms popping up all over the place, and with the Taliban's constant lust for power and ability to drive down anybodyâwhether it be the local police force, the local army, a school, a council, or anybody that dare poke their head up and try and offer the people of Afghanistan some sense of a proper programmed life. They will be effectively under the threat of losing their life through the Taliban. So there's this very complex situation over there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our troops are toing an amazing job trying to normalise the daily lives of the Afghani people. And it's when you have these relationships with these peopleâalbeit from a very safe area of the compounds, where we were looked after incredibly wellâyou can see in the eyes of what they call the guardian angels, these incredibly trained Australian troops, that they are on constant alert. They thrive on this pressure, they thrive on their responsibility to keep all those around them safe, they thrive on the fact that they are trained to within an inch of their lives. They are incredible specimens of troops, of military personnel. Their capabilities are phenomenal. However, you can see the stress that they are under. If you offered them an opportunity to leave, they would not leave. If they weren't in that deployment, they would be desperate to be in that deployment. So, whilst they love the situation they find themselves in, there is no doubt that they are under extreme pressure to be able to, at a later date, transition back into mainstream life here in Australia and pick up all of the long-term responsibilities that come with thatâreuniting with their families, with their children that they haven't spent a lot of time with, with a partner who they've been away from for a long time. When you talk to them, you can understand the pressures that they are under. Many of these amazing troops are young and married with children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the Defence Forces have been very wise in setting the time that they deploy our troops forâaround six to seven months is the deployment time for most of our people. There is a cost in doing that, because the relationships that our troops forge with the Afghani army and the various office holders within the Afghani structure are critically important. Seven months is not a long time for our officers to forge those relationships and take their army forward. Ultimately, the entire operation over there is about our ability to take the Afghani army forward. So, we do pay a price for these shorter deployments than what would otherwise be optimal, but we do this solely with the health interests of our troops at heart. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the structure that we currently have in place with our troops. They are desperate to go over there and test themselves in these conditions, but we all understand that it does place these young men and women under incredible stress. Therefore, when they do return, even people who may not be affected by any form of post-traumatic stress are still going to face this incredibly tough challenge and task of being able to assimilate back into family life and of being able to go and work in a workplace environment where discipline and structure is not necessarily the order of the day, where there can be a few loudmouths and larrikins floating around the workplace who may not respect the other people working in that environment. Moving into that environment is also very, very challenging for our troops. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure that we are there to offer them support. As the previous speaker, the member for Lingiari, said: from the moment they turn up at Kapooka or Wagga or other training centres, we should be thinking about their interestsâyes, let's use these brilliant young men and women in our Defence Force, but how do we help them after they have served their country? How do we help them for the rest of their lives? I think we've got a fair bit of it right, but there is also so much more continued work that we can do to assist our troops in their transition and in and out of mainstream work. The government is keeping this as a main priority, as a serious priority, but there is always more work to be done. The statement from the minister yesterday was very, very welcome. We understand that it's our troops who are doing us incredibly proud, each and every day. Many of us need to make sure that we continually thank our troops.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:18</span>):  In a few weeks' time we celebrate the centenary of Armistice in the First World War. Almost 62,000 Australians died in that war fighting for our freedom and in service of our nation. On the centenary of Armistice, we'll take this opportunity to remember some of those from the Illawarra and the Southern Highlands, in my electorate, who gave their lives for us. One of those was James David Pope, who was a corporal in the 1st Australian Machine Gun Company. James was just 18 years of age when he enlisted in January 1915. He was with his mate, Bert Stokes. They had previously worked as a stonemasons with his father, who operated the trachyte quarries on Mount Gibraltarâand if you know Mt Gibraltar, it overlooks Bowral in the Southern Highlands. On 20 July, just four days after his 20th birthday, James was killed during heavy shelling and gas attacks at the Somme. James' name appears on the Australian National Memorial at Villers-Bretonneux, one of 11,000 Australians commemorated there who died in France and have no known grave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also remember William Alexander Beach, who was born in Dapto to a famous family and attended Dapto Public School. He was one of 12 children and the son of a world champion sculler, who gives his name to an aged-care facility and to a district in Dapto today. William, a labourer, enlisted in 1914 at the age of 33. After arriving in Egypt, William was sent on to Gallipoli, landed on 25 April and was wounded in action on 22 July 1916 sometime later at Pozieres. William returned to Australia in October 1917 and was discharged medically unfit on 11 January 1918 as a result of his wounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also remember Fredrick Crisp from Bowral. Fred was a corporal in the 1st Australian Light House Brigadeâagain, another famous brigadeâand was among the first men in the Southern Highlands to enlist. He was just 19 when he signed up on 25 August 1914 and he landed at Gallipoli some months later. Fred was mentioned in despatches for his bravery, including his daring rescue of a wounded mate, Trooper Donovan. At Quinn's Post, considered the most dangerous place on ANZAC Cove, Fred volunteered to go out under heavy machine gun fire to within 20 yards of enemy trenches to carry his wounded mate to safety. Fred was one of 11 Southern Highland boys killed during the fierce Battle of Lone Pine in August 1915. These were very small communities 100 years ago. To have 11 boys killed in the same place on the same day was a devastating blow to these communities. In June 1916, Fred was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for conspicuous gallantry in the rescue of Trooper Donovan. I'd like to thank Linda Emery at the Story Centre at Berrima District Museum for her assistance in compiling some of these stories. They are some of many hundreds of stories that are available to visitors to the museum, which does a great job of keeping the stories of the district alive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great duty and an honour to attend services and events to remember those like James, Fred and Williamâthose brave boys who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. I am also very pleased to say that in later years locals have taken up the stories of the women who were enlisted in the medical corpsânurses, assistants and other womenâwho travelled to these war zones, many of whom did not come back, who died of injury or disease and who did not receive until late the recognition that they deserve. Their stories and the stories of everyone else who suffered the consequences of this horrific war never fail to move us. We walk in their shoes, on the same streets and on the same soil, but our lives in 2018 are so different to those 100 years ago. We often take for granted the freedoms that were fought so hard to defend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shortly our focus will turn to commemoration of the Centenary of Armistice. Commemoration is just one of the ways way that we ensure our appreciation of the service and sacrifice made by all of those from this date until today, from those days and until today, the men and women of our armed service continues. I am pleased to have provided some support to the commemorative efforts of the Berrimah District Historical and Family History Society, for example, for their recent poppy seed project as a part of the Armistice commemorations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In January 1920, Joseph Maiden, the director of the Sydney Botanic Gardens, received a parcel from France, sent by Ettie Rout, who was the secretary of the New Zealand Volunteer Sisterhood. The box contained poppy seeds gathered in the Somme Valley by school children of Villers-Bretonneux and came with a request that the seed be distributed to the relatives of Australian and New Zealand soldiers who had fallen on the battlefields and given their lives for France, so far from their native land. Joseph Maiden published a letter in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> offering a small packet of the seed to relatives who had lost a loved one. Volunteers from the Berrimah District Historical and Family History Society have indexed the 1,077 names from the registers and have so far identified more than half of the soldiers for whom the seed was obtained and planted. Funding from their Armistice grant will go towards publishing a book which will tell some of the moving stories uncovered by the society's volunteers. The book will be widely available in Australia and at the Sir John Monash Centre at the Australian National Memorial at Villers-Bretonneux, providing another tangible link to the town that is so significant in the commemoration of the Anzacs in France. The society will also encourage local schools to plant poppy seeds, and descendants of soldiers to plant those poppies as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The horrors of World War I ended a hundred years ago. Each year, we have done what we can to hold commemorations to ensure that their sacrifice is not lost. We stop for a minute's silence and remember them. We remember those who have died in service of their country. We remember those whose service changed them forever. We remember the parents who lost children and the children who lost parents. On 11 November, we'll mark the Centenary of Armistice. Many will take part in the one-minute silence to recognise the guns falling silent on the western front after more than four years of continuous warfare. It's important that we do what we can to take time to remember and reflect.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this week, I was very pleased to visit the Australian War Memorial to see the field of knitted poppies that have been gathered in a remarkable display to remember the fallen. I was pleased to learn that some of these, in fact several hundred of them, were knitted in nursing homes throughout the Southern Highlands and gathered by Brendan Nelson, who is a resident of my electorate and leads the War Memorial, so that they could be transported and planted amongst that display. The visual impact of these goes some way to help us comprehend how many gave their lives.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since Federation, almost two million Australian service men and women have served our nation. We thank them and their families for their courage, their service and their sacrifice. As a member of parliament, it's a great honour and privilege to represent the people of the electorate of Whitlam and to seek to be worthy of the ideals of those who sacrificed so much for us. Our democracy, while far from perfect, is the expression of that freedom that they fought for.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:28</span>):  Since Federation, nearly two million Australian service men and women have served our nation. I've always been a proud and strong supporter of our veterans, not only in my electorate but across Victoria and across our nation. I will always be grateful to the courage and the sacrifice of the brave men and women who have put on their uniform to defend our nation. And I understand this personally as well, being the great-grandson of a veteran from World War I, the grandson of a grandfather who served in the Navy at HMAS Ceberus, and the son of a father who served for a period of time in the Army, based at Balcombe in Mount Martha on the Mornington Peninsula.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a few weeks time on 11 November we as a country of many will commemorate the centenary of the First World War Armistice. It is a day to reflect and to respect those who have served on our behalf. The Anzac centenary has given us strengthened national awareness and increased knowledge of Australia's military history and the service and sacrifice of earlier and current generations of Australian servicemen and servicewomen. Just this July I had the opportunity to visit France, go to Villers-Bretonneux and see the new Sir John Monash Centre there as well as the Naours caves on whose walls are the inscriptions of those who served during World War I and in other conflicts. I must thank the representative of the Somme region, Jean-Claude Leclabart, for the opportunity to go with him and see a number of these sites that commemorate of the service not only of our veterans but also of other veterans who served in those conflicts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also seen this awareness reinvigorated locally in Dunkley, with four community organisations and schools recently receiving grants under the armistice centenary grants program to appropriately commemorate the anniversary, drawing on our local heritage and the recognition across the community of the significance of the sacrifices made. Those who have received these grants are: the Seaford RSL sub-branch, who have received funds to expand their cenotaph area; the Mornington &amp; District Historical Society, who have received funds to display their memorabilia from the First World War, which includes photos of soldiers, medals and old coins; Frankston RSL, who have received funds towards the new Frankston War Memorial and the commemorations that will be held there this coming November; and, lastly, Elisabeth Murdoch College in Langwarrin, who have received funds to display memorabilia from the First World War and to install flags at the school associated with the remembrance of those who have served.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also recently announced BEST funding of nearly $23,000 to Mornington Peninsula Legacy House at Mt Eliza within my electorate, who do so much for the families of our veterans past and present. I know personally the work of Legacy. I mentioned my great-grandfather before, who served in World War I. He passed away from the effects of mustard gas poisoning several years after that conflict. As a result my grandmother, Patricia Wright, as an only child, was put through school by Legacy when her father passed away at just the age of 48. At the time she was 11 years old. Without the help of Legacy, I know my grandmother's mother would have struggled to get by and to have supported my grandmother.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is also committed to ensuring that the sacrifice of our servicemen and servicewomen is appropriately commemorated and remembered by both current and future generations of Australians. It is encouraging to see so much engagement around the centenary. Earlier this week, on the day of the National Apology to Victims and Survivors of Institutional Child Sexual Abuse, I was joined in parliament here by a local constituent of mine, who experienced abuse as a 15-year-old cadet within the Defence Force. The Prime Minister later specifically mentioned these victims in parliament during question time and acknowledged those who had been impacted. As we know, those who serve in our conflicts both past and present go through a lot, but there are also those who have been affected by our not operating things as they really should have been operated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing I will note is that this government is committed to caring for the men and women who defend our country: our veterans past, current and future. We must continue to ensure that we look after veterans when they return from conflict and that we prevent situations arising by taking immediate action to help them straightaway and to connect them back into the community. While there is always more to be done, the government will continue to strive towards better meeting the needs of our veterans and their families. Of the almost two million people who have served in defence of Australia, more than 102,000 have made the ultimate sacrifice. To all ADF personnel, the veteran community and those who support them, thank you for all your service, lest we forget.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265990" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  I rise today to add my support to the statements of the shadow minister and the minister in pressing the need to keep veterans and their families at the forefront of our nation's conscience. These are individuals for whom the notion of service has existed as a defining value for themselves, their families, their careers and their citizenship of this country. I say to these individuals: thank you for your service. These thanks must be given at multiple levels. Thank you for embodying your citizenship of this country through a commitment to protecting our interests at an international level. I say thank you for choosing a career of service above a career of comfortâa career where you gave of yourself beyond what most professions ask. I say thank you to your familiesâfamilies who have gone without mothers and fathers for weeks while they've served overseas, families who've endured the uncertainty that comes with a loved one performing national service, families who've supported our veterans in their transition back into the civilian world and families who are often on the frontline of the treatment and care for PTSD, injury and other illnesses our veterans suffer when they come back from service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Words are not enough, because our actions speak louder than our words and it is largely through our actions that veterans will feel the gratitude that we are expressing in this place today. It is our hope that, through Labor's military covenant, we will uphold these sentiments of gratitude within the concrete policy initiatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It takes a significant level of courage to dedicate oneself to national service in Australia's armed forces. As a country, Australia does well at acknowledging our veterans in public life. We speak often about sacrifice, honour and dedication to protecting the Australian values at the heart of our democracy. But, away from this public conversation, the parades, the ceremony and the public acknowledgement, our veterans frequently pay the personal price for their commitment to their country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our commitment to their gratitude must go deeper. We must do better to ensure our veterans are able to find supportive channels of meaning and service in the civilian world. The electorate I represent has an incredible military history. The suburb of Lurnea, in which I've lived all my life, was originally a soldiers' settlement developed in order for veterans to build life, family, work and community after the Second World War. Former soldiers were provided with parcels of land to begin market gardens and ease back into society. These beginnings are still evident in Lurnea today. It's a suburb that thrives on family, community and the values of a good day's work. We are a bright example of the incredible things that come from giving our veterans a solid start back into the civilian world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a very strong commitment to veterans' employment. We want our veterans to find valuable, meaningful career pathways upon discharge from national service. This is why we have announced a $121 commitment to veterans' employment and transition. This commitment is about far more than employment and transitions; it's about our veterans feeling valued in our society. Much of this value can come from a good day's work with a supportive employer. We recognise that this needs to be in partnership that government is in the position to help facilitate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will provide funding to bridge skills gaps and assist industry with meeting the needs of returning veterans. It is also crucial that our veterans are able to access comprehensive treatment and ongoing care for the trauma they suffered in the course of their service. We must continue to support them through open conversation, supportive environments and resources they need to recover. Mental illness amongst our service personnel is not a sign of weakness; it is a sign of strength that they have demonstrated in stepping up and serving their country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this is about ensuring that veterans feel like the valued and supported members of civilian society we know they are. We want them to know they are not alone and continue to have a very special place in our society. This must be at the forefront of our sentiments when we say, 'Thank you for your service.' Lest we forget.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAMING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  This debate, bipartisan as it is, and will always remain, is important to recognise the service of those who leave the comfort and the familiarity of Australia to fight for values we share. The observations of Kenneth Minogue, and more recently Svend Brinkmann, have looked at identifying what, as a nation, we stand for? What are the values that we're not going to keep trading away; we're actually going to stand firm and defend? That's an important question for young Australians educated in an age of moral relativism. Increasingly, we need to be able to identify clearly what is something that is a non-negotiable element in a civil and peaceful democracy that allows us to have elections in a peaceful way, to respect the pen and the word rather than the sword.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make five observations in this opportunity I have been given today. The first one is to note it's not just conventional military service that we recognise in this motion; we recognise all Australians who served either here or overseas, not only in a military capacity but also in a peace-keeping capacity. As I will say later, even in a Kiap capacity through the police constabulary that served in Papua New Guinea. All these need to be recognised as part of this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the privilege of serving in Afghanistan as a landmine-clearing medic and physician with English landmine clearers post the first Gulf War. I lost two of my three closest friends in a landmine-clearing accident in 1992, shortly after I had departed. But they had, as close friends of mine, written back to their families about what drove them to continue to serve even after they had resigned their commissions from the first Gulf War. Tim Goggs, Tim Porter, Julian Gregson: one of them went home to their relatives; the other two were trapped in a landmine-clearing tank after a dreadful accident in Afghanistan. That point is marked by a can of rocks and a small sign that recognises the work they did just to try to rekindle democracy in Afghanistan. That was in 1992. How long have we been struggling, and how many civilisations prior to 1992 were trying to do the exact thing? It's a fight we won't give up on for Julian and for Tim. Both of them were recognised with the highest civilian award for bravery by their own countryâa point I'll be coming to laterâbut they were serving in an unconventional way in the farthest corners of the world for the same thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Closer to home, my dad was a Kiap. He trained as a civilian to serve as a patrol officer in Papua New Guinea. His unusual duty, in 1970, was to disarm the last coast watcher in Bougainville, who had been serving in Bougainville since World War II and was still in possession of his military allocation of both weapons and other equipment from World War II. I remember my dad said to me: 'I had to go and see this gentleman at the plantation and say, "The time has come. The emerging independent country of Papua New Guinea has asked you be disarmed."' While every military item was offered to my dad, he only took what he had to take by law, and that was the weapon. We need to remember those Kiaps now; many of them are passing away. We are yet, in this capital city of Canberra, to recognise Kiaps with a formal location where we can go and recognise the service of Kiaps. Though they served in peacetime, it was not always safe. Papua New Guinea was a very challenging environment for those Kiaps.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bereavement and being recognised in the armed service is incredibly important. We can all remember the embarrassment of the 'mother's medal' up until World War II. Many of us have forgotten that those who lost a loved one in war were sent a letter to go and pick up a medal, a medallion, from their local post office. That is inconceivable today, but let us not judge previous eras by today's standard. We can now do it properly. I think that everyone in Australia who has lost a first-degree relative, a family member, in service to this great nation should be able to wear that proudly on the left breast with the medal array that they have from their relative. But we still can't do that. While we welcome every person who served and their family to march on Anzac Day, I think it's appropriate that we recognise that element of losing a loved one in this service. And that's quite easy to do through a medal that's awarded directly to the next of kin that is noted on those enrolment papers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's yet to occur, but what has occurred with each of the three of our armed forces is a bereavement pin, an element that had been lost to history until 2010, when the former member for Herbert Peter Lindsay retired from the parliament without it having been secured. We made it a coalition policy in 2010. It was forgotten in 2013, but all three wings of the armed forces have gladly gone ahead with a bereavement pin that can be worn proudly by the next of kin who've lost a loved one serving this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own area of Bowman, a particular form of service that is almost forgotten now is the Women's Land Army. Hard as it is to imagine if you took away the equivalent of half a million young people to serve and, self-evidently, only 10 or 15 per cent of them were women, and you had a huge economy that you needed to be run by the women who stayed behindâbut the Women's Land Army did that in World War II. Four hundred women at Victoria Point would go out and regularly tend to the fields in the food bowl of my electorate every minute of every hour of everyday, under the sun, doing a role they hadn't been doing up until then and thinking about whether their loved ones would be coming home. The way they thought about it was actually rolling up their sleeves and farming. It's an incredible story. They received a minor royal visit when a countess popped by in a limousine to see the Women's Land Army in my electorate. She didn't get out of the car, apparently, because it was spotting with rain and she didn't want to upset her bonnet, but all of the young women came up and offered her strawberries. What an era that must have been. And what an incredible and now forgotten service. Many of those women had to take their kids with them while they farmed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, and very importantly, we are now just starting to recognise the breadth and dimension of service by moving of the year when the Vietnam War began. It's now officially 1962. It wasn't always 1962, because we were officially not at war. But I want to say today that Australians were serving then and Australians were dying. The first casualty in the Vietnam War was a gentlemen by the name of Kevin Conway from Wellington Point in my electorate. At the moment, we are reapplying for his bravery to be recognised. I would like to read into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> the importance of his gentleman's service. Sergeant and Temporary Warrant Officer Class 2 Kevin Conway was killed in action in 1964 in the Battle of Nam Dong. As a member of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam, he was placed on his own to work with American consultants in building the capacity of the South Vietnamese to defend themselves. He was the first Australian, as I've said, to die in that war. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He left school at 15 years of age and attempted to enlist in 1943 but was too young for the Second World War. So he joined what was called the postwar army. It is unclear whether he was able to serve in Korea, but he did serve in Malaysia and was awarded the appropriate clasp. He was an efficient and conscientious soldier. He had a practical, common sense approach to problems. He was the kind of Aussie you would want to send to the front line. He was the kind of Australian who could work shoulder to shoulder with the Americans and do our nation proud, which is precisely what he did in an incredibly remote part of Vietnam, close to the Laotian border. What we didn't realise at the time was that up to a quarter of the South Vietnamese that he was helping to train were actually Vietcong. The very men who the Australians and Americans were trying to assist to build their nation and get their nation on its feet and be able to defend from what they saw as a northern threat had already technically deserted but remained to ambush these serving personnel when the time was right. When a bullet was heard and shot in anger, these South Vietnamese were instructed to pull their shirt off, identify as Vietcong and slit the throat or shoot at point blank the Australian or the American they were standing next to. Imagine serving in that context! </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Conway was recommended the Victoria Cross by the AATTV and by Colonel Ted Serong in particular for not only running towards a mortar trench but urging others around him to organise themselves and defend. The US officer next to Conway, Captain Donlon, became the first recipient of the Medal of Honour in the Vietnam War for his actions alongside him. Several other Americans also received an award. But Conway only received the highest bravery award that Vietnam can offer and nothing from Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Colonel Serong visited the scene of the battle, he said Conway and a US Master Sergeant fought their way through the Vietcong just to get to a mortar pit where they began their assignment of firing illumination flares so they could see the enemy. When another Vietcong assault brought the attackers to within grenade-throwing distance of the trench, Conway had two choices: pull out his firearm and defend himself or continue operating the mortar. He chose the latter. We have been through the archives in the last month looking for a previous recommendation for a Victoria Cross for this gentleman. Archives have confirmed that they cannot find it. On those grounds, we are now applying directly to the ministry of defence to ensure that the valour of Kevin Conway is recognised. </span>

                  <a href="53517" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49</span>):  It's a great privilege and honour to speak on this ministerial statement on veterans and their families. I'm all too aware of the dedication, commitment and sacrifices made by our veterans and current serving members. I want to start by acknowledging the longstanding commitment to bipartisanship in this place on Veterans' Affairs and defence. I pledge to continue working in this spirit for the benefit of our Defence Force, veterans and country. I'm proud to have spoken on this topic many times before in the parliament. Today I again place on the record my unwavering support for and gratitude to the brave men and women who have served our nation, for their service and contribution to the Australian way of life, and to the families of our veterans, who have also made tremendous sacrifices for the betterment of our nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had the great privilege while serving in this parliament to meet elected members who have also served our nation in the ADF. I acknowledge in the chamber today the service of the member for Solomon, Luke Gosling OAM; Andrew Hastie, the member for Canning; and Mike Kelly, the member for Eden-Monaro. It has been such a privilege to get to know them, to listen to their stories and to understand the service that they delivered for our nation. They continue to serve our nation in this parliament as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have not served in the ADF, but I do come from a military family. My father served in the Navy during the Second World War. He was a signalman onboard HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Ararat</span>. He enlisted at the age of only 20. He served in the 2nd Australian Imperial Force until Allied victory in the Pacific. I listened to the member for Bowman talk about pins. My grandmother wore a pin every day that my father served in the war. She slept with that pin because she was afraid to take the pin offâif something happened to that pin, something might happen to her eldest son.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Ararat</span> was an Australian warship positioned in the newly captured Allied territory of Cape Gloucester near Britain. Whilst my father was not one to tell many stories from the time he served, I'm pretty sure it's safe to say that life onboard the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ararat</span> was not easy. This is reflective of the experience of many of our service men and women and veterans today. They gave up and have given up so much so that we can enjoy freedom today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are currently almost 2,000 veterans and a further 1,000 current serving members of the Defence Force who now call my electorate of Oxley home. I'm proud to know many of them personally. I enjoy working alongside our local RSL sub-branches to help improve services for members. Every electorate in Australia has RSL sub-branches, but today I want to place on record in the parliament the following that I work closely with and to acknowledge the service, understanding and care they give to veterans: the Centenary Suburbs RSL Sub-branch, the Forest Lake RSL Sub-branch, the Dara and District RSL Sub-branch, the Goodna RSL Sub-branch, the Redbank RSL Sub-branch and the Redbank Plains RSL Sub-branch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Listening and talking to the executive, the liaison officers and the community people who support and attend meetings has given me a better understanding of what veterans require, what support services they need. I do believe that it's important that we as parliamentarians take the time to listen to their stories, their concerns and their challengesâwhether it be better access to medicine or more support for mental health services. It could just be lending an ear for a friendly conversation. It's important that we continue to build relationships with veterans in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also been fortunate to work alongside our future service men and women and see firsthand the next generation of cadets coming through the ranks. This includes in my electorate the Australian Air League Forest Lake air squadron. Most recently I visited their women in aviation event and met with some inspiring and amazing young female cadets, who are in training now for a career in our Defence Force. This was in contrast clearly to those who have gone before them and who joined us at the event. They paved the way for our younger generation to learn the values of the Defence Force and to become role models for others. Next month we will see our young cadets line up alongside our veterans. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've heard in this debate in this parliament and as we've witnessed, we will be seeing the 100th anniversary of the Armistice, when the guns fell silent on the Western Front and, after more than four years of unimaginable bloodshed and destruction, the war was finally over. Earlier this week, I was really privileged to join with a number of my colleagues and with the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister for veterans' affairs and the shadow minister for defence, Richard Marles, when we visited the Australian War Memorial with the director, the Hon. Dr Brendan Nelson AO, and saw the 62,000 poppies made by Australians from all walks of life to commemorate the fallen during World War I.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A little earlier this year I visited the YMCA headquarters in Brisbane, located in Fortitude Valley. The YMCA at Lutwyche also has undertaken a similar poppy project, with 80,000 poppies from around Queensland and Australia, under the leadership of one of their dedicated staff, Meg Woolf. I've spoken about this in the chamber before. I didn't know the reason we wear poppies until I visited the YMCA. Two days before the Armistice was signed, a person who was attending the 25th conference of the overseas YMCA war secretaries decided to pin a poppy to her collar. It's claimed it was Moina Michael, who was working at the 25th conference of the overseas YMCA war secretaries, who decided to do that. To think that one person began what the whole world now knows as a symbol for honouring the fallen is an amazing story. As Labor's shadow minister for veterans' affairs said yesterday:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As the Centenary of Anzac draws to a close, it is important that we consider how we keep alive the memories of men and women who have served and who have died. While we no longer have the benefit of any of our World War I diggers with us, it is critical that we remember their experiences and their sacrifice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I am really pleased that a conversation has begun and that the opposition has proposed establishing the Western Front Fellowship. This fellowship, based on the successful Canadian program, is proposing to support eight post-secondary students a year to work at the Sir John Monash Centre, acting as tour guides, presenting some of Australia's most important history to visitors. This is just one of many new initiatives proposed that include, obviously, the recent announcement by the shadow minister and the Leader of the Opposition about the military covenant, signed by the Chief of the Defence Force and the Prime Minister of the day, that will be accompanied by legislation that will ensure regular reporting to the parliament on how we are meeting our commitment to those who have served. I recognise that the government has also made comments that they're exploring the idea of a military covenant. I'm really pleased that in the true spirit of bipartisanship we will work together, hopefully, to see this progress. Alongside a whole range of announcements that have come forward, particularly around veterans' employment programs, I know that it is critically important that we don't lose the skills of the veterans, that they're not lost, that they're encouraged to enter business and that they're assisted with their work in the community post a career in the ADF.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing I also want to acknowledge the bipartisan ADF Parliamentary Program, which many members, including myself, have attended. It gives us a glimpseâa very small glimpse, as the member for Braddon and I supported and visited Afghanistanâand we're able to better understand some of those huge sacrifices our men and women are delivering for this nation. It's amazing to be able to talk to them in country and to understand the challenges of being separated from family and loved ones, and I encourage all my fellow parliamentarians to participate so that, together, we can develop a better understanding and an even greater appreciation of our men and women serving overseas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="102376" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MADELEINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:59</span>):  I welcome the opportunity today to note the ministerial statement made by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Chester, in regard to veterans and their families and also the accompanying statement made by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Kingston. There are many veterans who live in Rockingham and Kwinana, across my electorate of Brand in Western Australia. There are many women and men serving on HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling</span> on Garden Island, the Royal Australian Navy base located in my electorate. Families of serving women and men offer critical support for those who do enlist to commit an important part of their lives to our nation. Soon HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballarat</span> will depart from its berth at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling</span> to participate in Operation Manitou in the Middle East. It's a very long way from home, a very long way from the beautiful surrounds of Garden Island and Rockingham. In my capacity as the member for Brand, I've had the very great honour of being at one of these farewell ceremonies as one of our Anzac class frigates goes off to participate in Operation Manitou. I don't have family on board these ships but, as a local member of parliament and as a human, it is nonetheless a very heart-wrenching experience to witness a large ship like that, with its large complement of women and men serving our country, drift off from its berth to go and do its great work in the service of this nation. And when HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballarat</span> does depart, I will be there and I will witness that sadness of families waving goodbye to their loved ones. Their loved ones, the ones serving on the ship, are doing their duty. Equally, the families themselves do their duty and get on with their lives, as they must. It is important that we as parliamentarians and also the community as a whole continue to support those families that have to get on with their lives while one of their family is away serving this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As outlined yesterday by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs and my friend, the member for Kingston, Labor has proposed a military covenant to be signed by the Prime Minister and Chief of Defence Force and support it through legislation so regular reports can be issued to parliament to make sure we're meeting our commitment to those who have served. I know the government is looking at this as well and I welcome action so that we can do better to help serving men and women once they have left the service of our nation. As has been noted, it won't be dissimilar to the United Kingdom's Armed Forces covenant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also very important, as we know, to support veterans in their post-service employment opportunities. It can be a very difficult time for veterans and their families as they leave the service of the Australian Defence Force. Labor's been very supportive of developing a national family engagement and support strategy for the benefit and wellbeing of the families of those serving. It is particularly important to make sure all families are helped through any distress and post-service injury that their loved one has suffered. We look forward to being able to work with all members of parliament, whether it is this year or in future years or with future terms of whichever government, to make sure we serve our nation's veterans well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to note my local associations that serve veterans and their families: Rockingham RSL sub-branch, which my father was a member of for many years before he died a number of years ago; Kwinana RSL sub-branch; the Port Kennedy RSL sub-branch, a fantastic organisationâeach of these are fantastic organisations; and also the Totally and Partially Disabled Veterans Association of Western Australia located in Baldivis. I look forward very much to attending the 100th Anniversary of the Armistice ball that is being organised by the Safety Bay Ex-Services and Community Club in Rockingham on 10 November. It will be a remarkable commemoration of 100 years since the end of World War I. Other support organisations in my community that support veterans and their families I would like to acknowledge include the Marilla House Community Centre on Point Peron Rd at the Naval Club and also the Veterans and Veterans' Families Counselling Service. They always do great work for the families of serving women and men when they are away, and I thank them for all the work they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">November 11 2018 will be the 100th Anniversary of the Armistice that brought to an end the four brutal years of conflict that was World War I, a war that devastated Europe and, of course, had ramifications for Australia. Australia was a nation with quite a small population at the time and it's fair to say it lost a generation of men and that affected this country's development for a number of years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In World War I, which was called the Great War, nine million combatants died and seven million civilians perished, so all in all it's estimated that 16 million souls were lost to that very brutal and devastating conflict. On the anniversary of Armistice Day, we'll stop on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month to remember the Great War. In 2018 we'll remember a hundred years since that devastation came to its end. My grandfather, Major George Morris, was a royal marine in World War I, and he's part of that generation that lived to also serve in and survive World War II, having been provost marshal in Alexandria. We can barely understand the catastrophe that was Europe in the first half of the 20th century from the very safe and secure lives that we live here in Australia. People like my grandfather and my grandmother certainly lived that, as did many, many others. They were lucky to survive, living as they did in England but nonetheless serving that cause at that time. My father, John Morris, was also a veteran of World War II, having been a radar operator on ships that participated in the Arctic convoys during the last couple of years of the war. He would tell us many stories, often; I can't remember them all. It was a terrifying time for a young man, quite frankly, in the swells of the northern oceans on the way to protect merchant navy vessels trying to supply Russia so that they might survive the last days of World War II.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This 11 November, coming up soon, will be our opportunity to reflect on this catastrophe and the part Australians played in it as well as to reflect on the devastation and the deaths that were caused by that brutality. There have been ceremonies across Europe since 1918 to reflect on the Armistice. I once went to an Armistice Day ceremony in Benouville in France, a village near the Pegasus Bridge, which was a World War II landmark for some of the British forces; Benouville was one of the first towns in that part of France they retook in World War II. I went with my mum and dad and my husband Jamie. We were travelling and wanted to be in France on 11 November, and that's the town we rocked up to at that hour. We participated in a very simple, very dignified ceremony to remember the Armistice. We were welcomed by the French people in that village and by some British people who were also there at the time. In fact, the young mayor of the village at the time invited us into the local town hall and shared a kir royaleâa type of sparkling champagne. They were very kind, and they recognised at that ceremony, in an impromptu fashion, the contribution of the Australian soldiers to both the conflicts, World War I and World War II, which that part of the world had to participate in just by virtue of their geography. That was a long time ago, maybe about 15 years ago, but I remember it fondly and I remember the French and their kindness to us when we visited.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 11 November we will remember all those lost in conflict, beyond World War I and World War IIâall those who still serve in conflicts and put their lives on the line to protect the ideals of this nation and of Western liberal democracies. I, and all parliamentarians along with me, acknowledge the commitment of the personnel of the Australian defence forces. We must do better to help our serving women and men when they finish that time in service. We must recommit to them, this day and into the future, to make sure we do the right thing and help them as best we can to have a future beyond their service. I want to encourage as many people as I can, if they can, to make the effort to get along to an Armistice Day or Remembrance Day ceremony on 11 November. They're very moving. They're quite simple. They remember a particularly brutal war that we must always remember, never forget, and make sure we don't repeat. Even though we still continue to engage in conflict around the world, maybe one day that will end. But, in the meantime, lest we forget.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:09</span>):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. It's a great privilege to serve our country both in the forces and in this parliament. I think one of our biggest responsibilities in this parliament is to make sure that we not only send those representing us overseas with the best possible support and for the best possible reasons but also give them the best possible support on their return.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to acknowledge the minister's statement of yesterday, and, of course, also the member for Kingston and her statement. What I really love about the member for Kingston and her workâthere are many thingsâis the focus on families. I also acknowledge that the minister spoke also about the families. We can't underestimate the importance of the families and the burdens that they carry. In my electorate in particular, but not only my electorate, serving people and veterans are often a long distance away from their families. They may have a nuclear family with themâtheir partner and perhaps childrenâbut often the military and their colleagues become their family. We want to, in all possible ways, support them with as much family-like support as we can in our communities, because often, as I said, they're quite some distance from their actual extended families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I was listening to my good friend the member for Brand and her familial history, I was reflecting on a very stupid thing that I did back at the time when my mother had two sons in Darwin about to deploy into East Timor in the INTERFET mission back in 1999. We're coming up to the 20th anniversary of that INTERFET mission next year, which will be something really significant for us to remember. It's already 20 years. I was in Perth doing some Indonesian language training with the Army, and I was on the phone to my mother, saying, 'Mum, Dan and Xavier will be going to Timor soon, and I'm really hoping it's not too long until I can join them.' It wasn't until much later that I understood why my mother went silent and went, 'Oh, that's great, Luke.' Three sons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As it turned out, I didn't get over to Timor with the Army for another couple of years after that, but I remember reflecting on it later on. My mother grew up not really seeing her grandfather because he was shell shocked from the First World War and had taken off up into the bush. He lived up in the bush because he'd been gassed as well, and the air up in the mountains was cleaner and crisper and was more gentle on his lungs, but also because he just couldn't handle noise, the city and being around people. Then Mum married my father. They were engaged while Dad was over in the jungles of Vietnam. So her experience as a young mother was with Dad and Dad's mates as they tried to adjust back to life afterwards. And then, of course, her eldest son, me, joined the military. So on the eve of INTERFET, she wasn't over the moon about all her sons going off, but she understood that it was for a good reason. She obviously just wanted her sons to be well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate there are many, many partners and many, many children of the members of our armed forces who wait, hoping that they won't get the knock on the door while their loved ones are overseas. Sometimes it's husbands whose wives are overseas. They hope that they don't get the call. What I'm really focused on is making sure that we've got more support for them in Darwin and Palmerston, in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really pleased that we've committed toâand it was pleasing to hear the minister say that the government is also looking atâthis concept that we've put forward around the military covenant, which is an undertaking that we will ensure that the nation's armed forces are fully supported during and after their service and that we'll legislate regular reporting to parliament on how Australia is supporting our military personnel. I've heard some say that a covenant is just words, but it's the undertaking, the commitment to that and the accountability for that that is so important. I welcome that and thank those working on those policies to make that real.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also proud that we've got a really good employment package. We're going to commit $121 million to a comprehensive veterans' employment policy, which will provide greater support to our defence personnel as they transition to civilian life. The family engagement and support strategy for defence personnel and veterans will provide greater support and resources to military families, focusing on what we know to be the stress points, including that transition for defence members into civilian life. Such a strategy was a key recommendation that came out of the National Mental Health Commission's review last year, and that was a very important initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time remaining, I just want to talk a little bit about the importance of the things that were mentioned by both the minister and the shadow minister, in terms of dedicated services for our current and ex-serving personnel. In Darwin, I am committed to establishing a support centre not only for current and ex-serving defence personnel but also for first responders and their families. At present, there is a lack of services, there is a lack of coordination of support and there is a lack of this greater family outside of the base. Whilst on base, there are some support services, but I think both current and former members of our defence forces and first responders who serve our community need support services that are away from their place of work. That's what we're going to establish. It's going to help ex-servicesâand I use that as the broad service definition, including first responders. It will not only assist them to access the support that they needâwhether it be mental health support or support transitioning or somewhere for their families to go and seek supportâbut also provide a hub of connectivity that not only will connect them to other members of those services and other agencies but also will provide a connection point with the broader community, which I think is really important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a lot of the studies are saying is extremely important in aiding their return into the community is to never lose that connection point with community in the first place. So we'll look at the provision of mental health services and counselling. It'll be a place for professional workshops, physical training, wellbeing courses, men's shed type of facilities, movie nights, barbecues and events that the community can access at times so that that connection with the community occurs. I think it's really important. I think it's overdue. We're committed to it. We're committed to a covenant and better services for our serving people, because they deserve no less.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="30540" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRODTMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:19</span>):  Our ADF personnel put their lives on hold in service of our country. They take risks, they make sacrifices and they commit their lives and wellbeing to the protection of this country. Upon return, the scars these men and women wear and bear are not always visible. But the message we on this side of the chamber want to send today and which also was sent by our shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Kingston, yesterday is that Labor stands by our ADF personnel and stands by their families. That point couldn't be made clearer than by taking a close look at the policies that have been announced by Labor's shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Kingston.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Kingston has announced a range of initiatives to underscore Labor's commitment to veterans. These include a veterans' employment policy, a family engagement and support strategy and, most recently, Australia's first military covenant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Veterans' unemployment has been cited as sitting at 30 per cent, which is significant. For those who did not medically discharge, there is an estimated 11 per cent unemployment rate, which is more than double the national rate. This is simply unacceptable, which is why the member for Kingston has developed a comprehensive veterans' employment policy that will provide greater support for our Defence personnel as they transition to civilian life. The policy focuses on helping businesses to train veterans. It focuses on a new veterans' employment service. It focuses on expanding access to additional education and civilian training and translating the experience of veterans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our veterans', as ADF personnel, are incredibly well trained. We've got a lean and mean Australian Defence Force. As a result of that, those ADF personnel are incredibly well trained across a broad range of areas. Unfortunately, all that training, all that investment that is made in the highly skilled and professional Australian Defence Force is not translating into civilian life. I can't understand why when they are so highly trained. This is why focusing on that transition as this policy does is so vitally important. It ensures that we get the best translation of those skills and that training that they have in the Australian Defence Force into the civilian area. In areas like recognition of prior learning, it is vitally important for the skills and training that the ADF personnel have. There is recognition of prior learning in the academic setting, ensuring that that translates into units and credits. There is a range of other areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken many times on this employment policy that was announced a few months ago by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Kingston, and once again I commend all those listening to read the policy to gain an understanding of it. Again, I commend the member for developing the policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to commend our shadow minister for veterans' affairs for the announcement that a Labor government will put in place a formal agreementâa military covenantâto ensure the nation's armed forces are fully supported during and after their service. We will legislate regular reporting to parliament of developments in that area, particularly on how we are supporting our ADF personnel. This policy will change the lives of veterans. It's a policy that has been modelled on what's actually happened in the United Kingdom, I understand. It's something that the community has been calling for for some time, and the shadow minister for veterans' affairs has listened to the community, has responded to the community and has come up with this suggestion and commitment that, should Labor win government, we will put in place a formal agreement under the auspices of a military covenant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of families, we all know the ADF put their lives on hold in service of our country, and in many ways so too do those families that are supporting our ADF personnel: constantly moving around the country, constantly changing schools, constantly changing jobs, constantly there to support ADF personnel in difficult circumstances, particularly when they're deployed. It's vitally important that our support is provided not only to our ADF personnel and our veterans but also to our ADF families, who play a pivotal role in supporting our current serving ADF men and women and our veterans. These men, women and children are the unsung heroes of our defence forces, and greater support for our military families is greater support for our serving and ex-serving personnel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our family engagement and support strategy is one of the key recommendations from the National Mental Health Commission's Review into the suicide and self-harm prevention services available to current and former serving ADF members and their families. The review highlighted that there is currently a lack of emphasis on the critical role that families play in the lives of current and former serving members. We know that families play an especially unique role within military life and service, themselves making many sacrifices. Our ADF personnel and veterans look to their families for support while in service, in transition and in civilian life. There's no doubt that families also play a critical role in providing support to our serving and ex-serving personnel suffering from mental health issues. Labor is committed to developing this family engagement and support strategy, which will be co-designed with Defence and veteran's families and communities to focus on known stress points for families, including transition for Defence members into civilian life. You can imagine how stressful it is going from that very particular environment into civilian life. That's why we need to provide those supports through the exit process and then through the transition process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also mention that, as we know, there are so many support groups out there for veterans. One of them is here in Canberra, and I just want to do a shout-out to them. It's the ACT Veterans Rugby Club. It's a bit like a men's shed. It's an inclusive environment for men from all walks of life who just want to run around and have some fun, but it's more than that. I acknowledge the importance that this organisation has to our service and ex-service personnel and their families. ACT Veterans Rugby consists of men aged over 35 who have a love for rugby. They compete against a variety of Defence Force teams like the Navy Old Salts, the RAAF Mirages, the RASigs, RMC staff and cadets and the crew of the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span> in charity matches. ACT Vets Rugby has raised almost $240,000 for charities based in the ACT since they've been holding these fundraising events and matches. Thank you so much for the work you do. Apart from keeping veterans on the rugby fieldâhusband, take note: this is not a suggestion that you should put the boots back on; you are banned from getting involved in rugby again.</span>
              </p>

Thank you to ACT Vets Rugby for everything you've done in keeping our veterans healthy and engaged in sport and also for raising funds for the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in closing I acknowledge one Canberra veteran who has been involved in the Vietnam Veterans Association for many years and in many ways is the brains behind the logistics of the Long Tan ceremony that we hold here each year down at the Vietnam veterans memorial. His name is Peter Ryan. He was involved in the Vietnam War. Peter earned an Order of Australia Medal for his 20-year dedication to helping veterans. He was the ACT president of the Vietnam Veterans Association from 2003 to 2013 and was also national vice-president for two of those years. He has been very actively involved in the Vietnam veterans community for many years. Unfortunately last year Peter passed away after a long battle with cancer, but he did get to see that final Long Tan anniversary service. Vale Peter Ryan. Thank you for your service to our Vietnam vets.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="DZP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BIRD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  On Friday night I joined 650 locals, including all of my federal and state colleagues and many of my local government colleagues, at a fantastic local event. It was the Illawarra Business Chamber awards night. 'A little taste of Paris' was the theme for this year. It was a great event. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate some people who organised and put on this event. They do it every year. It's always a huge event on our calendar in the Wollongong area. I also want to acknowledge some fabulous businesses who did well. Many will go on to the state competition and awards as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations should certainly be given to the executive director of the Illawarra Business Chamber and Illawarra First, Adam Zarth, for the organisation of the awards. They are comprehensively organised and judged. The great faith in the integrity of the system is reflected in how many businesses participate. I also extend my congratulations to the judging team. A very large number of locals volunteered to be judges. It takes a lot of time. They were led by Professor Paul Wellings CBE, who is the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong, and Warwick Shanks, who is the managing partner at KPMG Wollongong. I thank and congratulate also Janine Cullen and Terry Wetherall from the boards of the business chambers that hosted the event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I love about this is that the business chamber also uses this as an opportunity to showcase other local businesses. Adam and his team sourced and showcased some amazing local restaurants. There was a specially designed menu to fit in with the Parisian soiree theme. The entree was from Caveau in Wollongong. It is the only restaurant in the region to win a <span style="font-style:italic;">Good Food Guide </span>hat for 14 consecutive years. The main was from Cupitt in the hills of Milton on the South Coast. Head chef Russell Chinn and his team are dedicated to providing the best wine and food experience on the New South Wales South Coast. The dessert was from Stones Patisserie in Berrima. They brought a delicious slice of Paris to the awards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were 20 awards. I hope my colleagues here will bear with me, because I want to recognise each of the businesses. The Illawarra Business of the Year was Itree. This is a very innovative internet security business, which I was very pleased to be able to support with some funding when we had the BlueScope downtown in 2011. They've gone from strength to strength. They're a great local company based at the Innovation Campus in Wollongong. I congratulate them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The outstanding business leader was Kylie Moffitt from PhysioHealth &amp; Sports Injury Clinic. That is something I might need if I try to do too much exercise. Good work, Kylie. The outstanding employer of choice was also Itree. They have a fantastic ethos and culture in their organisation. The outstanding young employee was Andrew Jackson from Itree. His is a great story as well. The outstanding young entrepreneur was Sarah Nolen from Birdblack Design. She was inspiring with her energy and enthusiasm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The business award went to IOH Injury and Occupational Health. It is a great local business. The customer service winner was PhysioHealth &amp; Sports Injury Clinic. The export business winner was Internetrix. That's another business that I've had a lot to do with. They were also supported with a grant under the innovation program at the time of the BlueScope downturn. They've also gone from strength to strength. I'm really proud of them. The innovation award went to Warrigal, an aged-care service provider who does great work. It's an Illawarra business that is now national. They do good work there. The retail and hospitality winner was Uncle Joe's Brew. I highly recommend them. The small business winner was Boab Services. The social enterprise winner was Green Connect Illawarra, a great local organisation that grows a big market garden, in effect, that employs a lot of local refugees. It's a really good initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The local chamber of commerce, the amazing Corrimal Chamber of Commerce, won the local chamber award. They have been doing amazing things in Corrimal. The sustainability award went to Symbio Wild Life Park. Get onto them on Twitter; they've got the most amazing Twitter feed. I have been really pleased to support them for a long time. The tourism winner was Cupitt's winery. The workplace inclusion winner was the amazing Green Acres Disability Services. The start-up superstar was molenaar+mcneice. The Wollongong city centre business was Breakout Bar &amp; Escape Rooms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My congratulations to all 68 finalists, as well as those award category winners. You do us proud in the region. Thank you particularly to the Illawarra Business Chamber and the whole team for putting on such a great evening.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="61378" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr EVANS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  I rise to add my voice to recent calls to better protect wildlife and endangered species both here in Australia and overseas. On the very first opportunity I had to speak here in this parliament, I expressed my enduring passion for Australia's wildlife and environment. Having custodianship of a continent as well as a country means Australians have both significant opportunities and significant responsibilities. In so many ways, Australia is a sanctuary from the challenges and ills from the rest of the world, including for our wildlife. We need to take greater care and make greater efforts to preserve and foster everything we love about this continent, our sanctuary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Taking responsibility means awareness, respect and effort, but it also means serious ramifications for individuals who do the wrong thingâthat tiny minority of people who let the rest of us down. Like most Australians, I have been greatly distressed and disgusted at some of the recent horrific incidents we have seen involving deliberate harm to our native and iconic species. We have seen recent examples of kangaroo killings, emus being run down by a four-wheel drive vehicle, and the killing of wedge tailed eagles. We saw the killing of more than 400 of those beautiful birds. These are iconic Australian species. Two of them are on our coat of arms. Yet we should bear in mind that animal protection is not about the megafauna, the cute and cuddly animals and the relatable species; we have to think equally of the smaller and less glamorous species that can play an even more important role in our ecosystems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I'm calling for greater penalties and nationally consistent penalties for those who kill or harm Australia's wildlife, whether through deliberate acts or what mistaken people might think is silly, harmless fun. The current situation with our laws is that the penalties vary greatly between different states, and some of the laws are quite weak. I'll give some examples. In Queensland, we have escalating fines starting in the range of $13,000 or $29,000 limits. In Victoria, it's a fine only of $7,900 or up to 6 months imprisonment. In WA it's a fine of up to $50,000. Remember, these are the maximum sentences. The actual sentences handed out are much less, and, sadly, sentencing is just not very common.  There are some more serious penalties and sentences at a federal level: a maximum penalty of imprisonment for two years or $210,000. However, bear in mind that the federal laws only apply to species listed on the threatened species list, so it doesn't cover common species like kangaroos or, indeed, those wedge-tailed eagles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In effect, the current laws and penalties are not serious enough to ensure that society or law enforcement agencies consider animal cruelty to be a top-order priority. Community expectations are not being met. The community in Brisbane, for one, wants a stronger response to the recent horrific acts we have seen in the news against those kangaroos, the emus, those wedge-tailed eagles and more. There are also enforcement options to consider here. More serious penalties could ensure that the crimes become eligible for additional or different police investigative powers. We're talking of options like phone interceptions to help gather evidence when there are suspected acts of cruelty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a related topic, I also want to express my support here today for the recommendations recently made to this parliament on a proposal to ban the importation of elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn here in Australia. The recommendations were handed down recently by the Joint Committee on Law Enforcement. I want to note the very good work in recent years of my colleague the member for La Trobe on this issue and related issues. He was also the driving force in the recently successful push to achieve a similar ban on the importation of taxidermied lions, hunting trophies and lion parts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that these issues should be put on the next COAG agenda in December later this year, to bring the states and the Commonwealth together to get serious. People hate seeing our native wildlife brutally killed for fun or for other reasons, and the people of Brisbane have reinforced that hatred to me in their representations on this very critical issue. I'm calling for stronger laws and harsher penalties. That's what the people of Brisbane expect. This should be core business for a country which has the custodianship of not just a country but a continent, and we have here some of the most unique and iconic wildlife in the world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  Ipswich boasts a long history of involvement in soccer or football dating back to the late 1800s. Indeed, the first teams in Ipswich come from places like Bundamba and Blackstone, which were full of Welsh and Scottish miners. The first game of football in Ipswich is recorded on 26 June 1886 at the North Ipswich Reserve, where rugby league and football are still played. The first game is recorded as between the Rovers of Bundamba and the Queenslanders of this cityâIpswich. The Dinmore Bush Rats were formed in 1888 and it's interesting the new and resurrected club is in my first <span style="font-style:italic;">Blair Sports Links</span> booklet. This follows on from the very successful <span style="font-style:italic;">Blair Disability Links</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Blair Seniors Links</span>. I have given out more than 100,000 of these booklets to local community groups, organisations and individuals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to be with the shadow minister for sport, Senator Don Farrell, the launch the <span style="font-style:italic;">Blair Sports Links</span> at the Brothers Leagues Club, the biggest leagues club in Ipswich. Last Saturday night I attended the Western Pride football gala annual awards. I congratulate the under-13 girls team and the under-18 men's team for winning the grand final, building on the victory of the senior men's team last year in the national premier league.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ipswich has a long history, as I say, of football, and recently the Western Pride put in a bid for the A-League licence. Sadly, we were rejected by Football Federation Australia and we were cut, along with Wollongong. It's very disappointing for the local community, but I join with the general manager, my friend Pat Boyle, in being confident our bid is alive in the next round. Respected sports journalist David Lems of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Queensland Times</span> said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">It's hard to comprehend why Ipswich has been rejected as a franchise in expanded A-League competition.</span>
                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Football federation chief executive is David Gallop and, when he was the chief executive of the NRL, he favoured expansion and expressed strong support for the western corridor bid for the Ipswich Jets, joining with Toowoomba and Logan in a bid to enter the NRL. I urge him and his whole executive to favour and look with kindness upon the application in future for the Western Pride.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ipswich is a place where sporting legends are made and we have people like Ash Barty, the current tennis legend; Alfie Langer, a former Queensland and Australian halfback; and Leah Neale, Olympic silver medallist in swimming. Ipswich is a great place for football, and I was pleased last Saturday night to join in congratulating so many players. It's interesting, you know, Ipswich has the first captain of the first-ever Australian men's team, which played New Zealand in 1922. and retrospectively, Alex Gibb has been awarded cap No. 1 by Football Federation Australia. Wouldn't it be propitious then if Ipswich got the next A-League licence, not this time, but the time after?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate many people who received awards and accolades. I want to congratulate Belinda Kitching, a former Matilda player and coach of the Western Pride women's team. She made a terrific speech last Saturday night, congratulating her team and the work they had done. And I particularly want to congratulate: the player of the year in the men's team, Joe Duckworth; the best and fairest, Hayden Mchenery; the players' player, Joe Duckworth; the golden boot, Dylan Wenzel-Halls, with 23 goals from 11 matchesâthat's a great record. The senior women's player of the year was Zoe Lambi; best and fairest, Georgina Adnum; players' player, Holly Van Der Zee; and golden boot, Sophie Weatherby for 15 goals in 26 matches.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to congratulate a young guy who coaches the under-18s men's team and the under-20s men's team, Jordan Manning. He likes to use the word 'massive' but I thought it was his effort that was massive in coaching these two teams. It is really a challenge for him to do that, but he deserves special mention for overseeing both teams while playing for the under-20s. Congratulations, Western Pride. I look forward to seeing you and watching you play in the A-League in years to come. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="261393" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  On the weekend, I had the privilege of attending an extraordinary eventâthe Big Little Histories Of Canowindra. It was absolutely spectacular. Organised by the Corridor Project through Phoebe Cowdery, Dylan Gower and their team of supporters, the Big Little Histories Of Canowindra tells local stories and combines four significant local histories, Devonian, First Nation, agricultural and bushranger. During 2015 to 2018, the communities of the Central West, including farmers, graziers and Indigenous Australians from around Canowindra, shared their stories with the Corridor Project, allowing a team to produce a significant compilation of documented local oral histories. These stories were then told through performing art, photography, paintings and multimedia projections at various sites such as the Canowindra Historical Museum, the Age of Fishes Museum, the Swinging Bridge winery, the Royal Hotel and, of course, the railway precinct at Canowindra, which is full of history. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the many highlights of the event for me was the silos being lit up with animations to give them the appearance of giant aquariums, housing some of Canowindra's earliest residents such as the Grossi and the Mandageria fairfaxi, which were fish who lived in the area 360 million to 370 million years ago. Canowindra is famous for its fossils. With the fish swimming in the silos above, there were projections down below of local farmers telling their stories of harvests and what life was like for them in Canowindra many decades ago. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The event was a triumph. It breathed new life into Canowindra's railway precinct and is hopefully just the beginning of a new era for that precinct and area. The event was created by the Corridor Project and leaves a legacy of innovative material for Canowindra, Cowra and Grenfell historical societies, the Ages of Fishes Museum, Blind Freddy's Bushranger Tours and the National Film and Sound Archive here in Canberra. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're lucky to have some extraordinarily talented people living in our region, and the Big Little Histories of Canowindra showcased their talents beautifully. I would like to make mention of them here in the chamber today. They are, of course, Dylan Gower and Phoebe Cowdery, whose vision it was to bring this project to life many years ago. The curators were Wiradjuri artist Aleshia Londsdale from the Mudgee area; Craig Lawler, Canowindra's very own bushranger expert; and Alison Plevey and Craig Walsh. Production design was by Genevieve Blanchett. Choreography was by Beatrice Murray. And music was by Millthorpe's Chloe and Jason Roweth, Nerida Cuddy, Oli Statham, Maryann Wright, Pascale Stendell, John Bourke and Will Bennett. I also need to mention the contributing artists: Heather Vallance, Kate Barclay, David Isbester, Beatrice Murray, Matt Davies, Genevieve Carroll, Bill Moseley, Mila Gower, Rebecca Dowling, John Daly, Norm Palazzi, Larry Walsh, Clair Liversidge and Lilly Wright. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people who contributed to the oral histories were Julia Andrews, John Daly and Patrick Nolan. The volunteers were Anna Stranger, Charlotte Carroll, Jackie Yeo and Jo Gollings. There were many people who contributed to the videos, who told their local stories and local histories, which were projected on the screens for everyone to see. Harold Balcomb, who is a very good friend of mine, was one of them, along with his wife, Dorothy. They were just two of the featured identities. It was beautifully presented. I would also like to mention the councillors who were there on the evening: Deputy Mayor of Cabonne, Councillor Anthony Durkin; Councillor Cheryl Newsom; and Councillor Jenny Weaver. I should also mention the Parliamentary Secretary for Western New South Wales, Rick Colless. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons that people move to country areas is our vibrant art scene, and this corridor project and the revitalisation of the railway precinct is, hopefully, going to be the start of a new era for the Canowindra region, in terms of arts projects. It was an extraordinary effort and I don't think the area has seen anything like this before. It is very audacious in what it hopes to achieve, but you have very committed, talented artists who are just going to be building on this. So, to everyone who made the event such a success, I offer my congratulations. It was a triumph.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  Tomorrow is a very important day in Fairfield and in my community and in the electorate of McMahon. Tomorrow, Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Primary School will celebrate its 90th anniversary. I'm sure all honourable members join me in congratulating the school, and I thank all honourable members for their support. Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Primary School was formed in 1928 by Sister Flora and Sister Fabian. They were members of the order of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, which, as honourable members know, was founded by St Mary of the Cross, formally known as Mary MacKillop, and Father Julian Tenison Woods to provide for the education of children in rural areas and poor areas. Well, Fairfield no longer quite qualifies as rural. We do have rural areas in my electorate, but Fairfield isn't one of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The service of the sisters and the school has continued over many years. I was there a few years ago for another anniversary and it was great to see so many sisters of the order of St Joseph who'd taught over the years return to Our Lady of the Rosary. Sisters of St Joseph taught my honourable friend, perhaps not at Our Lady of the Rosary at Fairfield but at another institution, and tomorrow we will celebrate the achievement. Sister Flora and Sister Fabian travelled every day from Guilford, which in those days was a significant journey. It's pretty easy these daysâperhaps a 10-minute driveâbut in those days it was a much more formidable journey. They later were given a house on Hamilton Road, which is the road that currently has my electorate office in it, in Fairfield West. They stayed there for seven years, thanks to the generosity of a local church patron, Mr Patrick Hayes. By 1941, the parish had grown and a four-room brick building was built by local handymen at the rear of the church. By 1947, in just a few years, the school had outgrown that expansion and more buildings were erected. In 1949, the school had 400 students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From these small beginnings, Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Primary School became the thriving school that it is today. It's a very important part of our community and I've been visiting it for many years. I've seen the church grow and develop. I remember when it was a small white church. It's now been very significantly expanded and remodelled and is an important hub for our local community. Being where it is on that side of Fairfield station, it is well located for parents. I am often travelling through there in the morning and see parents dropping their kids off at Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Primary School. It is a very important institution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the beginning of 1992, the OLR primary moved to its present site, which was, of course, previously the Rosary High School, which no longer exists. The facilities were made available to the primary school, which has, it's fair to say, improved the amenity of the school enormously. The sisters of St Joseph continue to show leadership in education of students, with sisters from the Josephite order holding the principalship of the school until the year 2000. In 2008, Brother Nicholas Harsas, a Patrician brotherâPatrician Brothers' College is the boys secondary college just around the cornerâwas appointed principal of the primary school. He currently takes leadership of a school of 670 students and 65 staff members. I've had the pleasure of knowing Brother Nicholas now for many, many years. He's an upstanding and respected member of our community. I'm sorry to tell the House, though, that he's leaving our community. He is going on to be principal of Holy Spirit Catholic Primary School in Carnes Hill, which I think I'm right in saying is in the electorate of Fowler. We'll miss him very, very much in the Fairfield community, but he can be proud of his achievements as principal of OLR primary over many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The school proudly continues to celebrate the traditions of the founding sisters of St Joseph. It's now a large, three-stream, co-educational school which continues to grow. I know that demand to go there is very, very strong. Many members of our community apply to go there. There's quite an effort by parents to get their children into OLR primary school, and that's a testament to their track record, their reputation and their achievements. Students from OLR go off now to Mary MacKillop high school, some to Cerdon College and many to Patrician Brothers' College, and they go with a very good grounding. The school has always been a very multicultural community, and it caters to the Catholic faith. For many migrants who've come over the years in waves, for many new arrivals in our community, one of their first decisions is to send their children to OLR, as is of course also the case for many longstanding Fairfield families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I do look forward joining the OLR community tomorrow for the celebration. In the morning we have our annual McMahon Pink Ribbon Morning Tea, which is the highlight of our calendar. We raise thousands of dollars for breast cancer and have a lot of fun. Then I'll be straight in the car and over to Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Primary School to join them, but I wanted to mark the anniversary in the House of Representatives today.</span>

                  </a>  Oh, you're not Catholic? Righto. Before this parliament resumes, Australia and many other nations on 11 November will mark the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Armistice that officially ended the First World Warâthe Great War, the war to end all wars, an indescribably terrible war, a war in which Australia lost over 60,000 from a population of less than five million. In the darkest hours of the Great War, facing defeat, facing terrible odds against the Germans and facing a terrible situation, a leader arose who in 18 months changed the course of the war, turning defeat into victory and bringing the war to an end. He was an Australian. His name was John Monash. Under his leadership, the Australian infantry forces managed to turn the tide of the war to the allies' favour, cumulating in the surrender of Germany.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Monash was a gifted organiser and a strategic thinker, but, let's face it: he was a Jew; he came from the CDF, not from the regular army; he was mistrusted and disliked as a pushy Jew by his peers; he was an outsider working with insiders; and he was disliked by the press. Yet, with all that before him, nothing daunted his efforts on behalf of those he led in the Australian forces. His postwar legacy was the establishment of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. The Electoral Commission, in its most recent redistribution, has paid tribute to his great leadership by naming the new seat, which takes in much of my electorate of McMillan, the electorate of Monash.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir John Monash is an iconic figure in Victorian and Australian history. His connection with the electorate that will bear his name precedes the war by some years. I have recently read two books on Monash: <span style="font-style:italic;">Monash: The Outside Who Won a War </span>by Roland Perry and <span style="font-style:italic;">Monash's Masterpiece </span>by Peter FitzSimons. I also read one on general Australian history and the community around Ballarat at the time of Peter Lalor; it tells the whole story. I put a bit of effort into it to get an idea of the nation as it was at that time. The electorate that's going to be named after him is known for its richness of dairy and beef industries, its deep, majestic forests, its iconic national parksâWilson's Promontory and Mount Baw Bawâand the tourist mecca of Phillip Island, home of Australia's Motorcycle Grand Prix, which will take place this weekend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it was mining that brought Monash to this unique and extraordinary region, connected through his private practice with friend JT Noble Anderson, as civil mining and mechanical engineers and patent agents. The company they established, Monash and Anderson, concentrated on South Gippsland, where coal and gold mining companies were carrying out construction works. They briefly considered setting up the headquarters of the organisation in Gippsland. Monash designed and installed an aerial tramway for transporting quartz at Walhalla. Another Walhalla contract involved about 28 tonnes of machinery from Daylesford to, in those days, beyond Walhalla. Two of Monash and Anderson's girder bridges were built in South Gippsland, one in Kardella and one in Outtrim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Monash's history is well known, but his influence to this nation in turning the tide of the war has meant that we can stand in this place in freedom. Reading the books on Monash can't help but make you cry, but, at the same, it makes you a very proud Australian. I will be honoured if I am successful in the next election to be the member for Monash.</span>
