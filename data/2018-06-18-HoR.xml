Not only has this created a transport bottleneck which strangles our regional economies, but in the past year there have been six fatalities, and countless other road trauma that has devastated families and communities in the Gympie region and Fraser Coast. Building Section D of the Cooroy to Curra bypass is not about convenience, it is about saving lives. Every year it is delayed comes at an unacceptable cost. Proof that Section D will save lives exists in the dramatic reduction – near elimination - of the road toll south of Gympie, where Section A, B and C of the bypass have been completed. While it is appreciated that other regional areas in Australia have roads in need of upgrade, there can be no denying the safety issues that elevate Section D to the top of the list; there should be no human argument which will ever favour easing congestion over saving lives. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This Petition of: Peter Brohier Draws to the attention of the House: In 1996, the Coalition introduced a scheme capable of making Bass Strait ferries part of the National Highway. The scheme aimed at directly driving the economy of South Eastern Australia by moving increased numbers of people and vehicles interstate. It would integrate the economy of Tasmania into the national economy. This initiative closed the final gap in the National Highway making the cost of ferry travel compatible with interstate road travel. Following a promise to expand the scheme in 2001, it was quietly reversed. Without rigorous controls, this turned a highway equalisation scheme and associated promises, into a narrow subsidy, limiting passenger volumes and growth of the Tasmanian economy. So, the water barrier of Bass Strait continues, losing billions in revenue from activities that need people on both sides of the Strait. Federation was about integrating economies, not continuing a separation that justifies additional federal subsidies for Tasmania. Without new highway construction, a simple, all-year, adjustment of passenger fares would immediately extend the Hume Highway to Hobart. The democratic process, utilised by the nation with bi-partisan support, has now failed. Despite massive federal funding, Bass Strait ferries are now not required to compatibly connect the National Highway. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">A critical component to a veteran's (or partner) financial future is a home, particularly if a veteran is injured or killed. Financial uncertainty is a major reason for suicide in veterans. Defence Home Ownership and Assistance Scheme (DHOAS) allows a degree of certainty to a home, via a subsidy to a home loan. Importantly, if this is not accessed while still employed by Defence, the veteran/widow has 2 years to access the subsidy (which can add up to over $100K over its lifetime) before the legislation dictates an expiry. For example, a veteran can serve for over 20 years, have multiple combat tours and if discharged due to injury (or killed) has 2 years to apply for the subsidy. That limitation is morally wrong and needs to be removed. Many veterans/partners are often not in a position (medically or financially) to purchase a home within that 2 year period, particularly if separation and children are involved. Removing this 2 year period will assist in easing pressure and give a degree of certainty to access the loan subsidy at a later date. If a veteran meets the qualifying criteria they should never lose the ability to access this subsidy.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are not seeking any change to the qualification component. We are requesting removal (or substantial increase in time) of the 2 year limitation to the DHOAS Act 2008 (Cth) and DHOAS Regulations 2008 (Cth). This should be a quick fix to an issue that impacts a number of veteran's futures.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Recently the House passed a Bill that changed the definition of Marriage to allow Same-sex couples to marry. Since this we have seen the consequences that have followed - with outrageous public behaviour, to implement safe schools teaching in the education system, attacks on religious freedom that was not even considered at the time of passing this Bill. Children's right of a mother and father. No Law or Bill should be passed through of Parliament or our Constitution that discriminates on ones human rights and excludes the rights and freedom's of others to choose, in order to push through the rights of the LGBTQ. You see the severe consequences of this in Canada which had lead to passing other un lawful laws. This is un Constitutional and un-Australian. This Bill in itself comes against our Constitutional human rights and should be challenged in the High Court and repealed, and the Marriage Act returned to it original form from over 50 years ago.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">There's an estimated 150 million tonnes of plastic spread throughout the world's ocean already, increasing by the equivalent of a garbage truck full of plastic every minute worldwide. Recent studies indicate that by 2050, the amount of plastic in the ocean will outweigh fish. Among the top 10 items found in the ocean are plastic straws and stirrers. Most recycling facilities don't process the type of plastic used in plastic straws, which means most end up either in landfill or washed down stormwater drains and into the ocean when not properly disposed of. To put that in perspective: over 10 million plastic straws are used in Australia every single day. Feasible, alternate options to plastic straws already exist and include eco-friendly biodegradable straws, some of which can decompose within 35 days of use. Plastic straws on the other hand take approximately 200 years to break down.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Tens of thousands of elephants are still being slaughtered every year for their ivory. This rate of poaching is pushing African elephants ever closer to extinction, and the window of opportunity for saving them is rapidly shrinking. Since poaching for the ivory trade is the most pressing threat facing Africa's elephants and rhinos, the closure of all ivory markets, both international and domestic, is critical for their survival. Global ivory trade and poaching accounts for almost $15 to 20 billion annually. Illegal trade in wildlife is a lucrative market for criminals. While Australia has banned import of ivory, thousands of ivory items are sold (domestically) each year through auction houses, often without documentation proving whether they are genuine antiques. This allows ivory to be illegally imported through other means.</span>

Under the new legislation, a single Australian citizen or Permanent Resident who wishes to be the assurer for his or her overseas parents must have an annual income of at least $86,606.52. Nevertheless, people who have a spouse or children will face even higher income threshold. Such change undermines the intrinsic value of family relationships and the principle of equity. Moreover, grandparents can provide childcare allowing sponsors to go from being one-income to two-income households, which takes pressure off the welfare system. This policy opens Australia's migration law up to the charge of being directed more towards the rich and unflavored the underprivileged. Furthermore, people who have lodged their applications for 143 visa before 1 April 2018 are in confusion since there is no transitional policy imposed.</span>

Gives No Transition Period for the existing immigration applicants. (The current visa 143 application had waited for more than three years to be allocated to the case officer, which was list as 1.5 years when applied in 2015) 2. Has not been officially announced to the public before came into effect. Human service and immigration departments provided inconsistent information and reported have not trained for this. 3. Has doubled the financial requirement which is over the statistically Australian average income. Regardless of the willingness of partners to be involved in assurance or its finical independence, the number of partners are included in the calculation. 4.

              <span class="HPS-Small">We have seen photographic evidence of neglect and callous disregard for the basic welfare of animals by the operators of vessels used for the export of live sheep from Australian ports to overseas destinations in the Middle East. The live sheep export trade materially benefits the farmers and exporters who shamelessly consign their animals to these operators for profit regardless of the suffering it causes. It benefits those overseas traders who capitalise on the misery of animals which lack protection of any kind from unspeakable acts of cruelty and barbarism both during their sea voyage and onshore upon arrival. If, as a nation, we are to describe ourselves as 'civilised' then the live sheep export trade cannot be allowed to continue in any form.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Since energy efficient lighting standards started and the phase out of standard incandescent light bulbs, people with light sensitivity conditions have suffered worldwide including in Australia. Restricting standard incandescent light bulbs can impact on the social and community life of people with light sensitivity conditions. Even modern energy efficient homes with the amount of wattage in lighting being restricted are not suitable for light sensitivity conditions. Light covers are not enough to stop harsh cool and daylight coloured lighting in places like shops and shopping centres. For people with sensitivity to flickering bulbs, the use of CFLs or LEDs can trigger problems – either from the bulbs normal operation or when they fail. In the case of people with Irlen Syndrome the best lighting is indirect natural lighting or incandescent lighting. I have autism and I have been affected by energy efficient lighting to which sunglasses or Irlen lenses do not resolve the problem – I still experience sensory overload. I experience sensory overload in any area that has energy efficient lighting.

              <span class="HPS-Small">An average 72% of respondents polled in April 2018 agreed with the Australian Green's proposal to legalise Cannabis for adult use and the right to home cultivation. Over one third of Australians admit to using Cannabis but indications are that many more use it covertly on a regular basis and would only admit the same in a secret ballot. Laws prohibiting personal use, possession and cultivation of Cannabis have been ineffective, and have effectively ruined the lives of many otherwise law-abiding citizens. They have driven users to the black market and allowed criminals to flourish, putting public safety at great risk. This is counter to current harm reduction policy. Societal harms and deaths from alcohol and illicit/prescription drug abuse have noticeably reduced in jurisdictions where Cannabis has been legalised. It is not unreasonable to expect similar in Australia. We acknowledge Australia is bound by outdated international treaty obligations, but note many nations have moved forward, basing decisions on current scientific evidence that disputes 'reefer madness' propaganda on which prohibition of Cannabis was based, last century. Economically, taxpayer funds currently expended on police/judicial resources to enforce Cannabis laws could be better utilised elsewhere, while taxation from sales of legal Cannabis has the potential to raise millions of dollars. Essentially the benefits far outweigh the risks.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Suggesting that the House revise their decisions to keep the Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT) for sufferers of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the 'experimental' category. The reason for this request is due to the large number of people suffering with MS in Australia being unable to receive the treatment in their own country due to two major factors: 1. The trials of AHSCT are only being run in two hospitals in Australia and one of these hospital's trial for the treatment doesn't solely focus on it's success for MS patients. 2. The criteria for an individual to be granted access to this trial in Australia is very strict which means that only a very small number of people with MS can undergo the treatment. Current medications and treatments that Australia has to offer for MS sufferers include medications like Tysabri (Natalizumab). These treatments have been used for years in Australia despite obvious health risks, for example, Tysabri's biggest health risks include; increased risk of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) and possible Death. Despite the huge risks these treatments are allowed by the Australian Health Ethics Committee, so why can't AHSCT be allowed in Australia for those suffering from MS?</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Wicks </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions concerning a petition on removing the monopoly market from the five Victorian electricity distribution networks (petition number EN0297).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Australian Government (the Government) has a leadership role in energy policy, state and territory governments retain primary responsibility for energy issues. The wholesale market, transmission and distribution networks and retail markets are currently regulated by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) under the National Electricity Laws and Rules. In accordance with the National Electricity Objective, the regulatory framework seeks to deliver services in the long term interests of consumers in terms of price, quality, safety, reliability and security of supply across all sectors of the market. The AER is equipped with powers to investigate and enforce compliance with the national energy legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The current electricity market framework encourages competition where it is likely to deliver efficient outcomes, for example in the generation and retail sectors. However, electricity networks are a natural monopoly. The high capital cost of electricity networks make it efficient to have a single provider of network services in a particular geographic area. Having multiple distribution network providers across the five Victorian distribution market areas would increase costs for consumers. To protect customers from paying too much for monopoly network service providers, the AER regulates their revenue, setting a ceiling on the costs they can recover through electricity bills.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government understands community concern about rising electricity prices and has sought to improve regulation across the energy sector. The Government has boosted the AER's funding by $67.4 million and provided it with additional market monitoring powers. We have also improved the network regulation process by abolishing the Limited Merits Review regime, which allowed network businesses to increase electricity bills by appealing the AER's decisions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Treasurer has also asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to review retail electricity prices. The review will consider, among other things, the</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">competitiveness of offers available to larger business customers, and take into account wholesale electricity market conduct, price and cost issues. The ACCC Retail Electricity Pricing Inquiry: Preliminary Report was published on 16 October 2017; its final report due 30 June 2018.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding the setting of solar feed in tariffs, the COAG Energy Council has agreed that feed in tariffs should reflect the fair value of the electricity exported by the household. In Victoria, the Essential Services Commission calculates a minimum rate, currently 11.3 cents per kilowatt hour, which retailers must pay (although retailers may offer a higher amount). The costs of premium feed in tariff rates that pay a rate significantly above the fair value of electricity are recovered from other consumers and contribute to higher prices.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Climate change is a global issue that requires international action. The Australian Government (the Government) is playing its role in addressing climate change, while ensuring we maintain energy security and affordability and a strong economy. The Paris Agreement is a landmark collective global response to the threat of climate change. It has been ratified by 170 parties to the UNFCCC, accounting for 86 per cent of global emissions and 90 per cent of the world's population. This reaffirms our commitment to effective international action on climate change, including Australia's target to reduce emissions to 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is moving forward with a plan to deliver an affordable and reliable energy system that will also help meet our international commitments. The National Energy Guarantee (the Guarantee) is a mechanism designed to bring together energy and climate policy, while maintaining system reliability. The Guarantee is a credible pro-market policy that does not involve subsidies or taxes. It is estimated to reduce household electricity bills by an average of $120 per year from 2020. The Guarantee will encourage new investment in the lowest cost technologies, making energy more affordable for households and businesses.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The case contended in the petition, that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Royal Style and Titles Act 1973 </span>(the 1973 RST Act) and its relation to the oaths a monarch takes upon accession to the throne has in some way led to defective government, is not well founded.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The inquiry in part concerns the Australian Parliament's authority to alter the Royal Style and Titles. To that end, it is useful to refer to the preamble to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Royal Style and Titles Act 1953 </span>which recites matters informing that authority, including the following (in summary):</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">whereas the preamble to the Statute of Westminster 1931 recites that it would accord with the established constitutional position of all the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations that any alteration in the law touching the Royal Style and Titles should, after the enactment of that Statute, 'require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom',</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      35.45pt;&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:-6.1pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">that, in December 1952, it had been agreed between the Prime Ministers and other representatives of the Commonwealth governments that the then Style and Titles did not accord with current constitutional relationships within the British Commonwealth and that a new form was needed to 'reflect the special position of the Sovereign as Head of the Commonwealth',</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      35.45pt;&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:-6.1pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">that, it was further agreed it would accord 'with the established constitutional position that each member country should use for its own purposes a form of the Royal Style and Titles which suits its own particular circumstances but retains a common description of the Sovereign as 'Queen of Her other Realms and Territories and Head of the Commonwealth', and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      35.45pt;&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:-6.1pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">that it was also agreed that if any country of the British. Commonwealth proposed a change in the form of the Royal Style and Titles there would be consultation between all the Commonwealth governments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As those recitals contemplate, with the exception of standard references to Her Majesty The Queen's title as 'Head of the Commonwealth' and to the Queen's 'other Realms and Territories', each member country can use a form of Royal Style and Titles to suit its own particular circumstances, which can also be changed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To the extent the inquiry is concerned with the 'effect' of the 1973 RST Act, that Act enacts the Australian Parliament's assent to the adoption by Her Majesty The Queen of the current form of Royal Style and Titles for use in Australia and its territories. That form, which refers in part to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of Australia and Head of the Commonwealth, is consistent with Australia's independence, its establishment as a constitutional monarchy and its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the second reading speech for the Royal Style and Titles Bill 1973, on 24 May 1973, the then Prime Minister, the Hon Gough Whitlam AC QC, said 'it is appropriate that [the changes] be made with the consent and approval of both the Houses of the Parliament [as it] is they which, with Her Majesty, are able to express in form of law the appropriate description of the constitutional position of the Queen'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a result of Section 42 of the Australian Constitution and the attached note in the Schedule to the Constitution, the change to the Royal Style and Titles has no effect on the oaths or affirmations taken by Senators and Members of Parliament.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Royal Style and Titles Act 1973 </span>was for the Australian Parliament to assent to the adoption by Her Majesty The Queen of the form of Royal Style and Titles for use in Australia and its territories. The form of Royal Style and Titles as it applies to Australia is consistent with Australia's independence, its establishment as a constitutional monarchy and its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under Australia's Constitution, the Parliament has the power to make laws for the Commonwealth of Australia, but laws that have passed both Houses of the Parliament require the Royal Assent before they are enacted. Following the passage of the Royal Style and Titles Bill 1973 through both Houses of the Parliament, Her Majesty The Queen personally gave Her assent to that Bill on 19 October 1973. As such the following Royal Style and Titles is the form that applies to the Commonwealth of Australia and its territories (which, as it applies in this Act, has the same meaning as Australia and its territories):</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Ombudsman investigates complaints from people who believe they have been treated unfairly or unreasonably by an Australian Government agency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Ombudsman is responsible for ensuring that administrative decisions made by Government are fair and accountable. The Ombudsman cannot override decisions of agencies, however aims to resolve matters through consultation and negotiation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Complaints from serving or former members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) are investigated by the Defence Force Ombudsman. The office may also consider specific requests from Defence to undertake complex or sensitive investigations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Similarly, the Defence Force Ombudsman can make recommendations about administrative decisions made by Defence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 December 2016 the role of the Defence Force Ombudsman was expanded to include an abuse reporting function for serving and former Defence members, and civilians deployed on operations. This provides a confidential mechanism to report sexual abuse,</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ADF is responsible for the protection of the nation and operates in unique circumstances. Due to the nature of military service, the conditions and allowances for members of the ADF are complex and vastly different to those for members of the Australian Public Service. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If an ADF member is not satisfied with an administrative decision made by the ADF they can escalate their concerns through their chain of command. Alternatively they can contact the personnel management unit in their respective Service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">ADF members also have access to the Redress of Grievance process which is a legislated framework by which they can submit formal complaints about matters that relate to their military service. All complaints under this process are given fresh consideration on the merits in order to reach a decision on the issue separate to any decision made at first instance by the chain of command. The process is overseen by the Inspector-General of the ADF who is a statutory office holder, accountable to the Minister, and who operates independently from the normal chain of command. Under the legislation, the Inspector-General of the ADF must consider every complaint and may make findings and recommendations including the provision of a report to relevant parties and any Defence officials whose actions might be required to grant the redress.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to this internal audit and review function, the Inspector General of the ADF provides the Chief of the Defence Force with an avenue by which alleged failures of the system, systemic or otherwise, may be examined and brought to the attention of command as necessary.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Legal Assistance is available to ADF members for matters related to ADF service. Examples include questioning/charging under the Defence Force Discipline Act, Redress of Grievances, Replies to Notice to Show Cause and Termination Notices, affected persons under inquiry or investigation and Medical Employment Classification Review Board.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">External to Defence, members may access the Ombudsman, the Australian Human Rights Commission on matters about unlawful discrimination and breaches of human rights, or seek judicial review of decisions through the Federal courts. In the latter case, the Federal courts have the power to revoke decisions affecting members.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding petition EN0421, in relation to geoengineering and weather modification to prevent climate change.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government (the Government) accepts the science of climate change and takes its primary advice on climate science from the Bureau of Meteorology and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Office. This advice aligns with information provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other national and international organisations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is providing strong action on climate change, including through policies like the Emissions Reduction Fund (the ERF). The ERF encourages activities to store carbon through land-use changes such as afforestation, reforestation and soil carbon sequestration. To date, Emissions Reduction Fund projects have secured over 190 million tonnes of emissions reductions, which will contribute to Australia's 2020 and 2030 emissions reduction targets.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is also working internationally to ensure the appropriate regulation of geo-engineering activities. For example, Australia led international negotiations to determine amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and other Matter 1997 </span>(the London Protocol) to regulate ocean fertilisation activities.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The inquiry in part concerns the Australian Parliament's authority to alter the Royal Style and Titles. To that end, it is useful to refer to the preamble to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Royal Style and Titles Act 1953 </span>which recites matters informing that authority, including the following (in summary):whereas the preamble to the Statute of Westminster 1931 recites that it would accord with the established constitutional position of all the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations that any alteration in the law touching the Royal Style and Titles should, after the enactment of that Statute, 'require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom',</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      35.45pt;&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:-6.1pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">that, in December 1952, it had been agreed between the Prime Ministers and other representatives of the Commonwealth governments that the then Style and Titles did not accord with current constitutional relationships within the British Commonwealth and that a new form was needed to 'reflect the special position of the Sovereign as Head of the Commonwealth',</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      35.45pt;&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:-6.1pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">that, it was further agreed it would accord 'with the established constitutional position that each member country should use for its own purposes a form of the Royal Style and Titles which suits its own particular circumstances but retains a common description of the Sovereign as 'Queen of Her other Realms and Territories and Head of the Commonwealth', and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      35.45pt;&#xD;&#xA;        &#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:-6.1pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">that it was also agreed that if any country of the British Commonwealth proposed a change in the form of the Royal Style and Titles there would be consultation between all the Commonwealth governments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As those recitals contemplate, with the exception of standard references to Her Majesty The Queen's title as 'Head of the Commonwealth' and to the Queen's 'other Realms and Territories', each member country can use a form of Royal Style and Titles to suit its own particular circumstances, which can also be changed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 1 May 1973, in a ministerial statement, the then Prime Minister, the Hon Gough Whitlam AC QC, foreshadowed his Government's intention to introduce a Bill to change the Royal Style and Titles in the 1953 Act. Mr Whitlam stated he had spoken to Her Majesty The Queen and had Her "... full concurrence in an amendment, if the Australian Parliament approves, which would result in dropping the specific reference to the United Kingdom and the reference 'Defender of the Faith'. Explaining that the 1953 formulation was 'not now sufficiently distinctively Australian', Mr Whitlam also said that the 'Defender of the Faith' reference 'has no historical or constitutional relevance in Australia'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Subsequently, the Royal Style and Titles Bill 1973 was introduced into the House of Representatives on 24 May 1973. In the second reading speech, Mr Whitlam reiterated that the reference to 'Defender of the Faith' had no historical or constitutional relevance for Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a final observation, I note that the term 'Defender of the Faith' is not used in the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act. The form of Royal Style and Titles adopted for Australia is consistent with Australia's independence, its establishment as a constitutional monarchy and its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government takes its legal obligations seriously and is committed to acting in accordance with domestic and international law. While the Government's border protection policies — including regional processing — are tough, they are necessary to secure Australia's borders, stamp out people smuggling and prevent people risking their lives at sea. Addressing irregular migration through strong border policies has also restored confidence in the integrity of, and support for, Australia's generous humanitarian resettlement program.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Wicks</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your letter of 26 March 2018 concerning petition number EN0454 regarding the cost of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) prescriptions for Australians under the age of 18.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition called for lowering of the price of PBS prescription medications to $5.30 for Australians under the age of 18.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to providing affordable access to necessary medicines for all Australians. PBS medications are available to all Australian residents who hold a current Medicare card. Eligible patients will pay a co-payment of up to $39.50 per prescription or up to $6.40 per prescription if they hold a concession card.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A PBS medication for an Australian under the age of 18 can be obtained at the concession card rate if they or their parent hold a health care card or low income health care card. Further, a holder of one of these cards can ask their pharmacist to pass on the allowable $1.00 discount which would result in a co-payment of $5.40.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are a wide range of circumstances that would enable an Australian under the age of 18 or their parent or guardian to obtain a health care card. These circumstances include: personal income below $552 dollars per week; being a recipient of Youth Allowance; or a parent being a recipient of the highest rate of Family Tax Benefit Part A.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Details about eligibility for health care cards and how to apply are available on the Department of Human Services website at www.humanservices.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Immigration Detention</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Wicks</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 26 March 2018 enclosing Petition EN0480, concerning visits to immigration detention facilities (IDFs).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Home Affairs welcomes visitors into its 1DFs and recognises that visits to detainees are important to their health and well-being.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department, through its operational arm, the Australian Border Force (ABF), strives to create a secure immigration detention network (IDN) and a safe environment for detainees, visitors and employees, and implements policies, procedures and processes designed to mitigate identified risks, whilst making its processes as simple, efficient and stress-free as possible.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While Australia's immigration detention population previously comprised mainly illegal maritime arrivals, the current profile indicates that those who have had their visas cancelled under the character provisions of section 501 of the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:none underline;">Migration Act 1958 </span>predominate. Of the latter group, many have been found guilty of serious criminal offences.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 11 September 2017, a revised outside food policy was implemented across the ION. The Department is aware that various food items have been used to smuggle contraband into IDFs in the past. Under the revised policy, visitors are welcome to bring food to share within designated visitors' areas, on the condition that it is commercially packaged and labelled, factory sealed with a valid expiry date and not contained in any metal or glass packaging. These measures ensure crucial food health and safety standards are maintained and enhance the security of detainees, staff and visitors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department already caters for various cultural and individual needs through its catering services within the IDN and detainees are able to contribute suggestions to the creation of the menus.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Around 10,000 people visit IDFs across Australia every month. Set visiting times are necessary to ensure that all detainees have fair and equitable access to visitors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 22 January 2018, changes to the visitors' management policy came into effect to increase the safety of all visitors, detainees and staff, including by ensuring that the Department has accurate information about the identity of people seeking to enter an 1DF. The Department must be sure that the people coming into immigration detention facilities are who they say they are and can be properly risk assessed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Visitors who are 18 years or older seeking to visit an IDF must provide 100 points of identity documents (ID), including photo ID. An ID guideline was introduced as the standard for the entry of personal visitors into IDFs and is available on the Department's website at: http://www.homeaffairs.gov.autabout/immigration­detention-in-australia/detention-facilities/visiting-an-immigration-detention-facility. If an individual has concerns about the ability to produce the required ID, they may contact the local particular facility.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Prior to the implementation of the revised visitor policy and the introduction of the online application system, the Department consulted widely with stakeholders, including but not limited to, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) and the Australian Red Cross (ARC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Visitor applications for personal visitors are to be lodged online five business days before the proposed visit. The online visitor application has simplified and streamlined the process for visitors to an 1DF.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If the online option is not readily accessible, a paper application can still be lodged with the relevant IDF. In certain circumstances (short-term detention, emergency, long-distance visitors, or other compassionate reasons), applications for a personal visit lodged less than five days before the proposed visit date may be considered at the discretion of the local ABF Detention Superintendent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Family or friends wishing to visit a person in immigration detention can obtain information on the Department's website. Information for volunteers, advocacy and community groups, including school groups, wishing to visit multiple detainees is also available.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Visitors are able to bring some items into an 1DF, including games and art supplies, however, certain conditions apply. Further information is available at:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Services provided at IDFs in Australia are subject to parliamentary scrutiny and accountability. IDFs are regularly visited by the Australian Human Rights Commission, and the Commonwealth Ombudsman's Office, both of which can investigate complaints and advise the Department on possible improvements. The Australian Research Council also conducts periodic humanitarian visits to all IDFs and provides the Department with recommendations.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Wicks </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 26 March 2018 regarding petition number EN0481. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government considers immunisation an important health measure for children and their families as it is the safest and most effective way to prevent the spread of many diseases. This is a public health issue. The Government has determined that while parents have the right to decide not to vaccinate their children, their decision will not be endorsed by the provision of taxpayer funds in the form of the Child Care Benefit, Child Care Rebate or the Family Tax Benefit Part A end-of-year supplement. It is important to note that children with medical contraindications or natural immunity (certified by an appropriate medical practitioner) are exempt from the requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The overwhelming body of medical and scientific evidence supports the promotion of vaccination for the prevention of potentially crippling, debilitating and deadly diseases. All vaccines used in Australia are thoroughly tested for safety and effectiveness, and are rigorously tested on thousands of people in progressively larger clinical trials.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While vaccines, like other medicines, can have side effects, all vaccines used in Australia provide benefits that greatly outweigh the small risk of an adverse event. The majority of side effects following immunisation are minor and short-lived, the most common being local reactions at the injection site, fever or tiredness. Serious side effects from vaccination are extremely rare. Adverse events following immunisation at any age should be reported through the usual reporting mechanisms in your state or territory or to the Therapeutic Goods Administration through the 'report a problem' link via its website at www.tga.gov.au. Legislation for this measure was passed through Parliament on 23 November 2015 and was accompanied by a Statement of Compatibility with Human Rights, in accordance with the Government's normal process. The measure was also examined by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, which reported in its human rights scrutiny report, the Thirty-seventh Report of the 44th Parliament, tabled on 2 May 2016 that the measure is compatible with international human rights law.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 28 March 2018 regarding petition PN0080 on the maritime boundary between Australia and Timor-Leste.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 6 March 2018, I was pleased to sign an historic treaty establishing permanent maritime boundaries between Australia and Timor-Leste. The treaty was brokered by the Conciliation Commission established under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) - which was the first of its kind.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The UNCLOS Commission and both parties agree the treaty is balanced,</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">equitable and consistent with international law. Timor-Leste's Chief Negotiator, Kay Rala Xanana Gusmao, said the treaty establishes "a fair border between our two countries, based on international law".</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The treaty delivers benefits for both countries. Australia and Timor-Leste have agreed that we will exercise joint rights over the seabed containing the Greater Sunrise field. Seventy or eighty per cent of the revenue from developing Greater Sunrise will flow to Timor-Leste, depending on the final development concept to be agreed upon by Timor-Leste and Australia.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Wicks</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter regarding the twenty petitions received by the Petitions Committee on the impacts of climate change.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government (the Government) is taking action on climate change and contributing to global efforts to reduce emissions. As part of the Paris Agreement, Australia has committed to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. This will see Australia's emissions per person halve and the emissions intensity of our economy reduce by two-thirds. On this basis, Australia's target is among the strongest of major economies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Addressing the impacts of climate change is a priority for the Pacific region. Through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Government works closely with Pacific island countries and regional organisations to build resilience to the impacts of climate change. We have sustained and increased funding to sectors affected by climate change such as fisheries, and for disaster preparedness.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's policies to reduce emissions are working and we will meet our international commitments. We are reducing emissions through the Emissions Reduction Fund, providing incentives to Australian businesses, communities and farmers for adopting new practices and technologies that reduce emissions. The Renewable Energy Target ensures 23.5 per cent of Australia's electricity comes from renewable sources by 2020 and the National Energy Productivity Plan is reducing emissions through more efficient use of energy. The Government is also helping households install rooftop solar panels and solar hot water systems through rebates under the Renewable Energy Target.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition the recently announced National Energy Guarantee (the Guarantee) will require energy retailers and some large users across the National Electricity Market to deliver reliable and lower emissions energy generation each year. The Guarantee is estimated to reduce household electricity bills by an average of $120 per year from 2020. The Government will continue to work with the independent Energy Security Board and the states through the Council of Australian Governments to implement these reforms.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Carmichael Coal Mine is situated in outback Queensland, approximately 300 kilometres west of the Great Barrier Reef. The mine will not have any direct impacts on the reef. The emissions arising from the use of coal from this and other mines are addressed by national and international measures to deal with climate change more broadly. The complex, global nature of emissions is best addressed with such measures, rather than by trying to connect climate change impacts to individual mining projects.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government (the Government) is committed to supporting the transition to a lower emissions economy, while at the same time, providing sustainable, secure and affordable energy to industry and households. The Renewable Energy Target (RET) is a Government scheme designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the electricity sector by encouraging additional generation of electricity from renewable sources. It is expected to lift the share of renewables to around 23.5 per cent of Australia's electricity generation by 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's strong record on renewable energy has led to an unprecedented wave of investment in renewable energy currently underway, supported by the RET. More new build renewable projects came online in 2017 than in any previous year. Clean energy investment was Australia's highest on record at A$11 billion, which placed Australia 7th of all countries in the world. There was more rooftop solar power installed across Australia than in the history of the renewable energy industry. Australia has the world's highest rate of solar panels, with one in five Australian households now having solar panels on their roof.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Protecting precious water resources from impacts of large coal mines is a priority of the Government. The Carmichael Coal Mine and Rail Project approval includes conditions for the protection of water, including a requirement for Adani to offset the predicted annual water take of the mine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the exact number of people estimated to be employed in the Carmichael Coal Mine and Rail project's construction and operational phases is a subject of debate, there is no doubt that the project will create many direct and indirect jobs in Queensland.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:none underline;">Native Title Act 1993 </span>creates processes through which native title is recognised and protected. This includes a process for native title claimants and holders to enter into voluntary<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>agreements with third parties in relation to the use of land and waters on native title. These agreements are referred to as Indigenous Land Use Agreements. Adani Mining Pty Ltd and Wangan and Jagalingou people signed the Adani Carmichael Indigenous Land Use Agreement over part of the Carmichael project area. The Native Title Tribunal registered Adani's Indigenous Land Use Agreement on 8 December 2017.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Adani had expressed interest in accessing the $5 billion Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) to support its North Galilee Basin Railway proposal. On 12 December 2017, the NAIF received formal notification from the Queensland Government that financial assistance should not be provided to Adani's North Galilee Basin Rail Project. As a consequence, in accordance with s13(4) of the NAIF Investment Mandate, the NAIF will not be making an investment decision to provide financial assistance to that project.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In making his decision to approve the project, the then Minister for the Environment, the Hon Greg Hunt MP, had regard to the environmental history of Adani Mining Pty Ltd and its related entities. The information considered was sourced from a range of environmental organisations and the company. Consideration of the company's environmental history was the most comprehensive ever undertaken under the EPBC Act.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The EPBC Act establishes a strong framework for protection of the environment and the conservation of biodiversity.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Wicks</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 26 March 2018 regarding petition number PN0329 calling for an immediate end to the persecution of Falun Gong in China</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government agrees China's ban on Falun Gong and its treatment of practitioners are in breach of international human rights standards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are aware of claims of illegal organ harvesting in China from Falun Gong practitioners. Those claims, if true, are deeply disturbing. While we consider there is insufficient credible evidence to support the Falun Gong's specific allegations, there is little doubt organs have been harvested from executed prisoners for use in medical transplants, at least prior to 2015. Australia strongly opposes this practice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2015, Dr Huang Jiefu, head of China's organ donation committee, announced that only voluntarily donated organs from civilians could be used in transplants from 1 July 2015. While this announcement is welcome, we recognise it will make little difference if it is not properly enforced.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We have raised our concerns over the practice of harvesting organs from executed prisoners directly with the Chinese Government. We will continue to urge China to ensure the 2015 regulations are implemented at all levels.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Wicks</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 6 February 2018 to the Prime Minister, the Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP, regarding Petition EN0420 about child protection. Your letter has been referred to me as I have portfolio responsibility for this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Government acknowledges the importance of ensuring children and young people are safe and well and values the important contribution of kinship and grandparent carers who provide loving homes for children who are unable to live with their parents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, state and territory governments have statutory responsibility for the care and protection of children and young people experiencing, or at risk of, abuse or neglect, including the child protection and out-of-home care systems.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, the number of children suffering abuse and neglect, including the disproportionate number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children affected, is of concern to all governments. As at 30 June 2017, approximately 47,900 children were in out-of-home care. During 2016-17, Aboriginal and Tones Strait Islander children were seven times as likely as non-Indigenous children to have received child protection services, and ten times as likely as non-Indigenous children to be in out-of-home care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

The Framework's <span style="font-style:italic;">Third Action Plan 2015-18 </span>focuses on prevention and early intervention, to better support families and prevent children coming into contact with the child protection system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Commonwealth, state and territory Ministers responsible for community services also meet regularly and work collaboratively to drive improvement for children. In August 2017, Ministers unanimously agreed more needs to be done at all levels of government to improve the safety and wellbeing of children and young people, in particular improving access to permanent, safe and stable homes for children in out-of-home care (`permanency'). Ministers confirmed that early intervention and prevention, particularly for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families, is a priority for all governments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners request a Royal Commission into Child Protective Services across Australia. You may be interested to know that the Senate Community Affairs References Committee held an Inquiry into Out-of-Home Care in 2015.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A number of the Inquiry's recommendations are being addressed through the National Framework and Community Services Ministers' permanency reform work. Improving stability and permanency for children in out-of-home care, a key concern of the Inquiry, will be a priority under the forthcoming Fourth Action Plan of the National Framework.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Community Services Ministers have identified the need for greater consistency in achieving permanency outcomes to ensure children in each state and territory receive: safe and stable care; timely decision-making on a permanent family placement that takes into the account their views; and lifelong relationships and a sense of belonging, identity and connection to culture and community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Principle seeks to ensure state and territory child and family welfare policy, legislation and/or practice places importance on connection to family, community, culture and country for Indigenous children and young people. Fundamental to the Principle is the recognition that Aboriginal and Tones Strait Islander people have the knowledge and experience to make the best decisions concerning their children. Of course, the best interests of the child is always the paramount consideration in child protection decision-making.</span>

Grandparent Advisers are based in the Department of Human Services (DHS) and are trained to provide support, advice and assistance to grandparent carers to access Government payments and services.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mrs Wicks</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 6 February 2018 regarding Petition Number EN0434 that was recently presented in the House of Representatives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition seeks support for an investigation into why the Department of Defence does not support the rezoning of a portion of land (subject site) from 'primary production' to 'residential', in the vicinity of Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Base Edinburgh.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Defence provided comment on the rezoning proposal to the City of Salisbury Council and the South Australian Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure when comment was invited on their draft Rural (Aircraft Noise) Direk Industry and Residential Interface Development Plan Amendment. Defence does not have the authority to approve or reject land planning proposals outside its boundary.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Defence considers numerous criteria when commenting on land use proposals around airfields, including exposure to aircraft noise and public safety issues. I am advised that the petitioners' land lies within RAAF Base Edinburgh's 20-25 Australian Noise Exposure Forecast contour and Accident Potential Zone 1. Defence does not support residential development in areas subject to high levels of aircraft noise or in areas where there is an increased risk of harm in the unlikely case of an aviation incident. There is an inherent risk of accident in locations such as this, as aircraft are most vulnerable to incidents while flying at low speed and at low level.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Defence acknowledges that residential development already exists on properties near the subject site. Nonetheless, Defence does not support more residential development in close proximity to RAAF Base Edinburgh as this would expose even more householders to high levels of aircraft noise.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am advised that the South Australian Government shares Defence's concern about incompatible development around this Defence establishment and has asked the City of Salisbury Council to amend their proposed rezoning of the petitioners' property.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to Per- and Poly-fluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), I am advised that the Defence PFAS Investigation team has undertaken soil testing at the subject site and all samples have returned results below the reporting level. On this basis, PFAS has no effect on the future development of the site.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current value of the petitioners' land reflects its mixture of 'primary production' and 'residential' zonings. The land value will not decrease because Defence wishes to maintain the existing zoning.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 26 March 2018 regarding petition EN0455, which requests that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Common Informers (Parliamentary Disqualifications) Act 1975 </span>(Cth) be amended to increase the daily penalty for sitting while disqualified from $200 per day to 50 penalty units per day. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this petition to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Unlike fines for offences against the criminal law, which are paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the penalty under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Common Informers (Parliamentary Disqualifications) Act 1975 </span>is payable to a person who sues for it in a court of competent jurisdiction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As drafted, the Australian Government considers the penalties in the Act strike an appropriate balance between sanction for Senators and Members who sit while disqualified (which would be imposed in addition to disqualification from Parliament), and the interest in not providing a vehicle by which a member of the public may enrich himself or herself. It has no plans to amend the Act as suggested.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for raising this matter with me.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your letter of 28 March 2018 concerning a petition requesting the Australian Government's approval of listing nusinersen (marketed as SpinrazaTM) on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) by June 2018 (petition number EN0462). I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am pleased to inform you that Spinraza will be available through the PBS for the treatment of Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3a spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) for all patients under the age of 18 from 1 June 2018.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government will invest $241 million for this PBS listing. Without Australian Government subsidy, patients would otherwise pay more than $367,850 a year for the medicine. This PBS listing on 1 June 2018 will now mean they only pay a maximum of $39.50 per script, with concessional patients paying just $6.40.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further details about the PBS listing of Spinraza can be found on my website at www.greghunt.com.au and searching 'spinal muscular atrophy' in the search tool.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the interim, there may be alternative options for patients to access Spinraza at a reduced cost outside of the PBS arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The patient's treating physician may wish to contact Biogen to see if they may be able to provide compassionate access or would be willing to supply Spinraza to them at a reduced price.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Decisions on matters such as this are made by the company concerned, not the Government. The contact details for Biogen can be found on its website at www.biogen.com.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the Government provides funds to the states and territories to assist with the costs of providing public hospital services, which can include assistance with the costs of medicines that patients are unable to afford.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The patient's treating physician might consider making an application, on their behalf, to the drug and therapeutics committee of a local public hospital to request assistance with the cost of treatment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:02</span>):  On 29 May the committee presented its report on the inquiry into the e-petitioning system. The report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Making</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> v</span><span style="font-style:italic;">oices </span><span style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eard</span>, found that the e-petitioning system has been a great success in enhancing community participation in the petitioning process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Users of the system have been able to create, share and sign petitions electronically since the beginning of this parliament. Because of this new system, the overall number of petitions received by the committee has doubled from previous recent parliaments and continues to rise. This is a great example of how improving access to parliamentary processes fosters community engagement with the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also found that there were some areas where the system could be enhanced to improve user experience and accessibility. Recommendations in the report include enhancements to webpage design, a campaign to promote the availability of e-petitioning, and a review of general practice and procedure relating to e-petitioning and petitioning more broadly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="265931" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr MORTON:</span>
                    </a>  It is with great pleasure that I rise today to speak about the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories inquiry report into Australia's Antarctic territory. Australians were some of the earliest explorers on the Antarctic continent, with our nation's involvement beginning in the late 1800s and continuing to the present day. Some of Australia's earliest Antarctic scientists, including Douglas Mawson, are synonymous with Australia exploration of the continent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mawson's station was opened in 1954 and became Australia's first permanent scientific research presence in Antarctica. The Australian Antarctic Program positions our nation amongst the world's most significant contributors on this continent. Australia's Antarctic territory covers 42 per cent of the entire Antarctic continent, with Australia maintaining three permanent research stations as well as a seasonal aerodrome to support our extensive research and national interests. Australia is an original signatory to the Antarctic treaty and is recognised as Antarctic leader. However, Australia's claim is only officially recognised by four nations—the United Kingdom, New Zealand, France and Norway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years, Australia's Antarctic territory has seen growing activity from other nations, including the establishment of Russian, Chinese, French and Italian facilities. These nations continue to invest strongly in their Antarctic infrastructure. Australia is also investing in its Antarctic infrastructure, securing our future contributions to Antarctic research and maintaining our role as a leader in Antarctic affairs. The committee recognises that continued involvement and investment in Antarctica is necessary for supporting Australia's national interests and continued leadership in Antarctica. Failure to invest will have significant negative effects on Australia's standing in Antarctica and our leadership role that we play.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, the government has announced important investments in infrastructure that will significantly enhance Australia's scientific capabilities and capacity. In May, the government announced it would proceed with a paved runway to provide year-round access to the Davis research station. This is consistent with the committee's recommendation and demonstrates Australia's commitment to protect its long-term interests in Antarctica.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is also investing in a new Antarctic ice breaker, which is due to arrive in Hobart in 2020. These investments will provide a more modern and efficient basis upon which Australia's international reputation in Antarctic science can continue to grow. In particular, these investments will provide improved capacity for international engagement and opportunities for Australia's Antarctic scientists to collaborate with their colleagues from other nations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another key opportunity identified in this report is the continued development of Hobart as an Antarctic hub, as a well-situated capital to capitalise on Australia's renewed Antarctic focus. A number of initiatives, including enhancements to aviation capability at Hobart Airport, a proposed Antarctic science hub and a potential development of Antarctic tourism, are valuable opportunities for Hobart and for Tasmania. The city's expanding Antarctic potential may also see increased engagement with other international Antarctic programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's inquiry launched in June 2017 and received well-informed contributions from key stakeholders in Australia's Antarctic sector, including a number of Commonwealth and Tasmanian government agencies, the Antarctic Science community, academics and those developing infrastructure and other support services in Tasmania to meet the needs of the growing Antarctic sector. Members of the committee spent time in both Hobart and in Antarctica inspecting some of the key facilities of Australia's Antarctic operations. These visits provided the opportunity for the committee to better understand future investment and science investment needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's report considers four key themes—Australia's leadership in governance with respect to Antarctic, the infrastructure and logistical support required to support the success of the Australian Antarctic Program, and Australia's world-class research in Antarctic science and the economic benefits—particularly for Tasmania—that can result from Australia's engagement in the continent. The report's 22 recommendations provide the government with an opportunity to strengthen its work with respect to Antarctica and build on already impressive foundations. In particular, the committee has recommended that the government consider the appointment of an Antarctic ambassador, that Australia's formal inspections under the treaty be increased and that the government capitalise on developments in the city of Hobart for the colocation of relevant Antarctic institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the many contributors to the committee's inquiry, including those who made submissions and gave evidence at public hearings. I would like in particular to thank the staff of the Australian Antarctic Division in Hobart for their commitment to the Australian Antarctic Program and express the committee's appreciation for the open and professional manner in which they engaged in this inquiry. Thank you, finally, to my committee colleagues for their engagement with this inquiry: the secretariat, led by Peggy, Muz and Stephanie. I look forward to Australia's growing contributions to Antarctica over the coming years.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="30540" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRODTMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  As deputy chair of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the report from the inquiry into Australia's Antarctic territory. Australia has a long and proud history of involvement in Antarctica, having significantly contributed to shaping the region both through the Antarctic Treaty System and on the ground. Australia's continued presence on the continent through science and infrastructure has enabled Australia to contribute to world-class research, to shape Antarctic governance and to protect our sovereignty and national interests in the region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Antarctic strategy and 20-year action plan, released in 2014, committed Australia to building and maintaining strong and effective relationships with other nations subject to the Antarctic Treaty System. While the plan outlined an ambitious vision for Australia, what it lacked was that it needed to draw a thread between the strategic importance of Antarctica to Australia's foreign policy and who would take the lead on that body of work. As my colleague the member for Tangney has noted, the committee's report recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade appoint an Antarctic ambassador to help further Australia's interest in Antarctica internationally. There is a precedent for appointing an ambassador to policy areas of strategic or international importance, or both. We have had ambassadors for the environment. We have had ambassadors in a range of different areas. Australia has appointed a cyberambassador who works to identify opportunities for practical international cooperation to ensure Australia has a coordinated, consistent and influential voice on international cyberissues. Given these precedents, the Antarctic ambassador's role will be more than symbolic; it will have an important job. It is a strategic appointment, just like the appointment of the cyberambassador, to promote Australia's Antarctic interests and capabilities on the international stage; it is focused entirely on doing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of nations showing an interest in Antarctica is increasing. This may lead to pressure in the future to change the established norms in the region to allow access to Antarctic mineral resources, which is currently banned under the treaty. As the political and strategic dynamics of Antarctica change over time, Australia will need strong leadership to ensure the treaty remains the best framework in the region. We need to send a strong message through strong leadership, and that can be demonstrated to our international partners by appointing an Antarctic ambassador. The Antarctic ambassador would be based in the Department of Foreign Affairs, in the same way as the cyberambassador, and lead a team whose focus is on the strategic importance of Antarctica to Australia. Another recommendation in the report  is that an office of Antarctic services be created. The Antarctic ambassador, through the office of Antarctic services, would be responsible for promoting Australian scientific research on the international stage and promoting Hobart as Australia's science hub and gateway to Antarctica.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's report also recommended supporting the work of Australia's Antarctic science community by assessing how Australia can retain and further develop its Antarctic science workforce. And they are a phenomenal workforce. Anyone who's had anything to do with the Antarctic Division, or had the wonderful privilege of going down there, has had firsthand experience of the expertise that we have in the science community in Antarctica. Another recommendation of the report was considering how the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre can continue operations beyond June 2019 and implementing a whole-of-government data management strategy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the inquiry, and particularly during the visit to Hobart and Antarctica, I was impressed by the dedication and sense of pride that Australia's Antarctic community has for the work they are doing. They are incredibly proud of the work they do in terms of research, particularly on krill, which is absolutely world leading. The work they do on ice cores is also world leading. People come from Europe, America, Africa and Asia to see the work that's being done on krill and ice cores, as well as the other work being done by the Antarctic Division.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all the contributors to the committee's inquiry, including those who made submissions, gave evidence at public hearings and provided the committee with private briefings. In particular, I'd like to give my thanks to the staff of the Australian Antarctic Division for their dedication and commitment to the Australian Antarctic Program, and I want to express the committee's appreciation for their assistance with this inquiry.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parliamentary reports responding to real and alleged breaches of animal welfare standards date back at least to the early 1980s.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years the drumbeat has grown louder. In the 21st century, people have so much access to information. Undesirable events have never before been so easy to record and distribute. It is more difficult than ever before for those doing the wrong thing to hide breaches of animal welfare standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2011, an ABC <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program screened terrible acts of animal cruelty in Indonesian abattoirs. The weight of community reaction left the then government with little choice but to suspend the live cattle trade until practices in those abattoirs could be changed and modernised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an extraordinarily difficult time for producers and exporters alike. But what grew from it was the Export Supply Chain Assurance System (ESCAS), an internationally recognised animal welfare assurance guarantee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is doubtful the industry would ever have accepted ESCAS if it had not been for the suspension of the trade. There were those who argued the regulation and enforcement of animal welfare standards in other countries was not possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But ESCAS has been a great success story and a proud Labor achievement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ESCAS has placed the live cattle trade on a sustainable footing. The sector continues to earn significant export income, create thousands of jobs along the supply chain, create price competition for cattle producers, and provide a market for those northern producers unable to grow cattle to slaughter weight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of the former Labor government persuaded the live export sector of the need to build and maintain a social licence. That is, community support for the industry, its methods and behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the success of ESCAS and associated efforts, by 2013 it became clear to me that more would need to be done to maintain community support and guarantee compliance with mandated animal welfare standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further incidents in the trade had given weight to claims the regulator was not sufficiently independent and had become captured by the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why in July 2013, a Labor government announced the appointment of an independent Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. As minister at the time, I made an interim appointment pending enabling legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, an election soon followed and the new coalition government chose to let the position lapse. It was a most regrettable decision and one driven entirely by political opportunism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There can be no doubt the decision to abolish the inspector-general has cost the live export industry dearly. It sent a clear message to the industry that the new government would be more tolerant of animal abuse. That it saw no need for a further strengthening of the regulatory system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The situation was exacerbated by the antics of then Minister Joyce, who encouraged and nurtured the wrong culture within both the industry and the regulator. A culture which in turn promoted a cavalier approach to animal welfare matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the independent oversight of the regulator had continued, we may never have heard of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Express</span>, and the live sheep sector may have had a future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In introducing this private member's bill, I make an appeal to all members to back the re-establishment of an independent statutory officer to watch over the regulation of the live export sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">His or her role will be to ensure correct animal welfare standards are maintained and when there is an alleged breach, the regulator fully and properly investigates the matter, comes to right conclusions and imposes appropriate sanctions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There can be no argument against the re-establishment of the Inspector-General for Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Arguments it will result in more red tape for farmers are just silly and mischievous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inspector-general will have no reason to interact with producers in the red meat sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This proposition now enjoys, it's worth noting, the support of the live export industry. It now just needs the support of this parliament. A sustainably profitable agriculture sector needs a strong and sustainable animal welfare assurance system, and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="DZW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:20</span>):  I second the motion, and I am pleased to speak on this private member's bill proposed by the shadow minister for agriculture, which will establish an Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. The Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports Bill 2018 creates an independent statutory officer who will have oversight of the Commonwealth regulator in animal welfare matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In government in 2013, Labor appointed an interim Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. Unfortunately, the then new coalition government did not proceed with the legislation necessary to make the position permanent. That was the wrong decision, which has proven to be devastating for animal protection. The Turnbull government has, shamefully, been consistent in its opposition to the appointment of an inspector-general. Like the Inspector-General of Biosecurity, an Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports will deliver the robust regulatory oversight which the community is demanding and that the Productivity Commission has backed. These actions are needed, along with a suite of measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've made it clear that a Shorten Labor government will, at the first opportunity, put an end to the northern summer live sheep trade. The evidence on this is very clear, and the community sentiment is very clear too. The northern summer live sheep trade is just not possible, because it is cruel and it is extremely harmful for those animals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've stated that, during the necessary transition period, we'll put regulations in place that will ensure the highest standards, proper oversight and appropriate sanctions for breaches, including the establishment of the inspector-general as an independent statutory position. The inspector-general will be responsible for advising on the protection of animals in all Commonwealth-regulated activities and will report directly to the minister on issues like live animal exports, animal welfare standards and other required guidelines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inspector will also work with the states and territories to establish an independent office of animal welfare to oversee animal protection and welfare activities nationally. This re-establishment of state and territory cooperation on animal welfare matters—abolished by the Abbott-Turnbull government—will ensure a consistent national approach and continuous monitoring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In government, Labor will conduct a thorough review of the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System to ensure that it works as effectively and efficiently as possible. This plays a very critical role in reassuring Australia's agricultural producers, their customers and the broader community that animal welfare is being protected at every stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, in government, Labor will provide more transparency and accountability around the live export trade. For a long time, Labor has been calling for these changes—as have many in the community. Like everyone in this House, I have received thousands of items of correspondence over the years about the live export trade. This is an issue that the other side just cannot ignore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It took the horrifying <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express </span>incident to get any response at all from the Turnbull government—a response that did nothing to fix the systemic issues with the long-haul sheep trade, because this is a government beset by party division, whose own members threaten to cross the floor on this issue. They've now withdrawn even their very small, token measures. It's clear the Prime Minister is not willing to deal with the abuses that have occurred on his watch. This is a truly heartless approach, and it is a stain on Australia's reputation as a world-class food exporter of clean green food of the highest quality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The long-haul sheep trade has been in decline for two decades. It has been consistently mired in criticism, reviews and suspensions. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express </span>incident has made it blatantly clear: the regulation isn't working. The current system is cruel. You simply cannot pack 50,000 or 60,000 sheep onto a boat for four weeks and then sail them through some of the hottest and most humid climates in the world and expect animal welfare expectations to be upheld. That is the reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's proposed five-year transition period will give the industry time to adjust to the changes. It'll be a transition to something better. In contrast to all of that, all we see from the Turnbull government is inaction. In fact, they failed to even list their bill to increase penalties for breaches of the animal welfare standards in the live animal sector. The government has withdrawn the Export Legislation Amendment (Live-stock) Bill 2018 in this sitting week, and they did that following our announcement to move amendments to the bill which, if successful, would have put an immediate stop to the Northern Hemisphere summer live sheep trade and phased out the trade within five years. Yet the government has withdrawn that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the McCarthy review, the government did spruik the fact there were going to be increased penalties as a key response to ongoing breaches of animal welfare standards, yet they have done nothing—just those token efforts—and they've now withdrawn the bill. But Labor stands ready. We stand ready to support increased penalties. We have made that very clear. But what is also very clear is that the evidence is clear. The science is clear and the community sentiment is overwhelmingly clear time and time again: the northern summer live sheep trade must end. And Labor has made that very clear.</span>

It is unfair, and the government members must listen and support this private members' bill.</span>

                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That this bill be now read a second time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I introduce a bill that provides a humane and sustainable response to the protection and processing of asylum seekers and refugees. In particular it ensures the effective protection of people seeking asylum in Australia, and in the Asia-Pacific region more broadly, and is compliant with international law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of this bill cannot be overstated. For too long the community has been misled into believing the choice is one between defending our borders from invaders or having open borders. But there was always another way, that of a genuine regional framework based on decency and the rule of law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget that 12 people have now died in Australian offshore detention centres, all avoidable. But it's never too late to right a wrong and this week, Refugee Week, is a fitting time to move forward with this alternative refugee protection bill that would, among other things, have the effect of seeing all asylum seekers and refugees on Manus and Nauru brought to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I introduce this bill because there needs to be a new conversation about how we, as a civilised nation, respond to people genuinely fleeing for their lives, who have suffered unimaginable atrocities, and who now need our help. We must stop talking about asylum seekers and refugees as a threat to national security and start recognising that Australia has a legal and moral obligation to give protection to asylum seekers, to quickly hear their claims and to provide permanent refuge if those claims are correct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill abolishes unlawful mandatory detention of asylum seekers and refugees and provides for alternatives to detention that are community based. Moreover the bill clearly states that any immigration detention that there might be must be in Australia, lawful, necessary and proportionate, and for the shortest time humanly possible. Any immigration detention should be subject to ongoing judicial review and will be independently monitored on a regular basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill incorporates into Australian domestic law the relevant international instruments to which Australia is a signatory, including the Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the Rights of the Child; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. These instruments, as well as the principle of family unity and the principle of the best interests of the child, are paramount to the development of the asylum seeker and refugee framework I propose here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How will this work? In essence, the bill enables the establishment of a network of centres, located in and run by Asia-Pacific countries, including Australia, where asylum seekers can go to be registered, have their immediate humanitarian needs met and lodge a preference for country of resettlement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the asylum seeker selects Australia and is within the specified quota, this bill establishes a process for assessing their claim in Australia with appropriate oversight, limited time frames and judicial review. The bill does not allow mandatory detention but does prioritise the applicant's immediate needs and is consistent with refugee and international human rights law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The key component of this bill is the Asia-Pacific asylum seeker solution, or APASS, which is a regional framework that the Australian government will initiate in partnership with other Asia-Pacific countries. All countries party to this APASS would be legally bound to provide effective protection for asylum seekers and refugees, as provided under international law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The APASS centres would be located for ease of access for asylum seekers and refugees, and would provide a legal and safe alternative to the service of people smugglers. These centres would be developed in cooperation with and funded by the parties to APASS. New arrivals to an APASS centre will be screened and registered, and a person's immediate humanitarian needs will be met, even if only a temporary basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When asylum seekers register at an APASS centre they will be asked to select three preferred host countries. They may then remain at the APASS centre or be transferred to another centre; although any transfer arrangement must prioritise the applicant's immediate needs, the principle of family unity, international human rights law and responsibility-sharing between APASS member countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If Australia is selected as a preferred host country and other specified criteria are met then the applicant will become an Australian APASS applicant. To accommodate them, Australia will take a specified quota of APASS applicants each year who will be considered for permanent visas in Australia based on their refugee status.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While being processed, each APASS applicant will be assigned an APASS case officer who will be responsible for the processing of the applicant, including access to free independent legal advice, accommodation and financial support. The case officer will also work with authorities to ensure an applicant's visa is processed within the statutory time frame. This bill makes it clear that each step of this process has restricted time frames, appropriate oversight and review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">APASS establishes a mechanism for regional cooperation on the registration, processing and settlement of asylum seekers and refugees in the Asia-Pacific region. It incorporates principles of genuine responsibility and cost-sharing between member states and is able to build on existing forums such as the Bali process, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Asia Dialogue on Forced Migration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, APASS would not only provide safe entry for people seeking protection in Australia but also significantly enhance the region's capacity to respond effectively to the movement of asylum seekers and refugees. A spin-off would be improved responses to regional crises, including better targeted foreign aid to beleaguered countries—a current example being Myanmar—so that asylum seekers and refugees may be safely returned to their country of origin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking of money, Australia's current offshore detention policy has been estimated to cost over half a million dollars per asylum seeker per year. That's simply indefensible. Indeed, in 2014-15, Australia spent more than $1 billion on the offshore detention of 1,577 asylum seekers and refugees. By comparison, the UNHCR budget in 2015, for the whole of the Asia-Pacific area, was about US$157 million—for over 200,000 refugees, half a million IDPs and nearly 1.4 million stateless persons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, let me just say that for APASS to be realised it needs bipartisan support, so I call on the government and the opposition to support the bill. I call on the Australian community also to get behind it and to meet with or phone, write to or email your federal MP and senators and tell them you support this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, a big thank you to everyone who has helped prepare the bill, in particular Kate Allingham from my office, sitting in the advisers box, who has spent months working on it, and the many organisations that have given their time to discuss it, including the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre in Melbourne and the Kaldor Centre at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. I commend this bill to the House, and, in my remaining time, I invite the member for Indi to make a short statement.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:34</span>):  Our treatment of asylum seekers is an important and live issue in my electorate. It's moved beyond national security or breaking the business model to an issue of conscience, values and national identity. My community have asked me to work on an alternative, and I'm delighted today to second this motion, which I think does exactly what my community have asked.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In April this year, 340 members of Rural Australians for Refugees gathered in Wodonga in my electorate. At their conference, they called on the Australian government to come up with a policy on people seeking Australian protection, which this bill does. Rural Australians for Refugees have a very clear message for this parliament. They say that rural Australians care and that they have ideas, and that we have solutions, we can do better, we should do better and we are better. They also say that Rural Australians for Refugees are willing partners in finding the solutions. I'm delighted to welcome today to the parliament my guest, the president of Rural Australians for Refugees, Marie Sellstrom. Thank you for your work and that of my constituents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of parliament, this has the support of Australia. This has the support of rural Australia. It's a really important piece of legislation that actually creates an alternative and breaks the impasse that we have been experiencing. It brings to parliament, through me and the member for Denison, the support of our communities. We're now calling on the Australian people to do exactly what the member for Denison said.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today to support the motion moved by the member for Franklin, and I join her in condemning the government for the aged-care crisis that it has created on its watch. Older Australians are languishing in limbo, waiting for approved home care packages—packages which should be assessed according to their needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The figures are disturbing as to what they reveal. Almost 300 older Australians have waited for more than two years for their approved package. A further 636 older Australians have waited for more than one year for care. More than 100,000 older Australians are waiting for the packages that they have been approved for, even if their needs are greater. The last package of data revealed that almost 105,000 older Australians were waiting for a home care package, with the average wait time for a high-level package blowing out to more than a year. The situation may be worse than this, but the minister's department has delayed releasing important data on the numbers waiting for home care packages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each person waiting for a home care package is a person who is not able to receive the support they need or deserve. Not only are thousands left without desperately needed care; they and their families are placed under pressure trying to ensure that their loved ones have acceptable care, whilst simultaneously attempting to navigate a complicated, dysfunctional system. There are other flow-on effects as a result of this crisis. Older Australians who should have otherwise had access to a home care package are instead forced to visit emergency rooms in our public hospitals, having a real impact upon health departments and budgets at a state level. There is also the potential for overburdening residential care with residents that should and could be otherwise managed at home with a home care package under policies which are designed to ensure that people stay longer at home in familiar environments, close to loved ones and with the care that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen in the recent federal budget the government's purported response to the home care crisis. Indeed, whilst heralding a very good budget for health, and for aged care in particular, the Minister for Health and this minister, the Minister for Aged Care, have both misrepresented this government's commitment to solving the aged-care crisis. That commitment is illusory and inadequate. Their commitment of 14,000 home care packages is woefully inadequate in the face of the thousands waiting for approved packages and thousands more on waiting lists. Indeed, this is nothing but a cruel hoax for older Australians—slashing residential care to try and fix the home care crisis whilst making a mess of both residential care and home care packages. This Liberal government is robbing Peter to pay Paul, and it won't even come close to meeting the demand for home care, when the waiting list grew by 20,000 in the last six months of 2017 alone. The situation can and will get worse without further attention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians who need home care assistance will be forced to look at residential care if they are unable to look after themselves in their home environment. But they will find, because of this government's refusal to provide additional real funding, that residential care will be difficult to find. We are faced with the real prospect of an emerging generation of elderly people who want to remain at home, safe in a familiar environment, but are unable to safely enjoy that home environment without a home care package. There are real risks of accidents, including dangerous falls, and a risk that domestic activities that should be possible with a small amount of home care assistance will be more difficult, leading to greater stress and anxiety—stress and anxiety which should be avoided by providing funding for more home care packages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I indicated earlier that the system is chronically underfunded, complex and dysfunctional. One constituent of mine despairs at the state of the My Aged Care website, saying that it should be a research tool for older Australians, not an advertising platform for providers. In fact, this constituent pointed out to me that, despite the fact that she lives in a seaside village in north-east Tasmania and finally received an aged-care package after an extended wait, the My Aged Care website reports that she has in excess of 80 service providers available to her, people that purportedly may provide home care services to her—more service providers than are available to a potential consumer in Hobart or indeed Canberra. The reality, however, is that there are few providers available to her, despite what the My Aged Care website reports. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3A" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WYATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Indigenous Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  I thank the member for Grayndler for seconding the motion. Every year, the coalition government's aged-care funding is up. Home care packages are up and residential places are up. Under Labor's Living Longer Living Better reforms, the ratios set for the release of home care packages were inadequate and severely underestimated the real demand. It's always interesting, when you look at a population pyramid, to look at where the pressure points are within that pyramid. Certainly if Labor had done their work once the Living Longer Living Better legislation had been brought in then we wouldn't have the mess that they've left.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not a system of dysfunction, as those on the other side continually claim. Our reforms uncovered the extent of the problem left by the former Labor government, which the Turnbull government is working to fix. We inherited a home care system with ratios that were absolutely inadequate and a supply of packages that was vastly insufficient for real demand. Instead of investing in care for our older Australians, Labor ripped money out of aged care to prop up their budget bottom line. In 2010-11, a Labor government ripped $9 million from residential aged care and failed to reinvest every dollar—a $9 million cut, and the source is the budget papers. In 2011-12, Labor ripped over $200 million out of residential aged care, and, in 2012-13, there was another cut of $135 million. But what's not reflected is the amount that was handed back to consolidated revenue because the packages weren't taken up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike Labor, this government is making record investments in aged cared, delivering around $5 billion in funding boosts in the forward years. When I look back on the establishment of the Living Longer Living Better legislation, there was bipartisan support but insufficient planning for the level of resourcing needed to meet the needs of older Australians. In delivering better access to care, home care packages will rise from 87,000 to 151,000 with the rollout of an additional 14,000 high-level packages—real packages, real money. There will be $40 million to support aged-care providers in regional, rural and remote Australia for building and maintenance works—real money. There will be $105 million to improve access to culturally safe aged-care services in remote Indigenous communities. There will be 14,000 residential beds and short-term restorative care places made available, and that process is rolling out. Plus, there will be a $60 million capital investment to improve the facilities and provide the infrastructure required. And there will be investment in an additional viability supplement for regional and remote providers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second tranche is delivering better quality of care. There will be a new Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. There will be $32.6 million for intensified risk profiling and compliance management to reduce the impact on senior Australians within aged care. There will be $50 million for residential aged-care providers to transition to the new quality standards. With Better Ageing, we're providing over $100 million to enhance mental health services for older Australians. There will be $22.9 million in grant programs to encourage increased physical activity in older Australians to enable their bodies to be mobile and resilient, have good muscle tone and also have musculoskeletal support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When people talk about the list, they forget that it is a range of packages. Previously, people applying for a place within residential care would list their names with a number of providers. That has been the history in the provision of packages and places. Often, people didn't hear back. What we provide is an increase in the number of places that senior Australians will access, but they're supported by the Commonwealth Home Support Program—1.3 million Australians. On that list of 104,000, 51 per cent are in receipt of a range of services that wrap around and meet their needs. What we're not going to do is sit and wait and listen to the criticisms that come from the other side. The $5.5 billion allocated over the forward years is real money for programs that are designed to keep Australians healthy in the first instance and to provide the packages of choice so that people can either live within their home or in a residential aged-care facility—or some have moved into retirement villages, where they live out their years enjoying both the support of the packages and the services that are needed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  The hoax perpetrated on older Australians by the Turnbull government in this year's budget is shameful. The 14,000 additional home care packages over three years announced in the budget does not come close to meeting the growing demand. What's worse is that the money taken to fund these home care packages has come from residential care funding as there is no more money in the budget for aged care—not a single dollar. We have over 100,000 older Australians waiting for home care. We have a waiting list that grew by 20,000 in six months. And what was the government's response? It was 14,000 packages to be released over three years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was first touched by this as a young pharmacist, when I visited a psychiatric aged-care facility. I walked in, was struck by the misery and had to walk out and walk back in again. Improvements have been made in my 20 years working with residential aged care as a pharmacist, but much more needs to be done. How does the Turnbull government think these families are going to manage while they wait—in some cases for a year and, in 300 cases, more than two years—for the support they urgently need? This leaves vulnerable people at risk. These are people like my late father, who lived with young onset dementia. He was at risk of falls, at risk of poor nutrition, at risk of missed medication—and, as a pharmacist, that particularly bothers me—at risk of missed medical appointments and at risk of loneliness and isolation. These risks are avoidable; if only the government would help families as they juggle the needs of their partner, mother, father, brother, sister or friend while trying to keep up with work or study or family or to just get by.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are those older Australians who have no support at all, and there are many in our community on the Central Coast. On the Central Coast of New South Wales, we are an older population. One in five of us is aged over 65 and one in six of us, or 19,000 people, are employed in health care and social assistance. It's the biggest employer on the coast. It's where I worked for 10 years as a pharmacist in Wyong Hospital. Aged care matters on the Central Coast. I have previously told this House that on the Central Coast we have 750 people waiting for home care packages. That's people and families in urgent need and waiting right now. About two-thirds of those waiting have high needs. Many are living with dementia. Many need palliative care. Older people, people with high needs, people with dementia and their families cannot wait a year or two or more for the help that they need. They need it right now. Where is the urgency from the minister to address this crisis in communities?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I spoke at a forum on the Central Coast organised by the Health Services Union, my union, called 'Our Turn To Care'. About 100 people rallied at the Central Coast Leagues Club to call for proper funding for aged-care services and better pay and conditions for the aged-care workers who care for them. We heard stories from aged-care workers that were just shocking—for example, that they had been told to wait until a person's incontinence pad was 70 per cent wet before it could be changed; that they were only allowed one pair of gloves per shift because a second pair would be too costly; and that the money spent on food per person per day in an aged-care facility is sometimes just $6.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later in the week I attended an event at the Erina shopping centre called 'Celebrating Ageing Central Coast—valuing your wisdom, experience and knowledge' with the member for Robertson, Lucy Wicks, who is in the chamber. It was organised by the NSW Elder Abuse Helpline &amp; Resource Unit to celebrate ageing but also to put a spotlight on the important issue of elder abuse. I have seen the most severe forms of elder abuse while working in mental health inpatient units. The World Health Organization reports that one in 10 older people experience elder abuse and most of it is perpetrated by family members. Elder abuse is real and, sadly, it happens in our communities. Sometimes it's obvious—a grandparent being pushed into residential care so their family home can be sold—and sometimes it is invisible to others until a bank account dwindles and there's no money left to buy food or pay the electricity bill. As I mentioned, as a pharmacist at Wyong Hospital, I worked in the inpatient mental health units for 10 years and saw the most severe forms of elder abuse against older people living with major mental illness and against the parents of adult children with major mental illness. There are legal protections in place but we must do more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Older Australians deserve quality care, dignity and respect. They are our mums and our dads. They are our grandmas and our grandpas. The Turnbull government must fix the home care crisis now. It is urgent. Older Australians and their families can't wait any longer. The government must come clean with the Australian people on the hoax it has perpetrated. There is no new money for aged care in this budget. Money for home care will come from residential care and services will inevitably be cut. The Turnbull government stands condemned for the aged-care crisis of its making. It must act now. It must act with urgency. It must act with compassion. It has to help people in need now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak very briefly on this most important issue that the member for Franklin has raised, but I will not be supporting the motion, because the reality is that this government is delivering a record investment in aged care, supporting older Australians with more choice and delivering better access to quality care, particularly in my electorate of Robertson on the New South Wales Central Coast, where we have a growing ageing population and where aged care is absolutely a priority for this government. Our record on this issue speaks for itself. Since the election of the coalition government, aged-care spending has increased by an average of more than six per cent each year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our 2018-19 budget, which was handed down last month, outlined our plan for a stronger economy and it outlined our plan to ensure that older Australians are supported. For the more than 30,000 older Australians in my electorate of Robertson on the New South Wales Central Coast, we have outlined a strong plan to be able to deliver real support for the older Australians who have given so much to our community and to our nation and who have really helped over their lifetimes, individually and as a group, to help make the Central Coast the very best region in the very best country in the world. We outlined that we're delivering an additional 20,000 home care packages, 13,500 residential places and the largest ever single increase to mental health funding for older Australians. Under the coalition's comprehensive and fully-funded aged-care plan, the number of high-level home care packages will actually rise by 86 per cent to 74,000 over the next five years. Over the last couple of weeks I have been visiting a number of places around the Central Coast and speaking with senior Australians and aged-care service providers. I have heard very comprehensively how these increases, and what we are doing to help our senior Australians, are very much welcomed on the Central Coast. For the more than 30,000 older Australians in my electorate of Robertson on the New South Wales Central Coast, we have outlined our plan and we are delivering real support for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Franklin spoke about the wait times for aged-care packages. But let's not forget that under Labor the waiting list was actually hidden from public view. Under Labor, we didn't even know how many older Australians were on the waiting list. In February 2017, it was actually this government that introduced measures to help make the list more transparent and totally visible for the first time. In relation to older Australians who are waiting in the queue, almost half are already receiving interim care, which is good; and a majority of older Australians on this list receive support services through our record investment in the Commonwealth Home Support Program, which includes vital services such as Meals on Wheels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I wish to underline an important fact: this government is focused on guaranteeing the essential services for older Australians to ensure they have more choice—whether that be in aged care, in staying home longer or in having access to the support they need.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  I rise today to put on record my comments in relation to the member for Franklin's motion. I've said it here before and I'll say it again: we cannot trust the Turnbull government to deliver a pizza, let alone meaningful action for the more than 100,000 older Australians who are waiting for home care packages. You only have to look at this out-of-touch government's budget handed down last month to see that those opposite will never truly understand how to put the best interests of older Australians front and centre. Axing the energy supplement and making Australians work until they're 70 are a couple of the things on their hit list. This government has not allocated a single extra dollar for Australia's aged-care system in this year's budget. More than 14,000 age pensioners live in my electorate of Lindsay, and they deserve better than what this government is serving up. It is an absolute disgrace that the average wait time for high-level home-care packages will soar this year. It is an absolute disgrace that this government wants to take $550 a year from pensioners through their energy supplements. The Turnbull government has legislation coming through that will see older Australians having to work until they are 70 before they can get the age pension. It is an absolute disgrace that this government wants to take $1.3 billion from pensioners through concessions that help them with important things like dealing with the continuously rising costs of living—that will be going—while it gives $80 billion in corporate tax breaks to those who need it least.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is waging a war on older Australians. The shambles in access to aged-care home packages is symptomatic of this government's out-of-touch and problematic approach to our most vulnerable Australians. This government thinks that 3½ thousand places a year to deal with the increasing demand is enough. The government thinks that funding just 14,000 aged-care packages is enough to deal with a backlog that has already climbed to 200,000 in just six months. We are facing an aged-care crisis, and the Turnbull government can no longer ignore the problem by looking the other way. Older Australians deserve to be cared for and invested in. We need to do everything we can to ensure they are supported in the later years of their lives. Older Australians are some of the most vulnerable members of our communities and they cannot afford this government's inaction on the matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the Minister for Aged Care to release the latest round of data on the wait list for home care packages and to be honest with us all and what we are really dealing with. We have already waited a fortnight, and older Australians have already waited that time as well. Frankly, we are sick of waiting. The government needs to be held to account and answer why there have been billions of dollars in funding cuts to the aged-care instrument and funding cuts to residential aged care. The government needs to be held to account for its blatant dishonesty by claiming to champion aged care and then turning around and defunding it. Not only did the government's budget not add up and underdeliver but it was also extremely dishonest and underhanded. The aged-care minister couldn't even guarantee older Australians that their circumstances would improve or that their voices are heard, stating:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It'll be the status quo for a short period of time and then we'll start to look at a range of other interventions that will reduce that list.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask him: when will that occur? The aged-care minister has simply resigned both himself and older Australians who are depending on home care packages to accept the status quo and vague promises of interventions, which the government has refused to outline thus far. The Turnbull-Abbott government, or the Turnbull government, or whoever is running the show on the other side these days, has slashed and has continued to cut billions of dollars from aged care and is responsible for the growing waiting lists for in-home care. How can this government justify funding $80 billion in tax cuts for the big end of town, including $17 billion for the big-bank fat cats, while stripping funding away from some of our most vulnerable Australians?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The aged-care budget—and we've analysed it—will hurt older Australians. The government has created the aged-care crisis, has continued to ignore the aged-care crisis and is putting our oldest Australians at risk. If the government fails to act, we will see not only the material impact on older Australians but also the mental impact on older Australians from the stress and anxiety that the government created with its failure to fix the crisis of its own making. The government has a proven track record of cutting funding and underinvesting in aged care. Only a Labor government will fight to make sure that older Australians get their fair share. Labor will give older Australians a fair go and will make sure they are supported and looked after in their later years. The Turnbull government needs to act and act now. It can no longer stick its head in the sand and ignore the aged-care crisis of their own making.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  There is nothing more concrete than the fact that each one of us adds a birthday number on the anniversary of our arrival on this planet. The recent issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">50</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Something</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>quoted a point articulated by the Aged Care Workforce Strategy Taskforce: 'How we care for our ageing is a reflection of who we are as a nation.' Ageing is changing. Our attitudes to growing older are more about doing it gracefully with friends, with activities and with good-quality support, not just having a system of putting people in an institution and making sure they're comfortable. Aged care in our regions has always been a bit of a problem and we'll be addressing that. I wonder sometimes if some speakers have been to an aged-care facility, because the problems that exist now didn't happen overnight; they've been developing for years and years and years, and we are addressing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're putting in an extra 14,000 new home care packages. Our funding is growing from $18 billion in 2017-18 to $23 billion in 2021-22. That's an additional $86 billion—not less, not reduced but additional. We're delivering an additional 20,000 high-level home care packages—that's in total—plus 13,500 residential places. That is the largest ever single increase to mental health funding for older Australians, which, as we all know, is becoming a much more significant problem. Over the next four years, aged-care funding is up, the number of home care packages is up and the number of residential aged-care places is up, particularly in regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My concern has been about how we get the priority listing for people to get into an aged-care place. The aged-care approval round announced recently by the Deputy Prime Minister, Michael McCormack, and our aged-care minister, Ken Wyatt, was really welcome. They're going to get those places and will get an additional 775 respite places. There's an additional $5 billion budget boost for aged care. We'll be getting applications for this special process after 2 July. That is fantastic news for the regions and will help to accelerate the process. We absolutely need to have everybody included in this process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my aged-care facilities recently said that part of the problem for them is that the assessment sometimes needs to be done online, so we need a process—and some of my aged-care providers are already doing this—to assist clients to go online, go through the process and help them work out what their aged-care level and needs are. In the beginning some people might say, 'I can do that,' but in fact it is somebody else who helps them get dressed or prepares their Meals on Wheels food. They need a level of care that's a little higher. But, because we're Aussies, we like to be independent. We don't always say, 'I need this, this and this'. We like to be independent. Our scheme is to try and keep them as independent as possible but make sure we're addressing the fact that there are hidden needs—needs that have been hidden because we've been so strong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past we had 'Mediscare', then 'wages scare', and now we're getting 'bed-care scare'. In Labor's 2010 budget, they ripped $9 million out of aged care and booked the savings. In the 2011-12 budget, they ripped another $211.7 million out of aged care. In 2012-13, Labor cut residential care places. We are now seeing the outcome of all those cuts. We're putting a significant amount of money into long-term reforms and a costed plan to support older Australians. It's costed and funded. It's going through the budget. Thanks to this boost, we're going to have an 86 per cent increase over five years. Some will say there are waiting lists and queues. That's not surprising when we're developing a world-class care system for an increasing demographic sector. Almost half of those in the queue are already receiving interim care. Offering them high-level packages through the release of additional high-level packages will free up their existing package for somebody else.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COLLINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  It's great to be able to speak to this motion, because I've been talking in this place for some time about how the government has mishandled aged care in this country. We are seeing a crisis in aged care on this government's watch. To have the minister come in here this morning, after five years in government, three ministers and billions of dollars ripped out of aged care, trying to blame the Labor Party, when we haven't been in government for five years, is astounding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were 100,000 people waiting for home care as at the end of December. I am sure that there are many more, but the government hasn't released the figures to the end of March. Those figures are now well overdue. In estimates we heard that the department thinks they may be with the minister's office. When was estimates? It was at least three weeks ago. I wonder why these figures have been delayed and what they look like? We know that 20,000 people were added to that waiting list in the last six months of last year. The question for the government today is: what is the current figure? How many older Australians are today waiting for care in their own home? We don't know the answer, because several months on from December the government has yet to release the figures. Why hasn't the government released the figures? What is it hiding? How many people is it trying to move off that list? That's exactly what I think's going on here: the minister's office and the minister are sitting there trying to knock off the list people who have been waiting for care and who should be on the list.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the government's own admission that it hadn't done enough in the last budget. We had the government try and pretend that it's got 20,000 new packages and then have to admit it's only 14,000, including the other 6,000 it made available late last year in October. We know that 14,000 over four years isn't going to make a dent. This government came in here on budget night and pretended that it had done something amazing in aged care, but we saw not one extra dollar over the forwards than was already in the budget. Not one extra dollar is being spent in aged care, when we have over 100,000 older Australians waiting for home care in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a disgrace, and the government should be ashamed that it's out there trying to pull the wool over the eyes of older Australians, pretending that it's done something when it has not. It is not okay to try and pretend to older Australians and their families, who are very stressed, looking for support for their older parents. These families are ringing my office and other offices every day, saying, 'When can I get a home care package for my mum or my dad?' They are desperate. For the government to pretend that it is doing something is just appalling. It is appalling and it is a cruel hoax on older Australians, their families and their loved ones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the February estimates we saw that there are around 300 people on the waiting list who have been waiting for longer than two years—two years with no care, waiting for a home care package! We have people ringing up my office nearly every week who have been on that list for over a year. The government's own website says the current wait time for a level 3 or 4 package is over 12 months. We're not sure what 'over 12 months' means—how long over—but we know people who have been waiting considerable time frames. When you're getting people in their 90s contacting you to say, 'The government's put me on a waiting list, and I have to wait at least 12 months,' that is not good enough. We all know what's going to happen to those older people, particularly those in their 90s, who are at home, waiting for care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What happens? You have family members who have to pick up that care. They have to come home from work early or not go to work. We've had older people turning up in emergency rooms well before they should because they could not get the care at home. It's having an effect on hospital wait times in emergency departments and it's having an effect on ambulance call-outs. These old people should be receiving the care in their home that they deserve and have been assessed and approved for, but this government will not fund their packages. Over 100,000 older Australians are today still waiting for their package, despite the budget and despite what this government says. It's about time this government did something about it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  The Australian Labor Party is morally bankrupt. Those opposite are morally bankrupt. The strategy that they have clearly employed is twofold when it comes to older Australians. No. 1: they lie; No. 2, they tax them. Lie and tax, lie and tax, lie and tax—that's Labor's strategy. I think the two pillars of this strategy go hand in hand, because the trick of the Labor Party is to create crises that don't exist. It's the old look-over-here strategy: generate such concern, such anxiety, in older Australians and put their focus elsewhere, on a problem that does not exist, so that the Labor Party can pick their pockets with higher taxes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, this is precisely what we are seeing with the Shorten-led opposition, and it is a disgrace. We saw it last federal election with the 'Mediscare' campaign, which those opposite have laughed at every time it's been mentioned in this House because they know it was based on a lie. I put to them: how many older Australians bought into that lie? How many older Australians with heart problems, age problems and loneliness sat in their living rooms and believed Labor's lies? How many of them felt as though they were under threat? How many people in the seat of Longman, up in Queensland, are believing the outright lies of the Labor Party about less federal government funding for hospitals? It's an outright lie; the facts tell the opposite story. How many people are tuned in to this debate? How many older Australians are listening yet again to Labor's lies and being affected by them?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They do this unashamedly. They enter this House and they communicate to the public and they generate fear and anxiety among older Australians based on nothing—lies and tax. If we look at the facts, in 2010-11 $9 million was cut from aged care under the Labor Party. The next year, 2011-12, the Labor Party cut $200 million from aged care—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, those lies and those taxes that are the focus of the Labor Party are in direct contrast with the performance of the Turnbull government, where home care packages are up, residential places are up and every year funding for aged care is up. Since the coalition government was elected, aged-care spending has increased by an average of more than six per cent each year. That is, on average, $1 billion of extra support for older Australians each year. More than 1.3 million older Australians are accessing some form of support in the Commonwealth aged-care sector. The Turnbull government is providing record aged-care funding of $19.8 billion in 2018-19. Did the Labor Party ever provide such funding in government? The heads opposite are down, Deputy Speaker, because the facts tell the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government respects the dignity and is responding to the needs of older Australians. There is not a crisis. Older Australians need not be suffering anxiety from the fear that the Labor Party is trying to engender. Funding to aged care continues to grow with this government, with ongoing investment. It's for that reason that I'm very happy to reject their lies and their taxes and support the federal government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, and the Turnbull government. Both are determined to do more to support endometriosis sufferers around Australia. This chronic disease has been historically under-recognised amongst both the medical fraternity and the general public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why does endometriosis matter so much? It matters because at least 700,000 women and girls in Australia are living with this disease today. Some research indicates that it is more common than breast and prostate cancer and diabetes. Around the world, approximately 176 million women and girls are suffering from endo. Endometriosis is a chronic, progressive disease, usually resulting in severe, debilitating chronic pain and often leading to infertility. It significantly impacts on the social and economic participation and the psychosocial health of those women affected. It is taking at least seven to 10 years to diagnose. At the moment, there is no cure for endometriosis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, for his commitment to the women and girls suffering from endometriosis. He has led the way in his ministerial portfolio. He commissioned the first ever Australian national endometriosis plan, which is focused on three priority areas to help improve the lives of Australian women and girls who live with endo. The priority areas of the plan are public awareness and education, clinical management and care and research.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clinical management and care is so important to patients who need access to individual information and support and to services that are right for them and their circumstances; services that are available and accessible. So committed is Minister Hunt that earlier this year he announced $2.5 million from the Medical Research Future Fund for Australia's world-class researchers to develop improved diagnosis and treatment options directly aimed at improving patient outcomes for endo sufferers. In this year's budget, the Turnbull government committed a further $1 million to actually increase the awareness and understanding of endometriosis amongst general practitioners and other frontline health professionals—the actual coalface. This is where, early in the process, young women's symptoms need to be taken seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all those who have helped draft the first endo plan: the endo patient advocates, the Australian Coalition for Endometriosis, the researchers, the clinicians, the patients themselves and the members of parliament who were part of it. Equally, I want to thank everyone who has contributed to the plan during the consultation process and those very courageous women who have sent me their personal stories. Even the dads and mums who talk to me constantly about their daughters' battles with endo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank my daughter, Kylie, for allowing me to share her endometriosis story. It was not easy to do for her, or for me. But what both Kylie and I want to do is to warn every other young woman to take the symptoms seriously. Please persist until you get a GP and a gynaecologist who will take you seriously. While it is too late for Kylie, it is not too late for thousands of young women in Australia and around the world. It took Kylie nearly 20 years to get that diagnosis, and what she suffered during that time is what thousands of women around Australia are suffering right now and have suffered for so many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's groundbreaking national endo plan is due for release in July. As an Endometriosis Australia ambassador, I am very proud of this, and I thank Minister Hunt for taking me seriously when I knocked on his door and talked about how serious this issue is. I'm very, very proud of it and I thank Minister Hunt on behalf of every woman who now actually has more hope: more hope for an earlier diagnosis, more hope for better care and management, and for a better quality of life as a result—and not the drastic outcome that I see in my daughter and so many other women around this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I actually look forward to the day when our amazing researchers announce that they've found a cure. That's what I'm relying on from you as researchers—that you will come up with the cure. But, ultimately, I'll go back to where I started long ago in this. I want to warn all young women to take their symptoms seriously—please!—and I urge every single GP and gynaecologist to do exactly the same. Take these women seriously, please.</span>

I want to thank the member for Forrest for this motion and for her years and years of fighting to have endometriosis recognised by the leaders of our nation. And I want to thank her daughter, Kylie, for her courage. I want to thank the member for Boothby for reaching across the aisle to join with the member for Forrest and me in establishing the Parliamentary Friends of Endometriosis Awareness, which we launched last December. I want to thank the journalists and the media outlets that have been reporting on this issue in the past 18 months. I want to thank Esther Han and <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>, Gabrielle Jackson and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span>, and the Huffington Post. I want to thank the Yellow Wiggle, Emma Watkins, for talking with the nation about her battle with endo.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, out of the hundreds of thousands of endo sufferers in Australia, I want to thank the hundreds who have bravely and candidly shared their stories of living with endometriosis, and I want to thank their fabulous families and friends for their support. They have shared their stories of being seen as 'the sick person in the office' when they are normally fit women. They shared stories of losing their self-confidence and self-esteem because of not being taken seriously by the medical profession, of being told to go home and have sex to burst a cyst, of being told to suck it up because period pain is difficult and painful and you just have to get on with it, that this is 'part of being a woman'. They shared stories of lost educational opportunities because they needed to have so much time off school or TAFE or university. They shared stories of not being able to socialise like any normal 20-something and go out for a drink or a dinner or a movie because they were too exhausted or too broke or in too much pain. They shared stories of the lack of understanding and discrimination in the workforce and in the medical profession, of the horror of seeing the scars on their beautiful young bodies for the first time after their first operations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were stories of the incredible financial burden of endometriosis: the cost of drugs, the cost of specialists, the cost of operations. And there were stories of not being able to work full time, or even part time, because of the endless interventions and the recovery time required after them. They shared stories of having to live at home in their 20s, when their peers were moving into share accommodation or were saving for their first home, because they were not working or they were working part time or they were working sporadically and so they couldn't sustain rent let alone savings. There were stories of hysterectomies too young, of hysterectomies in their 20s, of multiple radical operations by their mid-20s, of battles with infertility. And there were stories of mental health challenges, of depression, of anxiety, of anguish due to constant pain and constant bleeding and constant financial stress and the deeply confronting operations and—to put it in the words of an endo sufferer here in Canberra—'The horrifying realisation at a young age that they will never ever, ever, ever reach their potential.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to the efforts of so many over so many years we now have investment in research, as the member for Forrest has highlighted. We now have investment in awareness, particularly targeted at GPs and the medical profession. We now have a draft national action plan that is being finalised after months of consultation. I, too, want to thank all the endo sufferers, the endo warriors, the endo activists, the medical professionals, the members of parliament and others who were involved in that national consultation process and involved in that draft national action plan.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we now have the leaders of our nation talking about endometriosis, about the one in 10. I want to thank the Minister for Health for his apology last year which acknowledged these women had been ignored for too long. Finally, these women who had been so, so frightened, so, so voiceless and so, so powerless are now not on their own. At last, we have begun the conversation on endometriosis and the one in 10. We now have to make that conversation louder. We now have to make that conversation broader. We now have to have that conversation every day and end the silence on endo. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:28</span>):  Much more remains to be done to raise awareness on endometriosis and to find better treatments and, hopefully, even a cure for this awful disease. This parliament has made a very strong start in finally recognising and addressing this devastating condition. In June last year, the member for Canberra—I'm glad she is in the chamber—and I started the Parliamentary Friends of Endometriosis Awareness. We brought together the hardworking and dedicated advocacy groups—EndoActive, Pelvic Pain Foundation, Endometriosis Australia, the Canberra endometriosis support group and QENDO in early September. These wonderful volunteers worked together to identify their key priorities for action on endo. The member for Canberra and I presented the priorities to the shadow minister for health and the Minister for Health. Our quest for action was supported by our colleague the member for Forrest in many ways, but most powerfully by her sharing with parliament and the Minister for Health her personal story of the truly awful impact endometriosis has had on her daughter, Kylie, and the member for Forrest's family. I want to thank the member for Forrest for her tireless advocacy and support, and for moving this motion today so that we can keep endo front of mind for everybody but, most importantly, for women and health professionals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are making sure that women no longer suffer in silence and we are acknowledging their pain. That is precisely what the minister for health did late last year when he apologised to women who have suffered from endometriosis, announced funding for endo expert Dr Grant Montgomery and announced that the first-ever National Action Plan for Endometriosis would be developed. In February this year in Melbourne, my colleagues and I joined advocacy groups, health professionals, the Jean Hailes foundation and others to further identify the key actions that should be taken on endo. Extensive public consultation has also been undertaken, and I look forward to the launch of the plan in July. The plan will focus on awareness and education, treatment and research.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister for health has also announced a $1 million investment in the May budget to be put towards awareness of and education on endometriosis among the medical and health professions. This means that health practitioners will have increased access to resources and training and will better understand appropriate treatment pathways. The minister for health has also announced that $2½ million from the Medical Research Future Fund will be used to accelerate research translation in the medical research priority areas identified in the National Action Plan for Endometriosis. The minister has further announced that endometriosis will be a feature of this year's Women's Health Week, from 3 to 7 September 2018, which will raise the profile of endometriosis with women around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Awareness and education remain a critical part of our approach to endometriosis. I am determined to ensure that women and doctors understand what endo is and the signs and symptoms of this terrible disease. Endometriosis causes the cells that line the uterus to grow as lesions in other parts of the body and within the pelvis, causing inflammation, severe pain and scar tissue. These lesions can stick organs together, so that women have to have parts of their bowel removed, their ovaries removed, surgery to their bladder and even full hysterectomies. They may have terrible trouble starting a family and have to undergo IVF to do so. When I talk about the pain of endo, I mean pain that is so severe that women can't get out of bed to go to school or to university or to work. This might be pain during their period, but, due to the severe nature of the pain and the condition, pain can be present constantly. When pain is so regular that it becomes chronic pain, it's far more complicated to treat. Women delay, for years, consulting a doctor for their condition—in part, because we fail to educate women as to what levels of period pain are normal and what levels of period pain are not normal and need medical investigation. When women do consult a doctor, there's an average delay of eight years before they are diagnosed with endometriosis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have started a conversation, and we must ensure that it continues, in homes, in schools, in medical practices, in hospitals and in the workplace. We have seen people like US actress Lena Dunham, Yellow Wiggle Emma Watkins and radio personality Mel Greig bravely come forward to publicly share their very personal stories and to help end the silence on endometriosis. I was similarly delighted to learn that students at Mercedes College, one of the local high schools in my electorate, recently hosted a presentation with the Pelvic Pain Foundation to raise awareness among their peers about the condition. We, here in parliament, are doing everything we can as well to work for the policy change we know that these women need, and for our future generations of young women.</span>

I congratulate the member for Canberra, Gai Brodtmann, the member for Forrest, Nola Marino, and the member for Boothby, Nicolle Flint, for their hard work on shining a light on a disease which has caused millions of women to suffer in silence. Without their advocacy, I'm pretty sure we would not have the first National Action Plan for Endometriosis. However, I find it horrendous that a disease as debilitating as endometriosis requires parliamentarians to demand that the medical community believe the women who present with these symptoms and treat them with respect and dignity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Endometriosis has been, historically, underrecognised by doctors, and has never been properly prioritised as worthy of research or effective management, and, consequently, has been underdiagnosed and poorly treated, causing much pain and anguish for so many women. There are around the same number of diabetes and asthma sufferers as there are endometriosis sufferers. Yet, in 2016, the National Health and Medical Research Council allocated more than $14 million to asthma research, $64 million to diabetes research and less than $900,000 to endometriosis research, which is why I believe it's important to acknowledge that endometriosis is a gendered disease. It's a women's disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For far too long, women with endometriosis have had their symptoms and pain delegitimised by the medical profession. Too often they are told, 'You're just being hysterical,' or that they are hypochondriacs, that the pain will soon settle down, that all women get period pain, that it can't be that bad or, as my young friend Rachel, who suffers badly with this condition, is constantly told by doctors, family and friends, 'Just have a baby; that'll fix it.' Let's be clear: having a baby is not a medical treatment. Rachel is a young, professional woman. She has her own life's plan—a plan that has been hampered by a debilitating condition. Telling a young woman to just have a baby borders on contempt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Endometriosis causes excruciating pain and can lead to infertility. We've heard through the media of Jessica Panetta, a young woman who suffers from endometriosis and recently described the pain as 'like barbed wires are being pulled through my ribs'. Instances of the medical professional not taking women's pain seriously aren't just anecdotal; they are backed up by evidence. The University of Pennsylvania found that women are less likely to receive pain medication in emergency centres than men, and, when they do get it, they have to wait longer for it. Why is it that we treat men's pain quickly and effectively, yet when women tell us they're in pain we tell them to calm down? The cruel irony of endometriosis is that early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. The average wait time, as we've heard in this chamber this morning, is seven to 10 years. While one in 10 women in Australia wait for diagnosis and treatments, the excruciating pain of endometriosis can take over. Women miss work and school. Their relationships can suffer. They suffer through missed diagnoses and operations. They can even lose complete control of their lives and any plan that they might've had for their future. And they can often lose hope; that is the greatest loss of all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But women around Australia are saying, 'Enough is enough'. They are angry about the years of inaction, and fantastic women like the members for Forrest, Boothby and Canberra have listened. They have heard and they are taking much-needed action. This is what we are in this House for: to make legislative changes that make people's lives better, that give them hope, that clear the way for a future. Endometriosis tells us that while we prioritise men's lives and bodies over those of our women many will continue to suffer through pain and medical inaction. As a registered nurse and a woman, I have personally seen and experienced the indignity of being told—and heard talk of—that female conditions are just 'women's problems'. I am pleased to support a motion that, for endometriosis sufferers, means that change is indeed ahead.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  I commend the member for Forrest for providing an opportunity to speak about endometriosis in the House today. I also want to acknowledge the work of the co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of Endometriosis Awareness, the members for Canberra and Boothby.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the first time I've spoken in the House since a period of parental leave, and I'd like to thank the House for giving me some time to be with my wife and son. It's particularly appropriate that I speak on this motion as the first motion since coming back, because I speak today as the husband of a woman who has endometriosis. I want to say something to the women who suffer from endometriosis on behalf of their husbands and partners: to the women in our lives going through the pain of endometriosis, know that we love you, we support you and, indeed, we think you're amazing. I've seen firsthand the pain endometriosis can cause and I've watched my wife endure that pain and multiple surgeries. I know the effect that endometriosis can have on fertility; I know how important it is to have correct diagnosis and specialty care; and I know that other sufferers of endometriosis have had it worse than even Joanna and I. My message to women experiencing period pain is: don't suffer in silence. Get it checked, ask about endometriosis, and ask and ask again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Endometriosis is a debilitating condition that affects around one in 10 Australian women, in which the endometrium—the tissue that normally covers the inside of the uterus—grows outside and around the uterus, on other reproductive organs, the ovaries and fallopian tubes and, in extreme cases, other parts of the body. The symptoms that endo patients experience vastly differ in variety and intensity from woman to woman. According to research, 60 to 80 per cent of endo patients suffer with period pain, and 40 to 50 per cent experience chronic pelvic pain and intense dyspareunia. In 30 to 50 per cent of cases, patients suffer infertility. Twenty per cent of endometriosis patients present no symptoms at all. Endometriosis symptoms can be horribly unpleasant, but currently researchers are unclear about what causes endometriosis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Endometriosis affects five per cent of our population, but it has received little to no attention in the media and is rarely ever featured in public discourse. As a result, there are many misconceptions about the condition in the community. This lack of awareness and understanding is prevalent among both men and women. There are far too many Australian girls and women who have suffered too silently with endo, believing their severe period pain is normal or just part of being a woman. It's particularly a problem in some ethnic communities where women's health issues remain taboo. Better endo awareness through the community means that sufferers and their families can recognise the symptoms and seek help immediately. This includes building better support networks so that diagnosed patients know they are not alone in their experiences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've heard from others, there is an average 10-year delay between when sufferers of endo first develop the condition and when they receive a correct diagnosis from a medical professional. That's 10 years of suffering without answers or the correct treatment. While endo is a difficult condition to diagnose, the problem is primarily caused by a blind spot among some medical practitioners. The stories many courageous women have shared about recurring incorrect diagnoses are deeply distressing. Worse are the stories about medical professionals who suggest to children with endo that they are faking their pain for attention. It's absolutely vital that health professionals are trained in recognising the symptoms of endometriosis, and that we work to change attitudes and develop a systemic approach to diagnostics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no cure for endo currently; all can be done is alleviate symptoms with lifelong personal management plans. I want to commend the work of Syl Freedman, who is an inspiration to endo sufferers around the country. I met her a couple of years ago at an AFR Women of Influence awards night where her work in endometriosis was being celebrated. In 2014 Syl and her mother, Lesley, started EndoActive with the aim to empower women with knowledge and information about endo and to campaign for more research. Syl has had multiple surgeries for endometriosis and she experienced the added ordeals that endo sufferers face, in particular: the lack of support networks, the concerning attitudes of some medical professionals and the dearth of research that was being done on causes, treatments and cures. Worst of all, it seemed to her that nobody was talking about these problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Syl and Lesley started a national conversation. As a result of their lobbying and hard work, and the wider Coalition for Endometriosis, the Turnbull government was proud to announce the development of the national action plan to raise awareness and provide clinical research, management plans and better medical research. The health minister, Minister Hunt, has announced that the government will commit $2.5 million from the Medical Research Future Fund to accelerate research translation in the medical research priority areas identified in the National Action Plan for Endometriosis, and that endometriosis would be a feature of this year's Women's Health Week to raise its profile. I am proud to support this motion from the member for Forrest, and I am proud to be part of a government determined to provide a national action plan to address endometriosis.</span>

                  <a href="245392" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:43</span>):  I don't know if I know anyone with endometriosis, but I probably do. The more that I've learned about it, the more I know there's a high probability that I know quite a few women who are suffering with this condition. I want to thank the member for Canberra because it was after perhaps the third time that I'd heard her speaking on it in the House that I asked her: 'What is this condition? It sounds horrible.' It is for that reason, and because of her work with our colleagues opposite, that I'm speaking to this today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that it takes an average of 10 years between the symptoms starting and diagnosis makes me incredibly sad. To know that there are women, our sisters and our mums, out there in the community suffering, not being taken seriously and being affected so much is saddening, but what is encouraging is the work that's being done now. I applaud the Minister for Health for taking the action that he has, but, listening this morning, it's clear that there's a lot more that needs to be done. I want to thank the member for Forrest for moving this important motion. It is enlightening to hear how incapacitating it can be, and, obviously, for too long the serious effects haven't been given the proper attention. It's now very important that greater awareness is on the way to taking place. I want to congratulate the Parliamentary Friends of Endometriosis Awareness, sponsored not only by my friend the member for Canberra but also by the member for Boothby. They're doing great work in making all of us here in parliament more aware of the need for more research and the need for better treatments and hopefully, ultimately, a cure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I want to congratulate the Minister for Health for making funding available to the National Health and Medical Research Council for research into endometriosis and for consulting on a national action plan. As we've heard, the government's put $2.5 million in, as part of the national plan, to fund that research, and that's very important. I understand that there's been a strong response to the draft plan, which has endorsed those three key priorities areas: education and awareness, clinical management and care, and research. I look forward to the release of the final action plan, which I understand might be next month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister for health, the member for Ballarat, has expressed support for not only the work of the parliamentary friends group but also the government's initiative. It's important for everyone that's listening today, those that are here with us here in the gallery, to understand that seeking more support for women suffering endometriosis is a bipartisan effort. All of us want to see more action here, because it is complex disease that is difficult to diagnose, and, as I said, so many out there are suffering without the support that they need. Hopefully those days of medical practitioners not taking sufferers seriously are over; I sincerely hope that they are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are many support groups for women across the country. In Darwin, we have a support group that you can find on Facebook. I found it because the member for Canberra enlightened me on this. I want to also give a shout-out to some of our great specialists in the Top End; people like Dr Jenny Mitchell, Dr Andrew Miller and Dr Nader Gad. I also want to say to the government and all those working on this important issue that you have my support in raising awareness of this terrible disease and seeking better treatments and cures. I want to thank everyone that's shared their story. To those out there that are suffering from this debilitating condition: I take it seriously. I want you to remember that you are not alone.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BANKS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  I commend the member for Forrest on her important motion today and thank her for sharing her passion for eradicating this terrible condition, the chronic and progressive menstrual health disorder endometriosis, and for sharing the significant effect it can have on women, like her beloved daughter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many women in Australia like Kylie, endometriosis is a silent epidemic. For so many of our loved ones, work colleagues, friends, mothers, daughters and sisters, endometriosis has been an incredible burden, and a burden that is rarely discussed openly. For the one in 10 women of child-bearing age in Australia who suffer from endometriosis, that's almost 700,000 and potentially so many more; endometriosis is under-recognised and underdiagnosed. Indeed, delays in diagnosis and a lack of definitive research on the domestic burden of endometriosis suggest the number could be far higher. In fact, some research indicates that endometriosis is more common than breast cancer, prostate cancer and diabetes. The condition can affect all women and girls, regardless of our age, our background or our lifestyle. This is why the Turnbull government's first National Action Plan for Endometriosis is directly going to change hundreds of thousands of Australian women's lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the advocacy of the member for Boothby, the member for Canberra, the member for Forrest and the wonderful women's health advocates like Donna Ciccia, director and co-founder of Endometriosis Australia, who I hosted in Canberra recently, our government has outlined three important priority areas to help improve the lives of Australian women and girls who live with endometriosis: awareness and education, clinical management, and care and research. Our plan has been developed with endometriosis patients, who've lived and experienced the disease's tremendous burden, and researchers and clinicians from around Australia. As such, we've committed $1 million so that our doctors and nurses better understand endometriosis, as well as $2.5 million for Australia's world-class researchers to develop improved diagnosis and treatment for Australian women, meaning that the hundreds of thousands of women with endometriosis won't have to suffer in silence anymore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I anticipate that the formal launch of the national action plan, due for release in July this year, will provide a strong outline of the government's commitment to improving the rates of diagnosis. Being able to diagnose endometriosis more quickly and often more sensitively will dramatically improve the experience of thousands of women. As the chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Women's Health, I'm particularly delighted and truly proud that our government is continuously striving to improve the health outcomes for Australian women and the thousands of women in Chisholm. It is fantastic that endometriosis will be a feature of this year's Women's Health Week in September, which will significantly raise the profile and awareness of endometriosis with women around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also rise today to acknowledge that I represent one of Australia's most culturally diverse electorates. I know that women's menstrual health in particular can be quite challenging for any woman to discuss, but the stigma associated with menstrual cycles and conditions like endometriosis can make seeking help almost impossible for some women with certain culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Our National Action Plan for Endometriosis will tackle and remove these barriers to treatment, meaning that every woman across Australia, including regional women, culturally diverse women and Indigenous women, can be empowered to understand their symptoms, know that they need to seek help and that, when they do, they'll be treated with respect, love and care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government's National Action Plan for Endometriosis is a blueprint for tackling endometriosis in Australia. It will directly aim to improve the quality of life of Australian women and girls with endometriosis by improving awareness and education of endometriosis amongst the Australian community by pursuing medical research for new and improved diagnosis and treatment options. I'm grateful that our friends, our work colleagues, our daughters, our mothers and our sisters will no longer have to suffer in silence, that they will be diagnosed and that they will be able to seek treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to place on record my thanks to my colleague the member for Flinders, the minister for health, for his work on this personally to dismantle taboos that have undermined women's health policy, particularly women's menstrual and reproductive health, for far too long. Thanks to our government's national action plan, I look forward to a future where Australian women with endometriosis no longer suffer in silence and where treatment is sensitive and effective. I commend the motion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="265979" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:54</span>):  I would also like to commend this motion to the House. I'd like to congratulate the member for Forrest and also, in particular, I'd like to congratulate the co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends for Endometriosis, Gai Brodtmann, the member for Canberra, and Nicolle Flint, the member for Boothby. Also, I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the House for their comments. I really hope that we will see some action on this matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've never spoken in this House with such a feeling of guilt as I do today on this motion. My daughter, one of our six children, has suffered for many years from endometriosis. The diagnosis only became apparent following a biopsy on a groin mass, when it became clear that what she'd been suffering from for many years was in fact endometriosis. As a father, I feel guilty that I tended to downplay her complaints, and as a doctor I feel even more guilty that I downplayed her complaints and her symptoms. It's made me realise what an important issue this is and led me to look into the problem of endometriosis and how much it affects the lives of many Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Endometriosis is a common disease, affecting around 10 per cent of women in various different forms. It can cause many symptoms, many signs, including things like: recurrent abdominal pain; abdominal distention; irregular periods; menorrhagia—excessive bleeding; pain during intercourse; and lymphadenopathy—enlarged lymph nodes. Sometimes, because of the chronic nature of the symptoms, depression and anxiety can be a common feature. Some women experience weight loss. Some women find excessive tiredness and lethargy are part of the symptoms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My story is a lesson that medical professionals must learn to listen to their patients more and be more aware of a possible diagnosis of endometriosis. All of us could learn more about endometriosis. Certainly the government's commitment to funding a national action plan is a good thing. Funding for research is a good thing. But I think it's almost too little too late, and we need to do more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There do appear to be some risk factors in the development of endometriosis, and the biggest risk factor appears to be family history. There is clearly a strong genetic component. We need to be doing more in terms of looking at the genetics of endometriosis. We also have some difficulties with treatment. At the present time, there's no clear treatment plan for women suffering from endometriosis that general practitioners can follow. As my own case as shown, sometimes even having a parent who's a doctor may not be a good thing. We need to educate our medical professionals much better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The symptoms, as I mentioned, can vary from place to place and from patient to patient, and much clearer information on the symptoms needs to be given to our general practitioners so that the diagnosis can be made more quickly and easily. Treatments have been poorly researched, and we certainly need to do more in that regard. Most of all, we need to be aware of the diagnosis and we need to be doing more in terms of women's health and awareness of women's health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party is, of course, committed to doing what it can to support women's health and looking at initiatives to develop more comprehensive women's health policies. One thing it's done and has suggested the government should follow is remove the tax on sanitary products, which would at least reduce some of the cost for women. We also need to be doing a lot more in terms of providing support for women with this chronic disease. I commend the motion to the House. I congratulate the members who have spoken on it today. In particular, I congratulate Ms Marino for bringing this motion before the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first two projects involve modernisation works at the Larrakeyah Defence Precinct in Darwin. The committee understands the strategic importance of Larrakeyah in supporting Australia's operations in the north.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first proposal is for the facilities to support naval operations in the north project. This project includes construction of a new wharf and fuel storage facilities at Larrakeyah.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new wharf will allow for a variety of Navy vessels and visiting foreign warships to berth and refuel in Darwin. The estimated cost for the project is $272.5 million, excluding GST.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second proposal is the Larrakeyah Barracks redevelopment. This is a $223 million project to update ageing and non-compliant facilities at Larrakeyah Barracks. The redevelopment will provide new buildings, a more secure entry precinct, upgraded roads, water and sewerage infrastructure, and new electrical and ICT infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The barracks redevelopment will allow for the future growth of the precinct population and is required to enable and support the new wharf.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third proposal is for stage 2 of the Garden Island (East) Critical Infrastructure Recovery Program, in Sydney. The committee considered stage 1 of this program back in 2017. Stage 1 included the demolition of outdated wharves, and the construction of a new wharf.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stage 2 completes the revitalisation of Garden Island East with the repair or replacement of remaining wharves, and upgrades to base-wide engineering services, including electrical, fuel, water and sewerage, and that is predominantly so that, when ships are at berth, they can hook into what they call 'hotel mode', which allows the boats to not have to run their motors, for the comfort of those residents who now live close to the facility. The estimated cost of that project is $286.5 million, excluding GST.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to, in closing, acknowledge some of the newer committee members who have taken their place on this board and also acknowledge some outgoing contributions by committee members. Justine Keay made an invaluable contribution to the committee and, given the by-election, we'd love to have her back on the team if the weather presents itself. There are two new committee members: Senator Amanda Stoker, who replaced Senator Dean Smith, and Andrew Wallace, the member for Fisher, who brings an enormous amount of knowledge as a builder, a lawyer and a barrister specialising in the construction field. That type of knowledge fits hand-in-glove with the many years of service from Senator Gallacher, who is a longstanding member on that committee.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian public see the parliament through a very narrow prism at times, and they witness the conduct of us politicians narrowly through the prism of question time. Question time is filled with theatre and gladiatorial-type behaviour. This committee, of which I'm proud to chair, has truly at heart the taxpayers' best interests. This committee is focused on making sure that we deliver the best return for investment for the Australian tax dollar. And however combative we may be for a certain hour during the day, this committee is exemplary in the way that it shows the nation that this parliament does have an effective role to play.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will also continue to pursue greater cost savings through prying into and prodding different Defence contracts that come to us across all portfolios, whether or not they be here in Australia or through the remit of this committee where we have oversight of our foreign embassies. I'd like to thank my fellow committee members for their ongoing commitment to the Public Works Committee, which continues to work effectively and cooperatively. This year, 2018, is shaping up to be another busy year for public works. I commend this report to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  Labor supports this Treasury Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2018, which amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 and A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Act 1999.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As members would be aware, the parliament has not, with the exception of a brief period under the Fraser government, indexed income tax brackets but we do on a regular basis increase the Medicare levy low-income thresholds and the phase-in limit in accordance with movements in the consumer price index. That means that under this bill: the individual income threshold for the Medicare levy will move from $21,655 to $21,980; the family income threshold will move from $36,541 to $37,089; the individual SAPTO threshold will move from $34,244 to $34,758; the SAPTO family threshold will move from $47,670 to $48,345; and the child student component of the income threshold for families, whether eligible for SAPTO or not, will move from $3,356 to $3,406, commensurate with changes to the phase-in limits. These measures, which will amount to hundreds of dollars, are certainly warranted—they will provide modest relief to low-income households—but should not be oversold. This is a regular process. It ensures the most vulnerable Australians are not disadvantaged. It maintains their access to Medicare, Australia's world-class universal health system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time as this bill is before the House, there is much more significant debate around tackling inequality through true progressive tax changes. That debate, which is in the public domain—indeed, it was before the House in the last sittings—is over whether to change the income tax scales in a way that would see middle Australia see a significant tax cut. We on this side of the House have a commitment to providing a bigger, better and fairer tax cut. It would go to those earning less than $125,000. Those 10 million Australians would be $400 better off under the Labor proposal than under the coalition proposal. What is extraordinary is that the government refuses to split its bill; it refuses to split tax changes scheduled to take effect on 1 July this year from tax cuts that will not take effect for another two election cycles. The government needs to do the right thing on that. It needs to split the bill. It needs to provide low- and middle-income taxpayers that immediate tax relief.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The difference between the short-term and the long-term tax packages can be seen in the analysis that Danielle Wood has done for the Grattan Institute. This analysis looks at the impact on tax progressivity of the early stage and the late stage of that package. The early stage improves tax progressivity. Indeed, Labor's proposal would be an even greater improvement in tax progressivity. Under Labor's proposal, the tax system would do even more to ameliorate inequality than it currently does. But the late stage makes our tax system more regressive. According to the modelling carried out by the Grattan Institute, Australia's tax system would do less than it currently does to ameliorate inequality under that third stage of the government's tax proposals, which are not due to take effect until the 2024-25 tax year.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tackling inequality is a huge priority not just for Australia but globally. Last week saw the release of the <span style="font-style:italic;">World Inequality Report 2018</span> by economists Facundo Alvaredo, Lucas Chancel, Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. That report compiles a series of new studies, including work that has been done for Australia by the late Sir Tony Atkinson and me, and now updated by Roger Wilkins, and work on wealth inequality for Australia, which Pamela Katic and I conducted. The overall picture of global inequality is summed up by Branko Milanovic, of the City University of New York, as being 'an elephant curve'. If you plot the increase in world income distribution, you see sluggish growth at the very bottom, the tail of the elephant; more rapid growth for most of the 20th to 30th percentiles, reflecting the income growth that has occurred in China and India in particular; weak growth for the middle, the downward curve of the trunk, reflecting the squeeze on middle classes in advanced countries; and spectacular growth among the top 10 per cent, being the tip of the trunk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To enter the top one per cent of the world's wealthiest earners requires wealth of around one million euros. The wealthiest one per cent of the world now have one-third of world wealth, up from one-quarter in the mid-1990s. If you look at the wealth share of the top one in 100 million in the world, the top 75 people or so, those billionaires have seen wealth increases of around three times the global average.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to Australia21 and the Australia Institute for their work in drawing attention to the scale of the inequality challenge. In January 2014, Australia21 held an inequality roundtable in Canberra, bringing together 35 senior government officials; five parliamentarians, myself included; non-government organisations; academics; community leaders; and stakeholders. Today, Australia21 is holding another roundtable here in Parliament House on the theme, 'Dealing with economic inequality in Australia'. It's being hosted by Emeritus Professor Bob Douglas and the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan, and it is bringing together 40 experts to discuss not only the scale of the inequality challenge but what can be done to address it. The key questions being discussed are: how serious is the inequality issue in Australia? What are the factors contributing to it? What changes will be needed in Australian society to make it highly likely that economic inequality will be declining in the next 10 years? And what changes are now needed to address the problem? I again commend Australia21 and The Australia Institute for this important report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We face multiple futures when it comes to inequality. As the <span style="font-style:italic;">World inequality report</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2018</span> has made clear, if the world follows a trajectory of business as usual in which inequality rises in each country, as it's done since 1980, then we are going to see the global top one per cent increase its share of world income from 20 per cent to 24 per cent, and we will see the bottom half of the world income distribution decrease their share of world income. If we see the world follow the United States' trajectory, a high-inequality-growth trajectory, then that would mean that the global top one per cent share would go from 20 per cent to 28 per cent by 2050, and the bottom 50 per cent share would fall significantly. However, were inequality to follow the European style low-inequality-growth trajectory, then the global one per cent share would shrink to 19 per cent, and there would be significant growth in the income share of the bottom half of the population. They are the multiple futures facing the world. Do we want to go ahead and see a business-as-usual or an American trajectory in which inequality widens, where the top one per cent have more and the bottom half have less? Or do we want to consider a different path forward in which we crack down on tax havens and ensure that there are strong unions able to check inequality, that we have access to an education and healthcare system for all and that the benefits of growth are fairly shared across the community?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the contributions of the world inequality report has been to use the massive data leaks from Panama, Switzerland and Luxembourg to look at tax evasion by the very top. In the Scandinavian countries, where it is possible to match up the data leaks with individual taxpayers, it appears that the richest 0.01 per cent of Scandinavians evade over one-quarter of the personal taxes they owe by using tax havens, suggesting that the use of tax havens may be an even bigger problem in other nations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And we see, too, multinational corporations up to the same tricks. In research recently released in parallel with the world inequality report, Thomas Torslov, Ludvig Wier and Gabriel Zucman find that there is significant multinational profit-shifting occurring among the world's biggest firms. They give the example of the events in 2016 when Google Alphabet reported revenues of $19 billion in Bermuda. This is a small island in the Atlantic where Google Alphabet barely employs any workers and barely owns any tangible assets but where the corporate tax rate is zero per cent. The estimates from Torslov, Wier and Zucman are that around 40 per cent of the profits of large multinationals are shifted to low-tax jurisdictions. And this doesn't simply mean shifting where the tax is paid; it means shifting from jurisdictions where tax is paid to jurisdictions where very little tax is paid. They estimate that, for every $1 of corporate tax paid in a tax haven, $5 of corporate tax is avoided in countries with regular corporate tax rates. So we must crack down on the abuse of tax havens if we are to see more egalitarianism across the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Egalitarianism is a fundamentally Australian value. We know that when people like Mark Twain, Anthony Trollope and DH Lawrence visited Australia they remarked on Australian egalitarianism. Australian egalitarianism isn't just a Labor story, though it certainly is that. It is an Australian story, one of a nation in which we're proud not to have private areas on our beaches and not to stand up when the Prime Minister enters the room. We're proud to use the word 'mate' rather than the word 'sir'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But all of that is at threat from the rise in inequality that we've seen across the globe and in Australia over the past generation. We also see this in the area of health care. We are debating today a bill relating to Medicare, and we know that the cost of seeing both GPs and specialists has hit a new record under the Turnbull government. We know that Australians are paying more for their health. They are paying an average of $38 out of their pocket to see a GP, and it is up to $47 in some jurisdictions. That's almost a $4 increase since Prime Minister Turnbull promised that no-one would pay more to see a GP. Out-of-pocket fees to see specialists have soared even higher. They are up to almost $88 on average, an increase of about $12 since the election, and there are jurisdictions in Australia where the average out-of-pocket cost of seeing a specialist has now soared above $90.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people realise that, when you have higher out-of-pocket costs, that means that people don't go to see their doctor for those essential check-ups. We have figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing that a million Australians delay or avoid seeing their GPs every year due to cost, and another 1.7 million Australians skip specialist appointments. We're yet to see the government lifting any part of its damaging Medicare rebate freeze. Rebates for GPs, specialists and allied health services all remain fully frozen until 2020. All remain fully frozen and the freeze won't be fully lifted until 2020. As a result of this freeze, the Turnbull government is cutting more than $3 billion out of Medicare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Medicare is a fundamental part of Australian egalitarianism. Australian egalitarianism is built on the notion that we pay our fair share of tax, we make sure that multinational firms aren't able to shift their profits to tax havens and we ensure that any child who has the smarts to go to university gets a place there. But, under this government, we're seeing $17 billion being ripped out of schools and $17 billion being given to the big banks. Every dollar that is going to the big banks under Prime Minister Turnbull's corporate tax cut is coming out of Australian schools. At a time when we've got Australian test scores going backwards, according to the PISA study, and we have our banks facing an unprecedented royal commission, is it really right to take money from schools and give it to banks? The government's priorities are completely wrong. If they care about egalitarianism, as every Australian should, we need fairer tax policies, fairer education policies and fairer health policies.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  Labor has no difficulty in rising to welcome the indexation of the income thresholds below which Australians do not pay the Medicare levy or Medicare levy surcharge. This is a very standard and regular process that ensures that the most vulnerable Australians are not disadvantaged, while maintaining their access to Medicare, our world-class universal health system. It is, though, an opportunity to address the parliament about the key issue that is facing people in using Medicare, and that is that the cost of going to the GP or going to the specialist has risen. I'm talking here about the out-of-pocket costs that Australians face every day when they have to take their kids or themselves off to the GP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals' claim that Medicare has never been stronger is false; it is wrong. The out-of-pocket costs of seeing both GPs and specialists have hit new records under the current Prime Minister, with Australians now paying around $47 for a GP appointment and around $90 for a specialist appointment, or at least up to those figures in some areas. Unfortunately, what this increase in out-of-pocket costs means is that there are Australians who are not going to the doctor. They are holding off from going to see a doctor, even when they're sick, because they're worried about what might happen in terms of the cost of seeing the GP. If they're making a choice between taking their kids to the doctor or taking themselves to the doctor, they are making sure that they hold off to make sure that their kids can go. In fact, the ABS figures show that 1 million Australians delay or avoid seeing their GP each year due to cost, with another 1.7 million Australians skipping specialist appointments. This should be incredibly alarming for everyone here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a terrible indictment on this government that there are Australians skipping medical appointments, not going to the GP and not going to the specialist because of the cost. The Turnbull government really needs to lift its game when it comes to Medicare. The Prime Minister himself went to the last election promising that no-one would pay more to see a GP, but the out-of-pocket costs are higher than they have ever been, and this trend will only get worse because of this government's obstinate refusal to properly address the Medicare freeze problem that they created. The freeze won't be fully lifted until 2020, and that's really shameful. The government really needs to take a good, hard look at itself and take action in respect of making sure people can afford to go to the doctor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost in my electorate is very high. In fact, my electorate of Griffith has the highest out-of-pocket costs for seeing a GP of any electorate in Queensland. It's almost $40 in out-of-pocket costs in my electorate of Griffith, on the south side of Brisbane. For our state of Queensland there was a recent increase of nearly 7½ per cent in GP out-of-pocket costs, year on year. The situation is even worse when it comes to specialist appointments. In fact, in Queensland, the year-on-year increase is 21.56 per cent. That's how much out-of-pocket costs have increased—by more than a fifth—to go to a specialist in Queensland, and it's a disgrace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the government has been out in the media trying to trumpet a static GP bulk-billing rate shows just how out of touch they are. If you're a parent, if you've got young kids, you don't want to have to worry about the cost of going to the doctor if they're sick. You don't want to have to make choices between pharmaceuticals for yourself and taking your kids to the doctor. Yet that's what skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs do to people and to families. People in my electorate should not be put in a situation where the out-of-pocket costs for visiting a GP or a specialist are skyrocketing. This government needs to address this because the Commonwealth should be providing a universal healthcare system, and a healthcare system where people have to pay high out-of-pocket costs to see a doctor is not a truly universal one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people are too smart to fall for the spin that somehow Medicare is strong under this government, because they know from their own firsthand experience that the cost of going to the doctor is very high. It's laughable to claim that Medicare has never been stronger. It's laughable for this government to claim that their commitment to Medicare is rock solid. Australians know the truth. The government can get up and complain all they like about Labor campaigning in respect of their plans for Medicare at the last election. The reason we were campaigning about what this government was going to do to Medicare is because the Liberals cannot be trusted when it comes to Medicare. The Liberals can't be trusted not to Americanise our healthcare system. The Liberals can't be trusted to protect and defend Medicare. The Liberals cannot be trusted to address out-of-pocket costs for GPs and out-of-pocket costs for specialists, just like they can't be trusted on private health insurance. They have refused to meet our commitments to cap premium rate rises when it comes to private health insurance. They're not interested in this crucial cost-of-living issue for Australian families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian families deserve better. Australian families deserve a Commonwealth government that will speak up and, more importantly, will pay up to make sure that we have a universal healthcare system so that everyone can see a doctor, no matter their personal circumstances, and so that your access to health care is determined by your Medicare card, not by your credit card. That's what a Labor government would do. I know that Australians are thinking very carefully about the future of this country after the next federal election, and they're thinking a lot about health care. I say to the Australian people: Labor created Medicare and only Labor will ensure that Australians can access the health care they deserve. It's time for a government that will stand up for people's ability to go to the doctor without having to reach so deeply into their pockets, without having to make those terrible choices between medicine and GP visits, without having to worry about the impact that going to the doctor will have on their family budget and without having to worry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is Australia. In Australia you don't have to worry about whether you can afford to go to the doctor. That's the Australia that I want to live in. That's the Australia that I grew up in. But this Liberal government don't care. If they cared they would have done something about it a long time ago. We've had a Liberal government in this country for five years now, and we're seeing the consequences of that when you look at the out-of-pocket cost increases for Australian families. They haven't done enough, and that's because they can't be trusted when it comes to health care.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs SUDMALIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  The words I present today are to address the Treasury Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2018. Every government since 1996-97 has generally decided to increase the low-income thresholds in line with the positive movements of the CPI each year. We all know what CPI means, but, just as a reminder, the consumer price index is a formal way of buying a whole range of items that could be part of household costs, averaging it out and comparing it with the last time the task was done. The increase, through a range of calculations, results in the CPI. The CPI figure is used by many different government departments to calculate a range of changes that apply to pensions and other income support mechanisms. We know that age pensions go up in March and September every year in line with CPI. More importantly, if we don't change the taxable threshold in line with that rise in CPI then people who currently don't pay extra, including the Medicare levy, will have to pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Essentially, this bill is about changing the threshold of low-income families before they have to start paying the fees or levies. It's about reducing the impact on low-income families. The Medicare levy low-income threshold makes sure that people who pay no personal income tax because of the tax-free threshold and structural offsets, like the low-income tax offset or the seniors and pensioners tax offset, generally don't pay the Medicare levy yet are able to get into the Medicare system. This is an essential part of ensuring that everyone who does not currently pay continues to not have to pay. It is part of our government guaranteeing the essential services that Australians rely on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A stronger economy has enabled the government to deliver record investment in Medicare, hospitals, schools and disability services. Australians have guaranteed access to high-quality hospitals and schools, not because we have the lion's share of direct funding to either hospitals or schools but because we have strong agreements with the state governments about investment in these two essential parts of our daily lives that affect all our families. In addition, we have the revenue for the delivery of a strong Medicare system, which is vital and needs to be there to provide the services to those with permanent and significant disabilities as well as those who get ill or who need to go to the doctor or a specialist. One of the problems is that we don't have enough doctors or specialists out there who bulk-bill. That is an issue. But if we've got a good Medicare system then we've got choices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking about choice, we're providing more choice for older Australians to live healthier, more independent and safer lives so that they can take advantage of the opportunities that a longer life brings. It's not just about house cleaning, daily nurses visiting or carers coming to help with daily walks for someone recovering from a knee replacement. Each and every activity like these helps our older people have a better time, a quality time, while they remain in their own homes. A government cannot invest in such services unless there is a very strong economy to back that up—and we are doing exactly that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our record investment in schools will give teachers the tools to lift the performance of their students and prepare them for the jobs of the future. As a former science teacher, I'm proud that we have delivered these reforms. I've seen fantastic changes in my local schools where the additional investment has been allocated to teacher training and student courses that have never been offered before. We're looking at recommendations from the review to achieve educational excellence in Australian schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From July 2018, the government will ease the cost-of-living pressures for nearly a million Australian families by implementing the new childcare package. And I take this opportunity to remind families in my electorate to register: there are about 5,000 families in Gilmore who will absolutely be better off, but they do need to register.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have record levels of funding going to hospital services, the Medicare Benefits Schedule and pharmaceutical benefits. Just recently, I had Stan come in. He has lung cancer, and we've put his drug on the PBS. So, instead of it costing him 350 bucks a pop, it's the cost of a script. I then had Richard, who has trouble breathing. A new drug has come through the PBS, so that instead of $204 a hit it's the cost of a script.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you don't have a strong economy you simply can't deliver these changes, and we're doing it. We're trying to get rural health stronger and I know that all the people who I have seen in my local area want to make this better as well. We're working hard with the National Disability Insurance Scheme. In fact, our revenue is so good that we don't have to change the Medicare levy; we've actually got the funding there to support this scheme for all our people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Medicare Guarantee Fund is going to be increased. An additional $34.4 billion has gone to this fund, and a further credit of $35.3 billion will be made to meet the estimated MBS and PBS expenditure in 2018-19. We've got cystic fibrosis testing, 3D breast cancer screening and MRI tests for prostate cancer. You can't do any of that unless you've got the revenue to support that, and we're doing that. I think it's fantastic we've got solar coming into the local regions and community groups. Again, these are grants and subsidies that can only come out through a strong economy. There are a whole stack of things that have been brought through for people with diabetes. There is the insulin pump for young children—an investment of $6.2 million, and I would like to give a shout out to the DENNY Foundation, who were great advocates for that, with Pieta Newport and Marg Smith involved locally. They really got me involved in it and made me understand how important that was.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Medicare is not at risk. With an additional one million jobs, that's a huge increase in revenue for the Medicare levy, not to mention the huge investment by the government. This is an outstanding investment from a strong government with strong revenue streams. I commend the bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MORRISON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  Firstly, I'd like to thank those members who contributed to this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2018. I particularly thank the member for Gilmore, who I think has set the matter out incredibly well. A stronger economy means the government no longer needs to proceed with the change in the Medicare levy as we advised before the budget this year. It also means the government is able to increase the Medicare levy low-income threshold as set out in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through our plan for a stronger economy, the Turnbull government is guaranteeing essential services that Australians rely on. Funding for Medicare has been guaranteed in legislation by this government, as we promised we would—another commitment kept. But there's a much stronger guarantee that this government provides for Medicare, for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, for social security payments, for childcare support, for schools funding, for hospitals funding and for any area of essential service and support that the government provides. And that is that this government has a plan for a stronger economy that's delivering. The Labor Party can make whatever claim they like about what they think they're going to spend, but if they don't have a plan for a stronger economy they can't pay for it. And, when they hear 'revenue', all they hear is the need to increase taxes. When we hear that, we know the need to create a stronger economy that generates the revenue—not to tax the economy out of existence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A stronger economy is what guarantees Medicare. A stronger economy is what guarantees schools funding. A stronger economy guarantees the essential services that Australians rely on. Essential services aren't guaranteed by politicians making promises, like the Labor Party does. They're guaranteed by governments that know how to support and grow an economy—as this government has overseen, with more than a million people getting jobs over the last five years. A million people have got jobs over the last five years. That's a simple fact, and they've been created by Australian businesses. Australian businesses have created those jobs—Australian businesses that have been benefitting from the pro-business, pro-economic policies that enable them to grow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party has a proposal for business and the economy, and that's to tax them out of business. If you tax businesses out of business, what happens is you don't have the money to guarantee Medicare and you don't have the money to list important life-saving drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. If you don't have policies for a stronger economy, you don't have a policy for Medicare. If you don't have a policy for a stronger economy and a plan, you don't have a policy for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. All you have are glib promises that you can't back up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill ensures—and demonstrates once again—that, through the strong economic and financial management of the Turnbull government, we are in a position to be able to move forward on this measure. The bill will assist Australians on low incomes by continuing to exempt them from paying the Medicare levy. These changes will ensure that low-income households who did not pay the Medicare levy in the 2016-17 income year will generally continue to be exempt in the 2017-18 income year if their incomes have risen in line with or less than the consumer price index. For individual taxpayers, no Medicare levy will be payable for those with a taxable income that does not exceed $21,980 in 2017-18, which has increased from $21,655. Single senior pensioners with no dependants who are eligible for the seniors and pensioners tax offset will not incur a Medicare levy liability if their taxable income does not exceed $34,758 in 2017-18, which has increased from $34,244. As well as these individual thresholds, further relief is available for low-income couples and families. The amendments to the Medicare levy low-income thresholds apply to the 2017-18 year of income and future income years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the government's plan for a stronger economy is delivering more jobs and it's guaranteeing essential services that Australians rely on—and it is making sure that we do all of that while ensuring that the government continues to live within its means. That is at the heart of the government's approach to guaranteeing those essential services. It's something you can take to the bank—because, if you have a stronger economy, you can take it to the bank. Otherwise, it's just a promise that you have to take back to the Labor Party—a promise that they can never deliver on because they cannot run a stronger economy. But I welcome Labor's support for this bill. They are just fortunate that there's a Turnbull government in place that can run a strong budget and a strong economy that can pay for it. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

These men and women, as I have said so many times in this place, have fought for the freedoms that we experience every day. I will fight to protect them in this place because they deserve absolutely no less.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  I rise in support of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 2) Bill 2018. I commend the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Personnel and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC, who has worked on this bill, which is all about ensuring that our veterans and their families have access to the support and services they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year, I'm advised, more than 5,000 service men and women will leave active duty to move on to the next chapter in their lives. We as a community and as a government must do all that we can to support our veterans and their families when they do move to the next stage in their lives, because these veterans have given so much to our country and it is only right that we support those who have made such incredible sacrifices for our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not always easy. At a regular veterans' round table I host with local veteran organisations, I hear too often about many of the challenges that they face. These include finding work and navigating through the transition to meaningful employment after their service. At these round tables, I also hear about the challenges faced by veteran support organisations, such as the paperwork, the time-consuming application forms and, of course, the need to access supportive mental health services. These are major challenges and they are not always easy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On a local level, we're able to help out with activities around Veterans' Health Week, where organisations across my electorate of Robertson host events in support of veterans' health. This year from 22 September to 30 September, organisations across the electorate will take part in Veterans' Health Week, with this year's theme focusing on nutrition. For ex-service organisations in my electorate, there's funding available to assist with events for Veterans' Health Week. Applications are now open and close on 29 June, so I would encourage ex-service organisations across my electorate to apply. If they would like to do so, visit the website: dva.gov.au.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point, I'd also like to pay tribute to the incredible veterans' community on the Central Coast, which supports local ex-service men and women year round. We are lucky to have a number of ex-service organisations supporting more than 2,000 veterans in our community. Our veterans' organisations are led by some incredible men and women. I'd like to acknowledge the extraordinary individuals that lead these organisations locally: Vietnam Veterans Peacekeepers &amp; Peacemakers Association of Australia Central Coast sub-branch led by Stephen Karsai; the Gosford RSL Sub Branch, led by President Greg Mawson; Peter White from the Terrigal Wamberal RSL Sub Branch; Mal Roberts from Veterans Plus; Gosford's 311 Squadron of the Australian Air Force Cadets, led by Neal Rogers; Brisbane Waters Legacy, led by Max Davis and Peter Lawley; the Central Coast Interactive War Exhibit, led by Andrew Church; the president of the Davistown RSL Sub Branch, Paul Osborn; Maureen Bland from the Partners of Veterans Association Central Coast sub-branch; and the New South Wales National Servicemen's Association &amp; Affiliates Inc., led by Alf Hill. Each and every one of these organisations and individuals does an incredible job of supporting our local veterans. Whether it be through commemorative services and activities, advocacy and support services or through social activities, I'm proud to say that our local organisations do outstanding work in supporting our ex-service men and women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation helps implement initiatives to ensure that these veterans on the Central Coast are supported and have access to essential services as they make the transition to civilian life. This bill also builds on and continues the significant work the government is undertaking to better support our veterans in other ways as well. For example, earlier this year, in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No.1) Act 2018, this government introduced a suite of eight measures relating to veterans' payments, family support payments and a new mental health pilot program, as well as measures to strengthen and streamline existing measures designed to ensure our veterans are supported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures, along with those introduced earlier in the year, are in response to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report—<span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">onstant </span><span style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span style="font-style:italic;">attle: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">uicide by </span><span style="font-style:italic;">v</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eterans</span>. Schedule 1 of the bill will mean that a veteran studying full time as part of a return-to-work plan will be able to receive 100 per cent of their incapacity payments, up from 75 per cent after 45 weeks. This means that each year around 150 veterans will have financial certainty as they transition back into the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of the bill relates to the new Veteran Suicide Prevention Pilot. This pilot will trial a suicide prevention service designed to provide support for our ex-service men and women who are at risk of suicide as a result of mental health or other challenges. Initially, the pilot will be rolled out across nine hospitals in Brisbane for members of the Australian Defence Force with at least one day of full-time service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 will provide an increase to the amount of time wholly dependent partners eligible for compensation have to decide the way in which they would like to receive their compensation. This is obviously an incredibly difficult time for those who have lost a loved one, and this schedule will mean that no decision needs to be made for two years. This change means that in an incredibly tough time widowed partners can focus on what matters and take their time to make important decisions about the financial future of their family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 will extend the Long Tan Bursary eligibility so that grandchildren of Vietnam veterans will now be able to receive a Long Tan Bursary. Schedule 5 will mean that a submariner's service between 1 July 1978 and 31 December 1992 will now be deemed 'operational', addressing some of the challenges associated with their making injury claims. In schedule 6, changes to the way in which veterans are able to make compensation claims are set to streamline the process. Veterans covered under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 will now be able to make claims for compensation verbally as well as in writing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to focus on schedule 2 for a moment—the new Veteran Suicide Prevention Pilot. Mental health and suicide continues to be an incredibly serious issue in our community, particularly for ex-service men and women. It is an issue I take seriously. It is an issue that is raised with me almost every week by a member of our veteran community on the Central Coast. I am very pleased to see that this government is taking this issue seriously as well. We will establish a new veterans' suicide prevention pilot to deliver intensive and assertive management services to veterans following an attempted suicide or those at significant risk of suicide. This pilot is about linking non-government and government support services to support vulnerable veterans and their families. It will be offered at nine public and private hospitals in Brisbane. I look forward to following this pilot closely, with the hope that the program will be able to be accessed by veterans in my electorate in the near future. This is an issue that has previously been raised not only with me individually but also at roundtable discussions that I hold with veterans, and I know it is something our ex-service organisations on the Central Coast are very passionate about seeing addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trek 4 Vets is just one of those organisations that are committed to improving the lives of veterans across the nation. It was started a few years ago by Dean Luland and Andrew Papadopoulos. Trek 4 Vets is a non-profit organisation raising awareness and promoting suicide awareness within our community. Dean enlisted as a combat engineer with the Australian Defence Force back in 2006 and served for eight years until he was discharged in 2011. Since returning to civilian life, Dean has dedicated his life to raising awareness and supporting other returned service men and women. One of the incredible initiatives that has been run by Trek 4 Vets is their Midnight2Dawn March. The march starts at just before midnight on the night before Anzac Day, with trekkers assembled at the campground at Putty Beach in my electorate. The group then hikes for 20 kilometres through the Bouddi National Park, finishing about five hours later at Terrigal Beach just in time for the Anzac Day dawn service hosted by the Terrigal Wamberal RSL Sub Branch. The march is a chance for hikers, and indeed our whole community, to remember those who have served our nation and those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. Unfortunately, the walk wasn't able to take place this year. But I am advised that the Midnight2Dawn March will be back in 2019, with the aim of eventually having groups marching right across the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To those in my electorate who have served our country so well, and to everyone in my community: if you are struggling, or someone you know is struggling, I urge you to reach out to one of the support services that are available. You can contact the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service on 1800011046, the Australian Defence Force support line on 1800628036 or Lifeline on 131114.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to place on record my thanks and appreciation of all service men and women—those who have returned, those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice and those who are currently serving. Our nation owes you a debt of gratitude and we thank you for your service. I support this bill and I will continue to work with local ex-service organisations and the member for Gippsland to ensure our veterans have access to all the support they need. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="IJ4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to speak in this debate and indicate that the Labor Party, as has been outlined by our shadow minister, will be supporting this bill. I want to comment favourably on the contributions that have been made by others. I want to make an observation. Here in this parliament we have a number of veterans, one of whom, the member for Eden-Monaro, is sitting beside me. We've just had a bit of a chat about the importance of making sure that we understand and comprehend the daily grind that many veterans face, that we have tools in place to address their needs and their families' needs and, most particularly, that we appreciate that there are many who, whilst serving, may not have exhibited the traits that ultimately leave their mark on them, particularly in terms of mental health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is really very, very important that we, as a parliament, recognise the challenges that many Defence Force personnel face not only during their service but, sadly, on transition and, for many, some years later. Because what's clear from all the work that's been done over many years now is that there are many people who will transition out of the Defence Force thinking they're as bulletproof as they were when they were in, only to find, over a period of time, that actually they're not. I'm reminded that there is evidence showing that around 30 per cent of people who have separated from the Defence Force remain unemployed after five years. That says a lot not only about the individuals but about our failure to comprehend their real needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue, though, in part, is: do we know who they are? One of the things that bedevils the Department of Veterans' Affairs and indeed the Department of Defence is keeping track of people who have transitioned out of the Defence Force and knowing that they're okay. Whilst there are unit organisations that try and keep people attached, often that doesn't work. People, for whatever reason, decide they've had enough—'I don't want to talk to any more uniforms, and you, Sir, can get to buggery.' Over time, some of them come to realise that that was not a good decision, but, more importantly, they may not have realised that it wasn't a good decision but now have an illness as a result of their service which they need to address. We, in this place, have an extreme responsibility to make sure that they get the help and assistance that they and their families need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this legislation because it deals with a number of areas, as has been outlined by others, in a way which will make life easier for some but certainly treat the ailments of others. That's what's really important. The suicide prevention trials are absolutely essential. Whilst we know that the suicide rate for people in service, in uniform, is less than it is for the general population, it's an open question as to what it really is postuniform over a period of years. We've got to get our heads around it. Just contemplate this: my good friend sitting next to me has served in a theatre of war. I'm not sure how many postings he had, but the point is he's been posted to a theatre of war. There are people who, over a short period of their lives, maybe five or 10 years, have been deployed seven, eight, nine or 10 times. Particularly for those who have served in the special forces, the issues are extreme. We've got to understand not only the difficulties that they've confronted whilst in service but also the compounding effects of their continuing service, potentially, on them as individuals and on their families. Once we start down that road, we'll have a far more open attitude. I think we already are accepting, but we need a far more open attitude to some of the difficulties that people are confronting. I think this legislation helps us in that regard, both for particular individuals and for their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might just make the observation that we've got to be conscious that the day you go to Kapooka or to RMC and put on that uniform, you are effectively a client of DVA. We need to get people to realise that putting on the uniform means they are now a potential client—if you are not a client already, you should understand what DVA can do for you—and DVA, conversely, needs to make sure that the soldiers, sailors and air men and women understand what DVA can do for them. That's important whilst they're in uniform so that, when they leave the uniform behind, they can comprehend absolutely, understand and know where they can get assistance, should they require it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the member for Ryan is at the table. Sadly, she has been treated very shabbily by her own political party, but she is someone for whom I have the greatest respect and whose son I know. He is currently an officer in the Australian Army. I know the member for Ryan appreciates this, but I'm not sure everyone in this chamber—or in the Senate for that matter—does, and I know I didn't for a long time. I had a commitment to the Defence Force and a commitment to and an understanding of people who had served, because my own father and his father and uncles had all been part of the service, but getting integrally involved in the nature of the service gave me a comprehension that I hitherto didn't have. I know that the member for Ryan appreciates absolutely what this means for her and her family, and for her son's family. In two weeks time we'll be commemorating the famous victory of General Monash at Le Hamel 100 years ago. We need to understand that, each time, in 100 years of war—the First World War, the Boer War before it and subsequent wars—we, the Australian nation, are asking people like the member for Ryan's son to go and fire bullets on our behalf. We, as a consequence, have an obligation, and that obligation cannot be underestimated. I fear that there are still some—not amongst us, I hope—who underestimate that challenge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the support for our Defence Force and Defence Force personnel is, clearly, now strongly bipartisan. We may have different views about policy and about whether or not we should be engaged in particular circumstances. But one thing is beyond doubt, and that is our united support in a bipartisan way for Defence Force men and women and their families and for veterans. We need to comprehend that a young person who, at the age of 17 or 18, marches to Kapooka for their recruit training could potentially be a client of DVA for the rest of their life, as could their children. And, should they marry, we know that the highest number of people being cared for by Veterans' Affairs at the moment are spouses of Defence Force members who have passed away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's a broad family we're talking about here. It's a community that we need to have more to do with. Those of us who have had the great fortune of interacting with veterans understand their commitment, obviously, but we also understand their needs. Sadly, at times, some people's needs aren't properly addressed or aren't recognised, and those people fall through the gaps. We have to appreciate that when we deal with these people, we have to be prepared to deal with them sensitively and make sure that their needs are properly addressed and met. If mistakes have been made, they've got to be fixed. My experience with the Department of Veterans' Affairs has been that, overwhelmingly, the commitment is to the veteran. The systems sometimes fail us, and we have got to make sure that we provide the support so the systems do not to fail us. I think that the measures in this piece of legislation will help in that regard in a very positive way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know my time's about up. I'll continue to speak until 1.30, because I don't want my colleague on the other side to get up on his pins and speak for 30 seconds and be told to sit down. It is important that we all recognise the value in this legislation. We do have differences from time to time. We have policy differences on some areas regarding veterans, but, generally speaking, when we know we can work together we do. I want to commend the government for initiating this legislation and the opposition for giving its support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just go back, if I may, to the 100th anniversary of Le Hamel. Once you've read some of this history, it's intriguing to understand why people do particular things and how gravely they do them. Most importantly, we need to understand the sacrifices made for us. Whether it was 100 years ago or today, those sacrifices are still being made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia must invest generously towards maintaining and upgrading our technological capabilities to ensure that, as an economy, we have the best chance of competing with the rest of the world. As a result of it's handling, the NBN has simply not turned out the way that I and many other young people will have wanted. Many of us are still stuck behind slow download speeds, especially during peak usage hours. I speak for many in asking for an improvement in our current situation. As a Twenty-First Century child, I have grown up in a world surrounded by technology and the internet, and it has shaped my life greatly, and will continue to impact my life and the lives of those in my generation. I use modern technology in both work and play. We can make use of it to talk with friends and family, or entertain ourselves. But we must be aware that it is impacting the way we work now, and will work in the future. New jobs and fields are being created because of technology.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">While I cannot say for certain what exactly the future holds, I can say for sure that technology will play a very large part.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  On the weekend I visited Roxby Downs for the 10th handover of the Rotary club there. Congratulations to Sandy Sumsion and the team.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's 30 years since the township of Roxby Downs was set out in the desert plains, 560 kilometres north of Adelaide. The town was established to provide a home for workers at the newly established Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium mine in 1988. Roxby Downs today has a population of 4½ thousand people. There are about 1,000 children of school age and below in the community. Of these, about 800 attend the Roxby Downs Area School R-12, making it the largest area school in South Australia. Roxby Downs also has St Barbara's Catholic parish school, catering for students to year 6—St Barbara being the patron saint of mining.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With an average population age of 29 years, Roxby Downs is also amongst the highest birthrate communities in Australia. It is a vibrant town with first-class facilities and is a great place to live, work and raise a family. It presents a direct contrast to the FIFO workplaces, with all the associated strains that that lifestyle places on families. As well as servicing Olympic Dam, Roxby Downs is a regional centre for Andamooka, Woomera and surrounding pastoral stations. The copper ore body has been assessed as having a 500-year life at current extraction rates. Roxby Downs and Olympic Dam mine are fabulous resources for the state and the nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  Every day, while this government sits by and does nothing, hundreds of thousands of Australians are continuing to be ripped off by payday loan sharks. I refer to Fairfax media on the weekend, which outlined the government's incompetence and reluctance in dealing with this matter. It's been 1,046 days since they first signalled their intent to do something about this out-of-control industry, and we're yet to see any meaningful action by this government. We're seeing Australians forced to pay outrageous interest rates of almost 900 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind the House that we did see a glimmer of hope from those opposite when they released their draft legislation, but we know that the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services was quickly rolled on the issue. I refer to media over the weekend, which quite rightly pointed out that this side of the chamber led by Bill Shorten eventually put legislation on this issue to the parliament, but not a single coalition MP rose to support it. Now things are spiralling out of control. We're seeing reports of automatic loan machines popping up in suburban shopping centres, allowing some of Australia's most disadvantaged communities to take out loans worth thousands of dollars with their bank cards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know it's going to take the leadership of a Shorten Labor government to fix this mess and stop vulnerable Australians being ripped off by loan sharks. Today I call on the government to bring forward legislation on this matter and protect vulnerable Australians who are being ripped off every single day.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  I'm delighted to announce that the fantastic Australian Business Week, ABW, program for school students is set to start once again on the northern Gold Coast. The ABW northern collegiate comprises grade 11 students from Pacific Pines State High School, Helensvale State High School, Coombabah State High School, Upper Coomera State College, Pimpama State Secondary College and Ormeau Woods State High School. This immersive, practical and hands-on ABW secondary school program engages emerging adults—our future leaders—in a virtual world of business for a week. The students get a real, adult experience and learn vital business, workplace and life skills all at the same time. Participants form teams and assume management roles to run a virtual company, making important business decisions as they compete against each other and the participating teams. The students are able to try their hand and gain experience in business organisations such as manufacturing, IT, hospitality, tourism, retail and food services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The students are supported by a fantastic team of local teachers, and a special mention goes to Susie Pepper from Ormeau Woods State High School for her wonderful work as the ABW coordinator for our region. In addition to the support of teachers and parents, the students in the ABW program are also supported by local businesses and mentors, and I'm delighted to be formally involved in the program again this year. I offer my full support to this wonderful program. Good luck to all the students involved.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It makes us wonder if we're doing enough for mental health. Certainly a passionate and dedicated associate strongly believes that we are not, and his primary concerns I echo here. Recently he sent me a copy of the consultation survey re mental health and suicide produced for the Mental Health Commission. He said: 'The materials in the proposed strategy are essentially the same as have been delivered since 1997. Given that our suicide rates have risen in that time, I believe this strategy will also fail to save people's lives.' He often told me that 'the group most in need of suicide prevention support are adult men who are not mentally ill and who usually make one attempt and die'. Andrew is not a psychiatrist, or a 'shrink'; he links his clients to housing, to Centrelink, to legal advice about child support or financial help. When he sees them, they live. He's a male social worker with an agenda of keeping men at risk alive. Chief Inspector Steve Johnson, in your honour I will continue to work on this very different approach.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Today I rise to express my disappointment, along with that of many of my constituents who have contacted me over the last few days, with Optus and the Optus World Cup sports app, which has frustrated many across the country. Why is it that the people's game, the world game, is broadcast exclusively on a streaming network that can't deliver for customers and fans? That's the question that has been asked. As I said, we—not just me but also others in this place—have been inundated by constituents who are frustrated at not being able to watch games of the World Cup.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014, there were 3.2 billion viewers worldwide watching World Cup games. Not only are all games not available on another network, customers who did sign up to Optus were charged around $15 for a streaming app that can't cope, with absolutely no redundancy. We don't see this happen in other codes, like AFL, for example. We see complimentary streaming services for other codes, not exclusive agreements to lock fans out, as is happening with this particular app at Optus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on Optus to immediately refund customers for a service that hasn't worked as advertised. I ask Optus not to make people jump through hoops, but to do the right thing and refund constituents now. I've requested a meeting with the Optus chairman, Mr Paul O'Sullivan, next week to pass on the frustrations felt by many in the community and by many of my constituents. It's time to treat the world game and the football community with respect. Optus should admit that they got it wrong and refund and refund the fees ASAP.</span>

I was very honoured to be asked to be the patron of the 2018 City of Logan Relay For Life. It meant a lot because this amazing fundraiser has become one of the great local traditions in our community, raising much-needed funds and awareness for people battling cancer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Held in late May, this year's event attracted 25 teams, with more than 230 participants and an additional 500 people visiting on the night. Thanks to the tremendous community effort, more than $28,000 was raised for this worthy cause. Its support is absolutely irreplaceable in the Logan community. Every year it is a pleasure to see our relay teams work together to support this amazing effort of funding cancer research. It's easy to see why Relay For Life gets so much support each and every year. In addition to that, there are many local community groups who also hold Biggest Morning Tea events to raise funds for cancer research.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone knows somebody affected by cancer. When somebody we love is diagnosed it unites friends, families and communities, and this is why this fundraising is so important to provide those support services. Thanks to everyone involved.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Denison</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  The A-League is expanding and FFA is due to announce a shortlist of new teams very shortly. If common sense prevails, Hobart will be one of them. Hurrah, I say, because a Hobart A-League team would be a wonderful rallying point for the community. It would inject millions of dollars into the Tasmanian economy, boost TV audiences and establish soccer as the only true national football code.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken to the proponents on a number of occasions, including Harry Stamoulis and Robert Belteky. I'm confident they've got a strong proposal. Considering FFA encouraged Mr Stamoulis personally to lodge an expression of interest, I hold out hope that Hobart will be in the mix. I hope too that the Hobart team consortium has addressed the W-League in its proposal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tasmanian government has an important role to play here. The Premier needs to commit publicly to supporting not only a Hobart A-League team but also a purpose-built rectangular soccer stadium in the city. I have also taken this proposal to the Prime Minister, who seemed genuinely interested. He also needs to commit publicly to supporting a Hobart A-League team. Let's hope that politicians and the Football Federation of Australia see the benefits of a Tasmanian team and what that will do for Tasmania and for football nationally.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  I rise to offer my thanks to the Minister for Small and Family Business, the member for Reid, who last week visited my electorate of Farrer and signed off on what I regard as a landmark agreement with his Victorian and New South Wales counterparts. The aim is to ease the burden of doing business in cross-border regions. An MOU has existed between New South Wales and Queensland for seven years, but no deal has existed between New South Wales and Victoria. With new bipartisan support in Victoria for a cross-border commissioner, we now have the chance to cut the red tape which small and big businesses inevitably run into at some stage or another.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last 117 years of federation have allowed the states to make good laws, but not always very consistent laws. The minister gave one of the crazier examples, from a Victorian caravan manufacturer who can legally carry three caravans on the back of a truck to the New South Wales border. They then have to unload one of the vans because only two caravans can be transported on the same truck in New South Wales. The law changes again at the Queensland border, where three vans can be carried again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This new tripartite agreement formed on the border will attack inconsistent regulations confronted by tradies, local taxies, students, pubs, clubs and many more. Ensuring industry spends less time on regulation or compliance so that they can focus on growth is a key policy intent of our government and absolutely vital for the economic future of the communities that I represent.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  We've lost more women to sexual violence and family violence. I admire those who are using their grief and fury to call for change and those who've made personal disclosures, but we shouldn't have to package up private trauma and serve it up for public consumption in order to get change.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister is fond of saying that violence against women starts with disrespect, but where does the disrespect come from? Violence against women and their children is structural. We need genuine change. We don't need to be told not to walk through a park alone. Every day, all women think about how to protect themselves. It's natural; it's the noise in the back of your head, something that you do almost automatically. 'Where are my keys? Should I hold them in my fingers? Should I look like I'm on the phone so that people behind me think that I'm talking to someone? If someone's walking behind me, do I walk a little faster but not so fast that they know that they have me worried?' These things are things that every woman in here knows—every single woman in this chamber and every single woman outside it. We know what we do to protect ourselves. No more women should have to die—no more women, Aboriginal women, no more women with disabilities. This must end.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Today, with the support of the federal government, the Sunshine Coast is leading the way in improving Australia's mental health. With the pioneering discoveries at the federally funded Thompson Institute, our new $1.8 billion Sunshine Coast University Private Hospital and the work of local charity endED, our community is making a difference. Last week, I joined the Minister for Health in announcing another groundbreaking pilot program in Fisher which will help to transform the treatment of eating disorders across our nation. Under the Turnbull government's $3.2 million investment, the Butterfly Foundation will train local health professionals on the Sunshine Coast in how best to diagnose and treat eating disorders and how to refer patients to the pilot. Over its three-year term, treatment will then be offered by the local PHN to around 240 local patients, including up to 50 psychotherapy sessions for people with anorexia nervosa or other complex eating disorders. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation will be undertaken by the Butterfly Foundation following the end of the pilot which will inform treatment for patients with eating disorders all over Australia.</span>

I'm grateful to the minister for choosing the Sunshine Coast for this important pilot program.</span>

It might've happened walking home, going to your car in an empty car park, heading down a corridor, in your hotel room or opening the door to your home. For women who are experiencing family violence, that fear is a constant. For one young woman, Eurydice Dixon, that moment turned to tragedy. Her death in a popular Melbourne park used by hundreds of people every day has shocked our state, our city and our nation. My heart goes out to her family and her friends, the people who love her. To see such a vibrant life full of possibility cut short in such a brutal way is unfathomable. We want our women and our girls to go bravely into the world, to embrace all that life has to offer and to be able to do anything, limited by nothing. None of us want to live with that awful moment of fear, but the reality is that we do. It is not all of us every single day, but we do on some days, in some places, with some people and in some moments. We don't want to live with that fear. We're exhausted by the struggle of it and we need help. Men have to step up. That is why there has been such an outpouring of grief, anger, commentary and analysis over this tragic death. She is one of us; she is all of us. Things have to change.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  On the Central Coast, Labor are once again running another false scare campaign around health—this time regarding access to GPs on the peninsula. The fact is that since the coalition government first identified this longstanding challenge—a challenge that Labor failed to address during their six years in government—we've delivered $100,000 to the Hunter, New England and Central Coast Primary Health Network working group to tackle both the short-term need and the development of long-term strategies to properly address the shortage of GPs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to Labor's scare campaign, since this funding was first announced last year, a total of seven new GPs and registrars have already started working on the peninsula, and the working group will continue to work on investing in other workforce initiatives to help solve this challenge in the longer term as well. We know that the working group is working effectively, because there are now two new permanent GPs in Umina Beach; one new GP at the Ettalong family medical practice; a reduction in the average age of GPs, from 61 to 58 years; and more practices on the peninsula are now accredited to train registrars, with four GP registrars on the peninsula—that's a 100 per cent increase from March 2017. But the biggest indicator of the success of this working group is the positive feedback I get from residents on the peninsula, who can now see a GP more easily than they have been able to in the past. This is great news for people living on the peninsula. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  Tonight, thousands of Melburnians will gather at Princes Park in Carlton to remember Ms Eurydice Dixon and to reclaim the night. Eurydice was 22 years old. Her friends say she was smart, funny and kind. She was walking home from her comedy show when she sent a text to her friend, 'I'm almost home safe,' but she didn't make it home that night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Walking home alone at night isn't a privilege; it's a right—a right each and every one of us should feel entitled to. Everyone has the right to be safe. Women are not responsible for the decisions of men who attack them. Women have every right to walk safely in our streets and parks. We have every right to be safe in our homes. One woman in Australia dies every week at the hands of a partner or ex-partner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The murder of Eurydice Dixon is devastating and tragic beyond words. I know that many women, like me, are so angry as well as sad about her death—not to mention the outrageous vandalism of her memorial in Melbourne last night. It's time for all of us to harness that anger, to reclaim our streets and parks, to reclaim the night, to be home safe, to not live in fear and to change the culture of violence against women in this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  During the week of 21 May, local volunteer bushfire brigades in the Great Southern region of my electorate responded to a massive 145 callouts—that's their yearly average in just one week. Two of these fires threatened lives and homes in the districts of Napier and Redmond. Together with the Hon. Mike Nahan, I was privileged to share a cuppa with some of the fire control officers: Shane Duncan of South Coast, Kevin Marin of Youngs, Sandy Lyon of King River, Mark Van Dongen of Highway, Brett Smoker of Napier, Pieter Mostert of Redmond, Graeme Poole of Kalgan and Ashley Lynch of the Elleker. I thank all brigade members for their assistance in controlling these fires and preventing the loss of life and property during this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Feedback from the volunteers suggests that changes could be made to improve the operation and safety of our volunteers and the community. In particular, communications infrastructure needs to be able to meet the needs of volunteers on the ground, coordinators and command. I'll be working hard to champion the need for a permanent second repeater channel for Albany, coverage in blackspots and other equipment necessary for emergency situations. Volunteer bushfire fighters are an integral part of regional communities like Albany. I also take this opportunity to thank those who work hard to maintain community safety during these incidents: Department of Fire and Emergency Services incident controller John Tillman; Mayor Dennis Wellington, CEO Andrew Sharpe, Chief Fire Control Officer Darren Prior and all of their staff and team at the City of Albany; St John Ambulance; and all the other agencies involved.</span>

Of course, we are horrified beyond words at the terrible thing that has been done to Eurydice Dixon, but we are horrified beyond words as well that this is part of a continuum of violence against women that we are reading in the papers every day: Qi Yu in New South Wales is missing, presumed dead; an 11-year-old girl was abducted and raped; a two-year-old girl was raped in Tennant Creek. It must stop. Women have the right to walk home at night by themselves and they have the right to be safe in their own homes. One woman every week, on average, loses her life to a current or former partner. One woman in five experiences sexual violence—a figure that's actually increased since 2012 while other forms of violence are decreasing. Today, we think of Eurydice Dixon. We'll be attending a vigil tonight here in Canberra, but we think about all the women who have suffered the threat or the fear of violence and those who haven't survived.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  Liberals believe in a free society, but we also believe in a just one. Intergenerational justice is crucial, because Liberals believe each generation should be free to choose their own future. We don't believe the young should be burdened by a debt of their forebears. We don't believe the young should subsidise those who have accumulated wealth. We don't believe the decisions of today should deny young Australians opportunity tomorrow. That's why we take the national debt seriously, despite the obstruction of the Labor opposition. Today's debt is tomorrow's taxes, and nearly three-quarters of all federal taxes disproportionally hit the pay packets of young Australians, yet an ageing population—the pension, aged care, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and health care at the most expensive time of life—is driving spending up. Our current tax system delivers a wealth transfer from those who haven't had their fair go to those who have.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Taxes should be paid across all stages of life and should not unfairly hurt and hit the young. Taxes should be simple, not complex; they should be consistent, not overtaxing young Australians. And reforms should deliver low, simple and consistent taxes across all stages of life. But that isn't what the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, wants. He wants to narrow the GST meaning we will become more dependent on the taxes young Australians pay. He wants to scrap negative gearing, which will do nothing to increase housing stock; it will only increase rents. He wants to scrap dividend imputation credits, which means more investors will go into the property market. Shifty Shorten's plan will hit young Australians worst. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  I offer the sympathies of this parliament to Eurydice Dixon's family and to all the people who loved her and to the people she loved. We remember that they're not mourning a statistic or a cautionary tale; they're grieving for a person—a funny, smart, clever woman with passions and opinions, friends and family. She wasn't seeking to make a statement that night; she was just living her life. She had her phone with her, now full of 100 unfinished conversations. She was happy that her comedy performance had gone well. She was messaging a friend to check in and let him know that she was nearly home safe. None of that cost her life. Nothing she did or didn't do in any way makes her responsible for what happened. Walking home should not mean that you are risking your life. Getting an Uber, a cab or catching public transport should not be a dangerous ordeal. Women's rights in Australia must include freedom of movement, and that's about more than just better lighting and more CCTV cameras. It's about attitudes, it's about actions, it's about honesty, it's about stopping violence and stopping the enablers of violence, it's about deciding as a nation that violence against women is ultimately preventable, and it's about the example that we set for our sons. Our hearts go out to Eurydice's loved ones today. May she rest in peace.</span>

Since 2010, eight killers and 68 other criminals with shocking records of violence are among foreign born criminals that the AAT has saved from deportation. How can decisions of the Minister for Home Affairs to cancel the visas of rapists, paedophiles, murderers and drug traffickers be overturned by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, even though ministerial delegates argued that the deportations were necessary to protect Australians and that almost all of those they wanted to boot out of the country had substantial criminal records? We want to make sure that we have migrants in our country and welcome them warmly but, if people commit violent crimes against other Australians, they need to understand that the default position is that they will be deported.</span>

The tragic events of recent times in the Northern Territory, and particularly the assault on the young girl at Tennant Creek, are heartbreaking. The protection of children is our most sacred duty. I will ask the Minister for Social Services to go into more detail about precise measures that we're undertaking in the Barclay area, but I want to say that we recognise, as the Chief Minister, Michael Gunner, has said to me, that we're dealing with very dysfunctional families facing enormous challenges of substance abuse. The Chief Minister recognises—as indeed the acting Chief Minister acknowledged quite explicitly—that the Territory government has failed these children. There is a need, as he's acknowledged, to have more senior child protection officers working in the community, who have greater confidence, to intervene earlier. Also, it is vitally important to ensure that people with cultural authority—and particularly speaking about Indigenous communities—are engaged so that the child protection agencies are working with the Aboriginal communities and people with cultural authority to ensure that support is provided both from government and from the community when families are failing their children. I will ask the minister to add to some of the more specific measures that we're adopting.</span>

We are establishing a tripartite commission. That commission will meet in the coming weeks. We are finalising the terms of reference of that tripartite commission with the Northern Territory government. Obviously, we are trying to expedite those terms of reference as quickly as we possibly can.

Ninety per cent of Australians work in the private sector, and more than half of them work in small and medium Australian family-owned businesses. They are the businesses that are investing, encouraged by the reduction in company tax already legislated. They are the companies that are investing and employing. That is why, last year, we had the highest jobs growth in Australia's history. That is why we see GDP growth at 3.1 per cent. We're seeing that strong growth because the government is providing the incentive to encourage Australian businesses to invest and get ahead.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A stronger economy enables the government to have the revenues to provide record funding on health and education and to be able to agree with the states a new five-year public hospital funding deal that will add $30 billion in additional funding—$7.5 billion of which will go to Queensland, where the Labor Party is out there, once again, lying and saying that the government is cutting funding to public hospitals. Every year the funding is going up. Do you know what the greatest risk would be to public hospital funding, the greatest risk to schools and the greatest risk to having life-saving jobs? It would be a Labor government. A Labor government would not be able to manage a stronger economy. It would not be able to deliver the revenues that you need to pay for all of these things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a question of theory or speculation. We know that, in the last Labor government, so poorly were they managing the country's finances, they were reduced to the point where they couldn't put life-saving drugs on to the PBS. They couldn't do it. They were holding them back, and a heavy price was paid. What we're doing is, as those drugs are recommended, we are putting them on the list. We are putting billions of dollars more into public hospitals, into Medicare and into medical research. All of that is possible because of a stronger economy. Without a stronger economy, it is simply not able to be done—and Labor demonstrated that. A stronger economy ensures we can fund the essential services Australians deserve. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Treasury has confirmed that the entire $42 billion stage 3 of the government's Personal Income Tax Plan goes to the top 20 per cent of income earners. How is it fair that, under this government, a banker from Vaucluse earning a million dollars will get a tax cut over $7,000 a year while a hospitality worker from Caboolture will only get a tax cut of $10 a week and will have their penalty rates cut as well?</span>

And then, when the reform is complete, the marginal tax rate will be 32½c, from $41,000 all the way up to $200,000. What does that say to aspiration? What does that say to people who want to get a better job, who want to get a promotion or who want to work some more hours? It means that they will not be paying more and more tax with every extra dollar they earn.</span>

                  </a>  there will be many, many occupations—school principals or police superintendents, which are not normally regarded as being part of the millionaire, banker class of Vaucluse—that will be earning an income that gets up towards that $200,000 mark. What we want to be able to ensure is that for that part of the tax system, the income system, there is every incentive and no disincentive for people to do more, to have a go, to invest, to be ambitious, to aspire and to get ahead. The Labor Party members may seek to dismiss that in the contemptuous way the honourable member opposite did a moment ago. I say: shame on the Labor Party. They used to believe in workers getting ahead. They used to believe in giving people a hand. Nowadays they sound very much like a privileged elite that wants to keep the workers in their place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:12</span>):  I thank the member for Grey for his question because, like all members on this side of the House, we went to the last election and we said to the Australian people, 'We will deliver jobs and we will deliver growth.' Since then, this government has presided over more jobs and more growth. Since the last election, what we've seen is a record year of jobs growth of more than a thousand jobs created every single day on average. We have seen the unemployment rate fall to 5.4 per cent. In particular, we have seen the number of young people getting jobs increase by over 80,000 in the last 12 months. That is the strongest rate of jobs growth for young people since 2008. More young people are getting jobs. More Australians are getting jobs. The reason for that is because businesses are out there investing, making things happen, and they're working under a policy environment that encourages them to do just that. The national accounts have shown that our rate of growth has tipped up over three per cent to put us on top, ahead of all the G7 advanced nations around the world today. We've seen non-mining investment grow by 10 per cent, which is five times the long-run average. That is an economy where businesses are investing, taking advantage of the conditions that are in front of them to go out there and employ more people and give them better opportunities so they can get ahead and get ahead for their own families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national accounts also, affirming that growth, have affirmed the budget. They have validated the budget and the budget outlook because our plan for a stronger economy is working, and that's why we need to stick to the plan. Only by a stronger economy can you deliver and guarantee the essential services, like Medicare and affordable medicines, that the Australian people rely on. That's why Moody's have moved, once again, to affirm the AAA credit rating for Australia. We are one of only 10 countries that have a AAA credit rating from all the three major ratings agencies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked about risks by the member for Grey. The single greatest immediate risk to the Australian economy is the Labor Party, for one simple reason: these characters think putting $200 billion in higher taxes on the Australian economy is somehow to going to help businesses employ people and somehow help people get ahead. They think the economy is something to tax. We think the economy is something to grow, and that's what we are doing on this side of the House with our policies. You can take our policies and our budget to the bank—unlike what the Shadow Treasurer has put forward with his cruel retiree tax and his $10 billion thumping big black hole. He stuffed it up when he announced it, and he stuffed it up when he added it up.</span>

Isn't this what happens when a former investment banker is running the government and a former banker like Brett Whiteley is running in Braddon?</span>

Tasmania is seeing strong economic growth; it's seeing strong jobs growth; it's seeing confidence; it's seeing investment; it's seeing optimism. And do you know why? Because there is a Liberal government in Tasmania and there is a Liberal-National government in Canberra, and what we are doing is encouraging Tasmanian businesses to invest and employ, and they are doing that with a confidence and an optimism that we've not seen in Tasmania for many years. It's a beautiful thing to see.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's good times in Tasmania at the moment, and it's based on the optimism and determination of Tasmanians. One of the important things to do is to be up-front and tell the truth. We know that when you reduce taxes on business you give greater incentives to invest and get ahead, and we know that because every government, Labor and Liberal, has taken that view for years. In fact, the honourable member's leader, the member for Maribyrnong, very eloquently said, standing right here, 'Lower business tax means more investment, higher productivity, more jobs and higher wages.' The member for McMahon went into print, he was so enthusiastic about it. So we know that. That's providing the incentives that we're seeing in Tasmania. But it's important to tell the truth to Tasmanians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition said, on 28 May in Braddon, that the north-west regional hospital has had its funding cut. Let's have a look at that. In Labor's last full year in office, Commonwealth funding for Tasmania's public hospitals was $294 million. This year it's $418 million—an increase of 42 per cent—and that excludes the $730 million payment made to the state government in return for taking back the Mersey Community Hospital. In terms of the new five-year funding deal, Tasmania will receive an increase—an additional $373.6 million over five years from 2020. It's going to receive all of that extra money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what we're doing is: we're providing the incentives, we're providing the encouragement, for Tasmanians to invest and get ahead. And they're seeing that growth, especially in Braddon. Above all, we're showing the integrity to treat Tasmanians with respect, and not mislead them as Labor is doing. We're delivering more funding into public health in Tasmania, and the only reason we can keep doing that is because of the stronger economy supported by our economic plan.</span>

People in Melbourne are grieving at the death of Eurydice Dixon. Melbourne is full of strong, funny women like Eurydice, and this has hit us hard. Thousands of people will be gathering at Princes Park and around the country to remember Eurydice. Many people are in mourning, many are angry and many are both. Prime Minister, do you agree that, whatever we're collectively doing as a country now to change men's behaviour, we need to do more? Will you support increasing efforts to change men's behaviour so that everyone in this country feels safe?</span>

Our hearts go out to Eurydice's family. Our prayers, our sympathy and our love are with them as they grieve her loss. Women must be safe everywhere—on the street, walking through a park, in their homes and at work. We need to ensure that we have a culture of respect for women. Not all disrespect of women ends up in violence against women, but that's where all violence against women begins, and so ensuring that we start from the very start, ensuring that our sons and grandsons respect the women in their lives, is vitally important. We all, as parents and grandparents, have a duty to do that. Also, we have a very profound duty to ensure that our public places, our streets and our parks, are safe places in which to work and walk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that we are all united in this. This is not a partisan issue. When we sit down with states and local government to work through our city plans and City Deals, a key part of that is ensuring that we have an environment that is safe. As my wife, Lucy, often says in her capacity as chief commissioner of the Greater Sydney Commission, a measure of the liveability of a city is whether women are safe to walk wherever, and that has got to be another vital priority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a heartbreaking tragedy, but what we must do, as we grieve, is ensure that we change the hearts of men to respect women. We start with the youngest men, little boys, our sons and grandsons, which makes sure that they respect their mothers and their sisters and all of the women in their lives. As grown men, we must lead by example and treat women with respect. We must ensure that our cities, our towns, our country—everywhere—is safe for every Australian to walk and work, whether it's a park, whether it's a workplace or whether it is in their own home. That is our commitment. I thank the honourable member for the question. I believe, Mr Speaker, that I speak for every honourable member in saying we must never, ever, ever tolerate violence against women. Eurydice Dixon, we mourn her loss, we grieve with her family and we say never again.</span>

As a Melburnian, when we heard the news that this dreadful murder had happened at Princes Park, I felt the same shock that millions of other people felt, as one who is familiar with this park. My own boy has trained around the very oval where they found Eurydice. It is shocking. It is futile. It was beyond belief. Not again, I thought; not again has a woman been killed in Melbourne—or anywhere in Australia, to that end. Women in Australia have the right to freedom of movement. It is not the fault of women if they choose to walk home from transport to their house. All of this violence is ultimately preventable. We need to tackle the enablers of violence, we need to change the attitudes of men and we should commit ourselves here that nothing is off limits to prevent violence against women or, indeed, any Australian.</span>

Of course, of most concern to Australians is the very regressive, damaging and lifestyle-destroying retiree tax, which will take money out of the pockets of pensioners and some of the most vulnerable retirees in this country—around 8,500 of them in the electorate of Chisholm and around 3,500 in the electorate of Braddon, which I was visiting only the other day. Many of them are older, retired Australians who have scrimped hard and worked hard all of their lives and have paid their taxes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />In fact, when I was in Braddon just the other week, I heard directly from those retirees who stand to lose huge chunks of their retirement income thanks to the Labor Party's shameless tax grab. These are not multimillionaires, as the Leader of the Opposition may claim. In fact, they're not on high incomes at all. They are overwhelmingly on very modest incomes, just trying to enjoy their retirement. These are the people that Justine Keay, the Leader of the Opposition and Labor are turning their backs on. These are the people that Brett Whiteley and Julia Banks and everybody on this side of the coalition are working so hard to protect. Shockingly, and despite the backflips and the protests from those opposite, many pensioners and many retirees—some of the most vulnerable in our community—will be impacted. The Leader of the Opposition, despite all of his promises, cannot be trusted. The Australian people know better. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Under the Labor Party's proposal on tax, a public school teacher in Victoria would pay between $800 and $1,200 more tax every year. A crane operator would pay between $900 and $1,600 more tax every year. A public school psychologist in New South Wales would pay between $2,300 and $2,800 more tax every year. A forklift driver would pay between $3,800 and $4,500 more tax every year. Coming to Adelaide, a police inspector would pay between $4,000 and $5,200 more tax every year. The Labor Party is led by a man who once proposed a 30 per cent top rate of income tax. Of course, that's the same man who proposed a 25 per cent rate of company tax, as did his offsider, the shadow Treasurer. What we have with our comprehensive tax plan is one that is fair and encourages investment, encourages enterprise and encourages aspiration, and it is highly progressive.</span>

                  </a>  The honourable member laughs. Well, the honourable member should be aware that, when the plan is fully rolled out in 2024-25, people in the top tax bracket, paying the highest rate of marginal tax, will be paying a larger share of the personal income tax take than they are today, and they will be paying more of that income tax share than they are today. And the person on $200,000 will be paying more than 12½ times more income tax than the person on $41,000. The income tax scheme, the whole structure, remains progressive. The bulk of the tax is paid by people on higher incomes, but what we're doing is encouraging aspiration, enterprise, and people getting ahead, including people working in hospitality, working on lower incomes, because they too want to get ahead and earn big money, like the members of the Labor Party opposite.</span>

The Liberal and National parties are for lower taxes. That's what we're for: we're for lower taxes. We're for lower personal taxes; we're for lower business taxes. We believe that you should not suffocate the economy with higher taxes. We believe that we should be providing that tax relief to all working Australians—not just some, but those on lower and middle income and all Australians out there working—because we believe all Australians work hard and we believe they all deserve tax relief. And we believe businesses should have competitive tax rates. We do not believe that businesses should be shackled to the second-highest tax rates in the world when they're out there trying to invest and employ people and grow their businesses and get the return back on the big investments they've made in their businesses, putting their own houses and their own livelihoods on the line to ensure that other people can have jobs and enjoy the prosperity that is achievable in this country. That is our plan. That's part of our strong plan, our plan for a stronger economy, because we understand that you cannot guarantee the essential services Australians rely on unless you have a stronger economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party wants to put more than $200 billion of additional taxes on the Australian economy. That's why Australians cannot afford Labor. They cannot afford a Labor government that would put on more than $200 billion in additional taxes. The way Australians will pay for that is not just in the higher taxes that they'll pay but in the threat to the services that they rely on. If we're looking at Tasmania and infrastructure, the $60 million for the Bass Highway comes from a stronger economy. That's where that comes from. The $1½ billion for boosting the Bruce Highway, up near the member for Petrie and in the Longman electorate, comes from a stronger economy. The $10 million for the chemotherapy treatment unit in Caboolture Hospital comes from a government that understands why a stronger economy is important to guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our personal tax plan is responsible, it's comprehensive and it deals with real problems in the tax system to ensure that 94 per cent of Australians will not face a marginal tax rate higher than 32½c in the dollar. That's a real plan and that's what we're delivering. Our enterprise tax plan will ensure that the businesses that currently employ more than one in two Australians will be joined by all businesses in having competitive tax rates so they can employ more Australians. It's under this government since we were first elected that a million jobs have been created. It's under this government that we've seen unemployment coming down. It's under this government that we've seen 80,000 young people get a job. Jobs and growth: that's what we've delivered; that's what we'll continue to deliver.</span>

Can the Prime Minister confirm that, by the time they are fully implemented, stage 3 of the government's personal income tax scheme and its big business tax cut will cost the budget at least $25 billion a year? Why won't the Prime Minister support Labor's plan for a bigger, better tax cut for 10 million Australians who earn less than $125,000, instead of giving $25 billion a year to big business and high-income earners?</span>

I'll tell you when it's unaffordable: it's unaffordable when you're uncompetitive. It's unaffordable to have a company tax rate in Australia that is at the top of the OECD. The honourable member wrote a book and talked about the importance of having a competitive tax rate. Now, having done that, he's been forced to eat his words, and he's flinging himself in the way of a competitive tax rate. I'll ask the Treasurer to add to my answer.</span>

I wouldn't be relying on the shadow Treasurer's figures anyway, anywhere, anytime. This is a shadow Treasurer who came up with this genius of a plan to hit pensioners, retirees, all of these, and strip away their tax refund. He announced it with great fanfare and he said, 'We'll raise $59 billion, and I won't change a jot of it.' Then, within two weeks, he was tripping over himself to come out with amendments to his own policy. Then we find out that he says it will cost 55.7. So we took his entire policy that he announced to the Australian people and we asked Treasury to cost that policy, and it comes in at a revenue of $10 billion less than he said. And he's saying: 'Trust us. Trust Labor with money. We always get it right.' Well, I'm looking over there—I can't see him today, the member for Lilley; he must be otherwise engaged today!</span>

The May figures for jobs, for example, show that the government is on track to create and support 1,031,000 jobs since we were elected in September 2013—in fact, seeing unemployment drop down to 5.4 per cent. We promised in 2013 that we'd create a million jobs in the first two terms of a coalition government. We've actually achieved that about seven or eight months ahead of schedule because of the policies of this government driving jobs and growth. We've reduced unemployment and we've increased the number of jobs, so all of those people are working, paying taxes, being full members of our economy and our society. In fact, the national accounts also showed recently that growth for the last quarter was at one per cent, 3.1 per cent for the year, so we are actually not just promising jobs and growth but we are delivering jobs and growth as we said we would. The Australian economy's now back on track after six years of listless government under the previous Labor administration, and the public are clearly getting the benefits of that through higher wages and by paying less tax under this government.</span>

The Leader of the Opposition in particular cannot be trusted; nor can the public afford a Labor government. Their policy is, as the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services outlined earlier in question time, $200 billion worth of new taxes hitting everybody across the board. Their latest target, of course, is retirees and pensioners, the most vulnerable income earners in the economy. They are on fixed incomes. They've arranged their affairs to be able to take care of themselves. They have worked hard their whole lives and helped build this country, yet pensioners and retirees are the target of this vicious Leader of the Opposition and Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk to the voters in our electorates when we go back, and they are quite worried. Why should they be made to be frightened at this stage of their lives? Ironically, those people who can afford to change their affairs will not be hit by the Leader of the Opposition's policy. Ironically, he has tried to start a class war when the people who will be most hurt will be people on low incomes and pensioners who cannot rearrange their affairs. He can't even rearrange a class war. So those who can afford to rearrange their affairs will do so and those on the lowest incomes will be hurt under this Leader of the Opposition.</span>

We all remember Dr Craig Emerson, who used to talk a great deal about effective marginal tax rates and all of the problems occasioned by that. We're very well aware of those issues. The member for Fenner has written about them. This gives you a 32.5c marginal tax rate from $41,000 to $200,000. It ensures you have every incentive for people to get ahead.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The approach that we're taking is one that provides benefits to Australians right in the heart of that middle-income area, where Australians have had so many disincentives from bracket creep. It is a very positive reform and, as far as the issues about inequality are concerned, I come back to this point: after the plan is fully rolled out, the people on the 45c marginal tax bracket—that is, those earning over $200,000—will be paying a larger share of the personal income tax than they do today. A person on $200,000, who is earning roughly five times as much as somebody on $41,000, will be paying nearly 13 times as much tax. That is a progressive tax system.</span>

That's important to point out because, in by-elections around the country at the moment, we see Labor candidates pretending to support the government's position on border protection when really they don't. And there's no better example than Susan Lamb, the Labor candidate in the Longman seat in Queensland, who does not support our border protection policies.</span>

The Labor Party would undo each of the successful pillars of Operation Sovereign Borders, which has seen children no longer drowning at sea and no longer in detention. We've closed those 17 detention centres, and Susan Lamb and others should at least today start to be honest with the people of Longman that the Labor Party is promising a policy where boats will restart and kids will be back in detention. That is the reality of what Labor is promising at the moment.</span>

They know that Trevor Ruthenberg is the only candidate in the Longman by-election that stands for strong border protection.</span>

The 2016 Tasmanian floods devastated many Tasmanian communities, including the township of Latrobe. Therefore, instead of continuing with his arrogant and out-of-touch policy to give $80 billion tax giveaways to the big end of town, when will the Prime Minister adopt Labor's plan to invest $3.4 million to fund flood mitigation works in and around Latrobe to protect every single house and business in the township from future catastrophic floods?</span>

He's not in government, and he won't be in government after the by-election.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the 2016 floods, the Hodgman government and the Turnbull government worked together through our Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements to deal with what was a devastating and tragic set of floods. The response included category C funding of up to $10,000 for severely affected primary producers. We know how to deal with those problems on this side of the House. In nine local government areas, including in Latrobe, there was a total of $6.6 million of funding. It also included category D funding for $16 million worth of projects, including a $3 million flood-mapping project for all affected local government areas.</span>

That's why we took the view some time ago that we needed a framework for disaster resilience to be revised and updated. In April 2018 we formed a national task force within the Department of Home Affairs to tackle exactly this issue. We are proud of providing assistance to communities impacted by disasters. Our government respects the processes of the Latrobe Council, which will be dealing with this issue this week, and we look forward to working with them to protect the region from future floods.</span>

It's helping to deliver those regional services and connect communities like never before. These are essential services, such as the ability to make a phone call or use the internet; safer and better roads on which to drive, getting you home sooner and safer; reliable water infrastructure; jobs for families and young people in the regions and in the seat of Murray; and opportunities for those who want to get ahead, building our future.</span>

Just last week the Minister for Regional Communications, Senator Bridget McKenzie, announced $25 million for yet another round of the Mobile Black Spot Program. This builds on the success of the Mobile Black Spot Program to date, which is on track to deliver 867 base stations nationwide by June next year.

Let me tell you now, it's $60 million, but we're investing $400 million. That's what the Liberals and Nationals are doing. That's why we're delivering for the people of Victoria, the people of Tasmania and regional Australians. Regional Australians know it, but they're onto this shifty Leader of the Opposition.

They played the most expensive team in the world, France, and they came so close. I won't express any personal views about the video referee, but I think a fair-minded fan of the French team would recognise they were very fortunate to get that one-goal win, and we know that the Socceroos played so well. We congratulate them. I thank the honourable member for giving me the opportunity to do so here in the House of Representatives. We wish them all the best for the next game against Denmark and for the whole campaign.</span>

He, obviously, acknowledges they've had some real problems with streaming from the Optus platform. He believes he can fix it. He believes it will be fixed tonight, and, obviously, Australian soccer fans will be expecting Optus to deliver in that regard. Thank you very much again for asking the question. Go, the Socceroos!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:57</span>):  I want to thank the member for Bonner, who comes to this place as somebody who achieved great things as a small-business person. He is a restauranteur, specialising in Italian food. I'd recommend the marinara! What he knows from his time both as a small-business person and in this House is you can't grow either a small business or an economy without a plan, without the ability to ensure that you are living within your means. And what he saw in his work and what we see in this government and in this economy right now is record growth because of the plan in jobs. And that record growth, that million jobs, allows us to invest in essential services, such as record funding for Medicare, with an extra $4.8 billion at the recent budget; record funding in mental health, with an extra $338 million; record funding for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, with major new drugs for breast cancer and spinal muscular atrophy being listed, as opposed to Labor's practice of failing to list drugs; and record funding for hospitals.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things which I was able to see last week when I visited Caboolture in the seat of Longman and met with Trevor Ruthenberg—our extraordinary candidate, who's spent time in the Air Force, in the private sector and in the not-for-profit sector—was that he saw that the No. 1 health priority for the area was investing in drug and alcohol support services. That's why we invested $11 million, not to begin in one year, two years, three years, four years or five years but to begin immediately investing in drug and alcohol support for the people of Caboolture. In Caboolture and in the surrounding areas, ice was recognised by the Primary Health Network as the No. 1 task for assessing, dealing with and addressing going forwards. So we have responded, not just to the Primary Health Network, not just to the people of Caboolture but also to the advocacy of Trevor Ruthenberg—better known to the locals as 'Big Trev'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This plan, Big Trev's big plan, for a better Caboolture is all about ensuring that we have drug and alcohol and ice support on the ground. And it's not waiting one, two, three or four years like Labor; it is dealing with the problem right now—immediately—with better support, detox facilities, demand facilities, day rehab and overnight facilities for the people of Caboolture.</span>

The facts are very straightforward. The SBS receives around $280 million in funding every year from the government. How SBS decides to use this funding is a matter for the board and management of SBS—a fairly basic principle of governance.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to make the point that, in exchange for sharing the World Cup rights, SBS secured some rights to the English Premier League matches over a three-year period—2016-17 to 2018-19. In other words, the board and management of SBS made a commercial decision. On this side of the House, we think they are best placed to make those decisions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:03</span>):  I thank the member for Fisher for his question. Firstly, commiserations to the member for Port Adelaide—losing to the member for Lilley really is an insult! The member for Fisher knows there is a real difference between the energy policy of the Labor Party and the energy policy of the coalition. Under the Labor Party, your power prices will go up. The Labor Party is the party of blackouts and the party of reckless renewable energy targets. Under the coalition, you'll always pay less for your power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just look at the Labor Party's record. When they were last in office, power prices doubled. Each and every year, when the Labor Party were last in office, power prices went up. We had the $15 billion dreaded carbon tax. We had the cash for clunkers. We had the pink batts. We had the citizens' assembly. Labor ignored the warnings in their own energy white paper about what it would mean for domestic gas prices to export more from the east coast of Australia—and they gave a green light to the gold plating of the poles and wires, something we are still paying for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the coalition abolished the carbon tax, and we saw the single biggest drop in power prices ever recorded. We've stopped the networks gaming the system. If the Labor Party had done it, we would have saved $6½ billion for consumers. We've ensured more gas is available for domestic customers before it's exported overseas. We're getting a better deal from the retailers for millions of Australian customers, and the National Energy Guarantee, which has the support of the big energy users—the BlueScopes, the BHPs, the Rio Tintos, the irrigators, the National Farmers' Federation and others—will, for the first time, integrate energy and climate policy, reduce power prices and create a more reliable system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last fortnight the big three have reduced their power prices across New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia. This is something we never saw from the Labor Party. Under the Labor Party, power prices went up each and every year. If you're an EnergyAustralia customer in Brisbane with a small business—a cafe or a hairdresser—you will save around $470 a year. If you're a household in Brisbane with EnergyAustralia, you'll save just under $100 a year. So come these by-elections in Braddon, Mayo and Longman, the choice is clear: only the coalition will deliver a more affordable and reliable power system.</span>

The honourable members opposite should recognise the world is getting more competitive than ever and that what we need to do is ensure that every element of our tax system ensures that Australian businesses can compete and win. The member for McMahon set that all out in his famous book years ago. He's munching his way through one copy of it after another. He's being forced to eat his words. Talk about dry economics—it's very dry to have to be munching away through all those books! The fact of the matter is that a more competitive corporate sector results in more investment, more jobs. That's why we're seeing record jobs growth. The Labor Party should recover the economic good sense they had in years past and support our enterprise tax plan.</span>

He is a great champion of infrastructure. He's a great deliverer of infrastructure. He delivered the Redcliffe Peninsula line, and I well remember being there with the member at the happy opening of that impressive facility. He's a very successful and experienced businessman, and he knows that you need a plan; you need to know how to deliver.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He's also part of LNP team Queensland, which is delivering extraordinary infrastructure outcomes for the people of Queensland. There will be $15.5 billion between 2013-14 and 2021-22. There will be $880 million for Pine River to Caloundra, including the Dohles Rocks Road interchange, which will benefit and respond to the advocacy of the member for Petrie and the member for Dixon. It is a terrific outcome. It will also benefit the electorate of Longman. There will be $800 million for Cooroy to Curra, section D, responding to the advocacy of the member for Wide Bay. There will be $390 million for Beerburrum to Nambour, responding to the advocacy of the members for Fisher and Fairfax. Of course, it will also benefit the electorate of Longman. There will be $300 million for Brisbane Metro, responding to the advocacy of the member for Brisbane.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is LNP team Queensland delivering outcomes for the people of Queensland. The members of team Queensland know that you need to have a plan. They know that you need a strong economy to be able to afford these projects. So, if the people of Longman would like to have more infrastructure projects, they would be well advised to choose yet another member to join the LNP's team Queensland. Of course, they could go for yet another union official. They might think the chamber is a bit short of union officials, so they might choose to have another one. But what they might decide, based upon the evidence, is that it is the LNP's team Queensland that is delivering unprecedented infrastructure outcomes for Queensland. If you want the big infrastructure, my advice is to call for Big Trev.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HASTIE:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—I am pleased to present the committee's report for its review of the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister introduced the bill into the House on 7 December 2017 and referred it to the committee for inquiry and report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill repeals existing criminal offences and introduces a range of new offences into the Criminal Code in relation to espionage, foreign interference, theft of trade secrets, sabotage of public infrastructure, and secrecy of Commonwealth information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also amends a range of existing offences, including those in relation to treason, treachery, and other threats to security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The significant and unprecedented new measures in the bill required careful consideration, and the committee was pleased to undertake the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During its inquiry, the committee received compelling evidence that Australia is facing an unprecedented threat from espionage and foreign interference, and that current laws are not adequate to deal with this threat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Director-General of Security, in strongly supporting the bill, advised the committee that, 'the current criminal offences are inadequate to deal with the foreign intelligence threat that we now face' and described existing offences as 'outdated and deficient' and 'inadequate or unworkable'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result, ASIO assessed that the 'net effect is that our nation's freedom of decision-making and core interests are not adequately protected by the rule of law'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unchecked, espionage has the potential to significantly reduce Australia's long-term security, and foreign interference could undermine our democracy and threaten the rights and freedoms of our people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Economic espionage also has the potential to substantially diminish Australia's economic wellbeing and international competitiveness. At stake is our sovereignty, security and prosperity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has therefore accepted that there is a pressing need to strengthen and modernise current espionage and foreign interference laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conducting its review, the committee received 51 written submissions and 20 supplementary submissions from a range of organisations and individuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee held five public and two private hearings, and received two classified briefings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many participants in the inquiry supported strengthened measures to deal with the threat posed by increased espionage and foreign interference activities in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Submitters also called for caution to ensure that innocuous or beneficial conduct is not caught up in the proposed new offences, and that sections of the Australian community are not adversely affected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee considers that laws need to be effective at achieving their stated aims, at the same time as minimising any limitations on the personal liberty of Australians and a flourishing civil society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Taking into account evidence received from participants in the inquiry, the committee has made a range of recommendations aimed at ensuring the bill is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">clear and unambiguous in its terms,</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">proportional and appropriately targeted to the threat, and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">enforceable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has made 60 recommendations in total—the most important being that the bill be passed through both the House and the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 5 March 2018, the Attorney-General provided the committee with a number of proposed government amendments, primarily to narrow the scope of the secrecy offences in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These proposed amendments have been taken into account—and supported—by the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following implementation of the recommendations in the report, the committee has recommended that the bill be passed. I'd like to personally thank the opposition members of the PJCIS, particularly the deputy chair, the member for Holt, and also the member for Isaacs, who worked in the national interest to deliver a bipartisan report. When we have such strong collaboration, it makes the passage of these bills all the more sweeter, so I acknowledge the work that they did on the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (No. 1) 2018 was introduced on 24 May this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In reviewing the bill, the committee considered the proposed amendments to be consistent with recommendations made by the committee earlier this year following its review of police stop, search and seizure powers, the control order regime, the preventative detention order regime and the declared area provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee welcomed the acceptance of its recommendations that the counterterrorism powers be extended by a further three years, with reviews by this committee prior to the new sunset date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These future reviews will be an opportunity to examine the impact of amendments to the control order regime and declared area provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They will also provide an opportunity to assess the efficacy of the regimes and, accordingly, the continued need for these powers in the context of the security environment at that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee noted that, while the bill implements one recommendation from the committee's report into ASIO's questioning and detention powers, the remainder of that report—including the committee's recommendation for repeal of the questioning and detention warrant power—is still being considered by the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee supports the amendments as proposed and recommends that the bill be passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend both reports to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWG" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  by leave—I thank the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for those short statements in tabling the committee's report on the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 and also the committee's report on a range of powers—namely, the control order power; the declared areas power; the stop, search and seizure power; and the preventative detention order power—which is the subject of the <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2018; </span>that is the title of the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two matters I wish to draw to the attention of the House. The first is that, in relation to this second bill, the government has accepted the recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which is that these extraordinary powers—the control order power; the declared areas power; the stop, search and seizure power; and the preventative detention order power—should all be treated as just that: extraordinary powers that should not be regarded as at any point going permanently into the Australian statute book. To that end, the committee recommended that a further sunset period of three years be extended to them. The government has accepted that recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's one other matter of particular significance in this bill, which the committee has commented on and the chair has already mentioned in his remarks, and that is that two other powers, which are only peripherally the subject of this bill—namely, the questioning and detention warrant power and the questioning warrant power—are to be extended for one year. That's because the government has yet to respond in a formal sense to the committee's separate report on the questioning and detention warrant power and the questioning warrant power. That report recommended that the questioning and detention warrant power be repealed and that the questioning warrant power be retained but substantially amended. While it is considering its response to that report the government has decided that, because both those provisions sunset in September this year, it's appropriate that they be extended for a period of one year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that, as has been noted, this recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for repeal of the questioning and detention warrant power marks the first time since 2002, when this parliament legislated a whole range of extraordinary powers being given to our police and our security agencies, that a power would be repealed. As the committee has noted, because this bill does not provide a complete response, the committee and this parliament are awaiting the government's response to that recommendation. I have every confidence that the government will accept the recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for repeal, for the first time, of an extraordinary power granted to, in this case, ASIO. It's a recommendation that follows an identical recommendation made by two reports of two separate independent national security legislation monitors. I thank the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUCHHOLZ</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:23</span>):  It is poignant that I stand to give a speech on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 2) Bill of 2018. Before I address the six different schedules to the bill in more granular detail, there are a couple of points I want to make. Firstly, I used to make the mistake of thinking that veterans are elderly men or women who are proudly paraded through the streets of this nation's capital and provincial cities in Jeeps on Anzac Day. But I am now becoming more and more familiar with veterans under the age of 30 who have returned from conflict, for whom, of course, these provisions are also made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I'd like to just quickly address is some of the amazing work that's being done by some of my innovative RSL groups throughout the electorate of Wright. There is no more poignant an example than that of Errol Guilfoyle, President of the Beaudesert RSL, and his advocacy team, who are discovering new ways to stretch the counselling services of the RSL more widely to communities throughout the electorate. The RSL have shown entrepreneurial flair. They've actually put together a caravan, which they take on the road, that they use for fundraisers and as an outreach office, which works in conjunction and over the top of the six schedules that I will speak to in more granular detail. Steve Monteath is the vice-president, and was at the helm of the design and construction of the caravan, which is pulled around the region and has been on display. David Kassulke from AJ Bush was the manufacturer. David does an enormous amount of work for the community. He's a member of the chamber of commerce in our community, and he had Mark King from his workforce take point on construction. I can assure you that, if there are any other RSL organisations around the country looking to replicate this amazing work so that outreach can be undertaken, AJ Bush in Beaudesert would happily roll out another 100 or 200 of these caravans to be used for exactly the same purpose—supporting our veterans community. Tony Paddock did an amazing job in branding it in the RSL colours, and Dr Robbie Maher contributed to it. The federal government kicked in $21,000 for that initiative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government continues to honour its strong commitment to veterans and the veterans community by extending a range of services to veterans and their families—to give them the support that they not only need but deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 2) Bill contains six schedules, all important schedules which support our veterans and their existing families. Schedule 1 is all about the removal of barriers to the rehabilitation of veterans who suffer as a result of service related physical and mental health conditions. These measures will provide former members of the Australian Defence Force with incapacity payments at 100 per cent of their normal weekly earnings when they are studying, as opposed to the current rate, which is 75 per cent. I don't think anyone would begrudge someone that, when they were either learning or earning, trying to rehabilitate and re-enter the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 is all about preventing veteran suicide and improving the mental health services available for veterans. For veterans who have been discharged from hospital following an attempted suicide or suicide crisis, or who may be at risk of suicide because of mental health issues, this measure will provide services to support veterans' mental health, including access to government and non-government treatment, and services that will help reduce the risk of suicide and enhance their quality of life. The mental health integrity that we as a government are focused on is a sleeping giant in the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 supports veterans' families by giving partners more time to choose whether to receive compensation payments resulting from their partner's death as a weekly payment, a lump sum or a mixture of both. It's all about flexibility for families in a difficult time, empowering them to decide how they'd like to receive their compensation, if, regretfully, that ever happens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 is another measure which supports veterans' families, by extending eligibility for the Long Tan Bursary scheme to the grandchildren of any Australian Vietnam veteran. This enables grandchildren of veterans to access the bursary to undertake post-secondary education, and it is an important recognition of the contribution that Vietnam veterans have made to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 rightly recognises serving on special submarine operations between 1 January 1978 and 31 December 1992 as operational service. This will ensure the classified nature of special operations does not hinder access by those veterans to benefit entitlements available to those with operational service. That has always been a contentious point, and I'm glad to see that was introduced as a schedule to give relief to those submarine men and women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 6—too often veterans struggle to wade through the masses of paperwork to make claims for compensation. Presently, the claim must be made in writing, distinct from a claim of liability. This measure will enable veterans seeking compensation under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 to lodge a claim for compensation orally. The amendments will mean a veteran will be asked during a needs-assessment telephone call whether they want to make a claim for compensation, and their oral statement will be treated as a valid claim under the act, making it easier for veterans to engage with the department.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This compensation bill demonstrates that the government has listened to the concerns and frustrations of veterans and their families. We are committed to putting them first and at the centre of the decisions we make, not only as a government but from both sides of the House. Veterans have given so much to this country. They have fought and served to protect our great nation, our freedoms and our way of life. That's why this government is strongly supporting veterans not only in my electorate of Wright but right across the entire nation, extending real support to veterans and their families, giving them the services that they need and deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to close my commentary by again offering an accolade to the RSL in Beaudesert, where we have an advocacy officer, Tom—I won't share his last name—who's 25 and a returned serviceman himself. In communications with him recently, I asked him what his initial challenges were. He said that returned veterans of his age group that are returning from active service in operational theatres around the world find that there's a disconnect between the younger generation and the RSLs, who, for all intents and purposes, are perceived as a more ageing population. They find it hard to connect. Tom is doing an amazing job, building those personal relationships, because he has just come back from modern warfare. He understands the equipment that they're using. He has been trained and has just returned from an environment where he may know some of the chains of command, some of the personalities. The entrepreneurial trailer which allows the RSL to have even wider outreach for advocacy is a vehicle that will assist Tom in reaching those modern veterans who don't believe the RSL is a place that they can land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I assure all Australians that this government and those on the other side of the House put our hands on our hearts, and we do try to provide an environment so that no-one is left behind. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="245392" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:33</span>):  I welcome a veteran-centric approach. It makes sense, of course: you focus on veterans when you're trying to help them. The more the focus is on veterans and their families and their needs, the better. Our shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Kingston, has already given a comprehensive statement of Labor's position in relation to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 2) Bill 2018 and our support for its provisions. For the record, I happen to think the member for Kingston is doing an outstanding job, advocating for veterans and their families, and I commend her for it. Recently, she came to Darwin and attended a forum which I convened for the veterans in my electorate. She heard their concerns and answered their questions. Solomon has well over 2,000 veterans. One of my most important objectives as the member for Solomon is to ensure that the people who have served our country receive the support and assistance they need, particularly as they transition into civilian life and build their lives after service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill contains six schedules. They are all important, and we support them, but I wish to speak particularly today about the first two, which relate to education and employment, and to suicide prevention. Education and employment are crucial for veterans transitioning into civilian life, particularly for those who have had to leave the ADF because of injury or incapacity. Unemployment is a critical issue for veterans that are leaving the service. It can lead to financial hardship, depression, mental illness, family breakdown and homelessness. We know that about 30 per cent of those leaving the ADF fail to find a job. For those who do, it is often below their capabilities and at a pay level significantly below what they were earning in the Australian Defence Force. But of course it's not just about the money, as important as that is; it's about purpose, about having meaningful employment—a worthwhile job that also provides a routine and structure to life. The social connections that come with employment can go some way towards replacing those previously provided by military life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that Labor has committed to a $121 million veterans' employment program, which will assist veterans to move into meaningful employment and assist employers to hire prospective workers with highly transferable skills. Talking to my dad, a Vietnam veteran, and his mates, I think the best thing that can be done, if possible, is to come out of the military into employment. The transition from military life to education can also be challenging. In this regard, I commend the work of the Australian Student Veterans Association, ASVA, which helps veterans overcome these challenges by establishing chapters in universities throughout Australia to provide a peer network for veterans on campuses. These chapters can link veterans with like-minded students who have also served, to give veterans some sense of that camaraderie in the ADF and so they can assist each other, because that transition process can be pretty tough. I want to acknowledge in particular someone who's had to transfer out of the forces due to injury—that is, Matty Wyatt-Smith, the national manager of strategic engagement with ASVA. I also acknowledge our own Hannah Taino-Spick, from Palmerston, who is doing wonderful work with ASVA in my electorate, in particular with Charles Darwin University.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 creates a new suicide prevention pilot. This trial program will build on the coordinated approach used in the two previous trials, providing intensive services to ensure veterans receive support when they leave hospital with access to relevant government and non-government treatment and services. I want to in particular recognise the great work of the member for Herbert, Cathy O'Toole, in her advocacy for establishing the first suicide prevention trial in Townsville. The second trial created the coordinated veterans' care pilot, aimed at providing mental health support for veterans in rural and regional areas. There is a great and real need for a similar service to be based in my electorate in Darwin. I urge the minister and the department to consider establishing a specialised mental health and suicide prevention unit to service our more than 2,000 veterans in Darwin, Palmerston and the surrounding rural areas in partnership, of course, with the Northern Territory government. As an ex-service person, I have known many men and women directly affected by the tragedy of suicide. I hope the reforms in this bill will go a long way to avert such personal tragedies into the future. I fully support this trial and the others currently underway. I look forward to seeing the results that come out of them. I sincerely hope for the trial's success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to quickly touch on an issue that has affected many veterans—mefloquine. It is a current issue that has been raised with me a number of times by veterans and it goes to the ex-service personnel involved in anti-malarial trials using the mefloquine family of drugs. I again acknowledge the work of the member for Herbert, Cathy O'Toole; she's a great advocate for the veterans in Townsville and in her electorate. Dr Mike Kelly, the member for Eden-Monaro and a former Army officer, has also spoken about the effects that these experimental drug programs, these trials, had. He has also joined the calls for an urgent inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of these trials took place as part of INTERFET, which went into Timor-Leste almost 20 years ago now, but the trials also involved ADF personnel deployed to Bougainville. The then Minister for Veterans' Affairs—and we've had quite a few, but at that time it was Mr Tehan—told these veterans he would set up a dedicated mefloquine support team to assist with mefloquine-related claims. Unfortunately, he didn't do that, and we found out through Senate estimates that there is no dedicated team and that a few DVA staff deal with mefloquine inquiries along with their other duties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge that the shadow minister has led the way and has joined with the new minister, who is with us here in the chamber, who now has the opportunity to right this wrong, to do the right thing and to set up a full inquiry into the mefloquine anti-malarial trials and some of the disability claims resulting from them. The minister, I know, understands that it's his duty to address this issue and to do the right things by the veterans and their families who may have been harmed during these trials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to now move to the concept of a one-stop shop. To go back in history a little bit: since the end of the First World War, we have, as a nation, recognised that we have a responsibility to care for our returned service personnel. Arguably our greatest military commander, John Monash, saw it as his duty to ensure that we commemorated the sacrifices of those who died in the service of our country and to support those who returned. In the past 100 years, this sense of national obligation has led to a complex system of government and non-government organisations intended to support veterans and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill presently before us is an example of our efforts to meet the changing needs of veterans and their families, and in recent years there has been a growing and welcome awareness of the problems and challenges faced by our serving personnel as they return from overseas armed conflicts and as they leave active service. This awareness has been mainly focused on health and wellbeing, with particular concern about what we now understand to be post-traumatic stress disorder, severe depression and suicide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But one consequence of the proliferation of organisations and services intended to aid veterans is that, in the words of the National Mental Health Commission Review 2017, it may be 'leading to results that are not necessarily in the interests of former service members'. My friend Colonel Andrew Hocking CSC, in a private capacity has put forward some very thoughtful suggestions about how we can simplify and improve the process of provision of services to veterans. He writes that there are now:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… an estimated 2,780 ex-service organization locations now established across Australia and a further 3,474 charities with veterans nominated as their beneficiaries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the growth in veteran support has generally been positive, with more choice of service providers, greater geographical access and more responsive support, there is now a need to serve cross-sector veteran and family needs, and a need to review the effective functioning of the whole system. He says that it would be counterproductive to invest more in individual organisations and programs without investment in the functioning of the overall system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He has made a suggestion which I strongly support: the establishment of one-stop shops for veterans and their families. He points out that, at present, veterans and their families are largely left to fulfil the function of cross-sector coordination themselves. He writes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Prior to attempting any self-coordination, veterans struggle to understand what cross-sector services are available to them. Veterans are expected to conduct their own research, develop a degree of knowledge and expertise of the services available, and then individually apply to each service provider. This is stressful and in some circumstances overwhelming. For this reason, there is a compelling argument that the veteran support system should be optimised for the ease of interaction by veterans and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The one-stop shops would aim to develop networks and a thorough expertise of community, state, federal and cross sector services available in a particular region, and then to develop mechanisms that assist veterans and their families to coordinate their access to these services. Whilst the human nature of supporting veterans and their families warrants the establishment of physical one-stop shops, the development of virtual tools is likely to be of benefit.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Consideration could be given to reviewing the extant facilities and resources resident in individual organisations (including RSL, DVA, ESOs but also other federal/state/community social service hubs), with the aim of collaboratively pooling these facilities and resources to achieve the functions described above. A one-stop shop would not only ease the burden on veterans and their families but allow for effective evaluation of the services available. This further serves a dual purpose of highlighting duplication of services and reducing costs and overheads for individual organisations, resulting in a more efficient and effective use of available whole of nation resources.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I would like to confirm Labor's support for the measures contained in this bill. I commend the government for bringing them forward in legislative form. However, as the minister is well aware, there's more to be done. The Mefloquine issue is an instance where the government has failed our veterans and their families. The whole system of services and support for veterans, whilst well-meaning, is fragmented, complex and confusing. In my electorate we need a one-stop shop where veterans and their families can go to seek guidance, advice and practical help. That's what I'm committed to. I'm committed to supporting those who have served our country and have served our community.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:46</span>):  It's a pleasure to follow the member for Solomon in this debate. I'm very pleased to stand to contribute to the debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 2) Bill 2018. This bill comprises a number of important measures that will provide greater support and assistance to veterans and the people they love. Labor supports this legislation. I want to make that very clear at the outset. We know that the men and women who have given so much to protect our country deserve every opportunity to build healthy, productive lives after they leave the defence services. Veterans have sacrificed so much already for all of us, and as a country we absolutely have an obligation to provide the support and assistance necessary when they return to civilian life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a personal issue for me. I'm very happy to declare that interest up-front. I'm the daughter of a Vietnam veteran. I have lived through all of those cycles: a life of service, a life of adjusting into civilian life and a life around families readjusting and learning to adapt to the changes, obstacles and difficulties that many veterans face when they return from active service and, indeed, over very many decades of life in the community. From a family point of view, dealing with issues around post-traumatic stress, for example, is a huge issue, not simply for the veteran but for all of the family and members around that veteran to ensure that the readjustment to civilian and family life is the best it possibly can be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I not only have a strong personal interest in ensuring that veterans are given the best support and assistance available; my electorate of Newcastle, of course, has a very rich history in active military matters and active service and has a very vibrant veteran community. Indeed, there are many examples of Newcastle leading the way in terms of some of the support services, particularly for those Vietnam veterans. I recall as a very young person that my father and many men of his generation returned from Vietnam and started what was then known as the Vietnam Legions in Newcastle. To my knowledge, that was the very first organised Vietnam veterans' association in Australia, and I really wanted to pay tribute to that group of men and their partners who had the vision, the foresight, to ensure that there were in those days very informal supports—not driven by government at all—that were assured to those men and women who'd seen active service. I pay tribute to what was the Vietnam Legions and is now the Newcastle Hunter Region Vietnam Veterans. Today it is headed up by Geoff Linwood. Steve Finney continues to be very active in the role of senior vice-president and Mr Ron Kennedy is the secretary. Of course, many Vietnam vets are now presidents, secretaries and treasurers of all the various RSL sub branches across Newcastle and the Hunter region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt, as I said earlier in this speech, that the transition from military to civilian existence can be very jarring. It can be a very destabilising and, indeed, distressing transition for some people. It was identified in the recently released <span style="font-style:italic;">Mental </span><span style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ealth </span><span style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">revalence and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">athways to </span><span style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">are</span> report as:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… one of the most significant and stressful transitions in the life course of military members world-wide owing to potential changes in identity, community and residence, social networks and status, family roles, occupation, finances, routines, responsibilities, supports and culture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report is the result of one of three studies being undertaken through the Transition and Wellbeing Research Program—the most comprehensive study examining the impact of military service on the mental, physical and social health of serving and ex-serving ADF members and their families. I know this study quite well, and I've participated as a family member in many of these longitudinal studies over the course of my life. So I'm very acutely attuned to the need to pay close attention to the findings of these studies, and I'm very pleased to see that that work is now informing the legislation before this House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first schedule of the bill before us today makes it easier for some veterans to get the skills they need to move into the civilian workforce. That's a great thing. It's hard to overstate the importance of finding meaningful employment post service, not just for financial reasons but also for structure, self-esteem and a sense of inclusion. Finding a job can be one of the most challenging things veterans do after they leave the defence forces. The unemployment rate for veterans sits at a little over 30 per cent, which is five times higher than the national average. For those who didn't discharge medically, there's an estimated 11.2 per cent unemployment rate, which is more than double the national average. Underemployment is also a huge problem with veterans. Almost one in five ex-serving personnel is thought to be underemployed, working in jobs beneath their capacities and with an average of a 30 per cent drop in wages. We need to give ex-service men and women the absolute best chance of building healthy, happy lives, where they're able to contribute fully to their communities and gain secure, meaningful employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of this bill will, as I said, assist returning service men and women who are on incapacity payments and are undertaking further studies as part of their rehabilitation plan. Under this measure, the incapacity payment, which is paid as compensation for loss of earnings as a result of service related conditions, is maintained at 100 per cent of the normal weekly earnings while veterans are doing approved full-time study. At the moment, these payments drop to 75 per cent after 45 weeks, but this provision will maintain full payments. I understand that when this bill is passed, the 100 per cent payment will also be available to veterans currently on full-time study as part of their rehabilitation plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Education and reskilling can be an important part of that transition into civilian life. This measure will give veterans the space they need to focus on their studies and their future without the burden of additional financial pressures. As I mentioned earlier, Labor supports this schedule, which is estimated to help around 150 people per year. Removing barriers to training—helping veterans and giving them time to secure the skills they need—is an absolutely worthwhile endeavour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When close to one-third of veterans are unemployed, clearly much more needs to be done. Veterans bring a wealth of skills, experience and qualities that would be ideal—that are ideal—for any employer. Too often, civilian employers who lack the context and understanding of defence life don't understand the skills and personal qualities that service personnel have to offer and what they bring to the table. Many veterans, having only worked in the military, undersell themselves and what they can bring as civilian employees. Delays in securing work make the transition to civilian life even more difficult and can have a huge impact on the mental health and general happiness of veterans. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you consider that around 5,500 ADF members return to civilian life each year—and every year—we simply cannot afford not to invest in helping people to secure meaningful and rewarding work after their defence service. That's why in March this year Labor pledged $121 million for a package designed to give greater support to defence personnel in the transition to non-military life and civilian employment. I'm very proud of that policy, which has been developed through the hard work and relentless advocacy of the member for Kingston and shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Amanda Rishworth, and a number of colleagues on this side of the House who have direct and lived experience of service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor's veterans' employment program, a dedicated veterans' employment service would be established to give veterans tailored, personalised assistance to find work and make the transition to civilian life. We'd also fund a whole range of other things and an education campaign to help spread the word about the valuable skills, experience and character traits that make veterans an absolute asset to any employer. Labor supports all of the aspects in schedule 1 that I spoke of earlier. Indeed, we'd like them to go further—and that's why I spoke of Labor's own policy and package in this regard—but this is a great start. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also would like to reflect on the second, critically important, measure in this bill—the new suicide prevention pilot that is aimed at improving mental health support for veterans in regional and remote areas. The Mental Health Clinical Management Pilot offers increased support for those who have been hospitalised after attempted suicide or suicide ideation, and targets veterans who have complex mental and social health needs, including homelessness. It will provide intensive and assertive management services to support a veteran after they've been discharged from hospital, which includes support to access other relevant government and non-government treatment services aimed at reducing risk and improving outcomes for those involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had some very recent experience of the very severe stress that serving ADF personnel are under, and I can only say how welcome the changes in this bill will be. I believe that, when it comes to providing those necessary treatments and support to both currently serving and ex-service men and women, we have let the side down on many, many occasions. The family I supported recently in this regard have a lot of questions they want answered about the current services and access, so any improvements in this area that would see us delivering better services for those men and women who are discharged from hospital after a suicide attempt, or who have ideas around suiciding, will be welcome. There is not a more important investment for governments to be making in terms of our support for veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, in 2017, it was estimated that 74 veterans took their own lives. Any suicide is an absolute tragedy, but the national pain that we should all feel when serving and ex-serving men and women take their own lives, after having given so much of themselves to the nation, is absolutely gut wrenching. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare have a report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Incidence of suicide among serving and ex-serving Australian Defence Force personnel 2001–2014</span>. That report found that while men serving full time or in the reserves had significantly lower rates of suicide than the general population, the incidence of suicide amongst ex-servicemen is 14 per cent higher than the general population. I think that those figures are very sobering and something we should all reflect upon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Mental health prevalence</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Pathways to care</span> reports spent a great deal of time looking at this tragic issue and found that one in five transitioning ADF members had experienced suicidal ideation or plans or attempts on their own lives in the previous 12 months. These statistics are deeply shocking and utterly unacceptable. There is absolutely no excuse for us not to be doing much, much better in these areas. There are many other aspects—the changes to enabling an extension of the Long Tan Bursary, some assistance for widows and widowers to make decisions and some changes for submariners and compensation issues—that are all extremely important. I recommend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  To varying degrees, both sides of politics in this country have settled on a social contract where as a society together, through government, we seek to look after those that are less fortunate and those that clearly need our assistance, especially when it comes to their health. This obligation to care for our fellow person is even greater when the cause of their suffering is through their service to our community and nation. We owe a debt to those who put their lives on hold in service of our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When a person enlists with the Australian Defence Force, they undertake a commitment to our country and place their health and wellbeing on the line in service to our nation. In return, we should undertake a commitment to look after them and their families both during and after their time in the ADF. This commitment is about more than just their physical health; it is about taking a holistic view of the member and their loved ones. For those whom service has had a greater impact on, we have a duty of care to them and their family now and into the future. While many will leave the ADF having gained much from the experience and view their service positively, for some their time with the services and their subsequent transition back into civilian life can have a negative impact on their physical and mental health. Mental illness can be an impact of war and service. Without effective support and treatment, the impact on veterans and their support network is significant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The critical role of family members in supporting our current and ex-serving Defence personnel is often not acknowledged or appreciated by society as much as it should be. When an individual serves in the ADF, their family serves with them. Military families make sacrifices. We know that many servicemen and women are deployed internationally for months at a time, with this separation causing emotional stress for partners and children. When personnel are not deployed, there are regular repostings to different bases around the country, meaning that they have to choose between uprooting their whole family and living apart for periods of time. Post service, particularly in the circumstances where someone is medically discharged, the impact can be significant and ongoing. When someone is medically discharged, it is often the family who become their carers. It is the family who help and support them. It is often the family who can identify the first signs of mental illness. It is also the family who can recognise the signs and symptoms of poor physical health. But they need support, too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 2) Bill 2018 contains several measures seeking to improve the lives of those who have served our country and their loved ones. It's the least we can do. Indeed, it's probably even less than what we can and should do but it is at least a start. Transition is a critical juncture in the life of veterans and their families. If not undertaken well, it can lead to worse outcomes for them and their loved ones. This bill seeks to improve this. The first part of the bill recognises the importance of education and retraining for those whose service has had a greater impact on them, whether that be physical or psychological. Further education and training is vital for veterans, particularly when the individual has had no choice but to leave the defence forces and reorientate their lives. Currently, the majority of incapacity payments reduce to 75 per cent of a person's usual earnings after less than a year. Former members of the Australian Defence Force should receive incapacity payments at 100 per cent of their normal weekly earnings when they are studying full time as part of their rehabilitation and integration back into society. This bill will increase their payments up to 100 per cent, providing financial security for veterans and their families. We support this plan and anticipate that about 150 people will benefit from this annually.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Education and reskilling can be an important part of transition for those leaving our defence forces, but, for those who have done so due to injury or illness, reorientating their lives is even more important. This payment will ensure that those receiving incapacity payments don't have to worry about finances as well; they can instead focus on getting back up and running. We believe that, through this training, veterans will be better able to move into meaningful employment post-service. In Perth's south-eastern suburbs that I represent, youth unemployment is very high—near 20 per cent. However, more than 30 per cent of veterans who leave the Defence Force are unable to find employment. For veterans who do find a job after leaving the Defence Force, 19 per cent are underemployed in jobs well below their capacities—and they're likely to cop a pay cut of around 30 per cent for the privilege—upon leaving the Defence Force. It is for this reason that Labor has committed to a $121 million veterans' employment program that seeks to ensure that veterans are best prepared to move into meaningful employment and that employers are able to gain the many advantages of hiring these highly skilled individuals. This will include a scheme that converts rank and length of service into an automatic university entrance rank.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The things that our veterans have seen and experienced should not have to be witnessed by anyone. Post-traumatic stress disorder and other significant mental health issues are commonplace for veterans, sometimes not becoming apparent for many years after leaving services, and affecting not only those who have served but their families and friends too. The Labor-supported Senate inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel, completed last year, has had some especially positive outcomes in the way that we approach these matters. Importantly, it provided a forum to give veterans and their families a voice—an opportunity to prompt much-needed change. For too long, there has been stigma around mental illness and suicide, particularly for our ex-serving personnel. This has meant that some veterans have been reluctant to ask for help, leaving them feeling isolated and often alone. Overcoming stigma is integral to ensuring that those suffering know that they can talk about how they're feeling and to preventing tragedies from occurring. Of course, this is always easier said than done. Through the Senate inquiry, for example, we heard the story of Jesse Bird and the very real and tragic results of not getting post-service care right. Jesse was exposed to significant trauma in his eight months of service in Afghanistan. This caused him to leave the Defence Force. It is clear now that Jesse never received or accessed the care and support that he needed following these traumatic events. Tragically, he took his life in June last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The risk of suicide among those who have left the service is 13 per cent higher than the general population. This is a figure that can no longer be ignored. This bill will also see the creation of a new suicide prevention pilot to provide greater support to those who have attempted to take their own lives or are at risk of doing so. This program will add to the two other suicide prevention trials currently being coordinated by the Department of Veterans' Affairs that followed the Senate inquiry and the National Mental Health Commission's review of services for veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill is a logical change that will provide greater support for those recently widowed. I can only imagine that the untimely death of a partner is one of the most difficult times in anyone's life, so to take the pressure off any formal decision-making required through Veterans' Affairs is a welcome one. Currently, such partners have six months to decide how they would like to receive their compensation. These changes will amend the amount of time that wholly dependent partners have to make a decision on the mode of compensation that they will receive for up to two years. This amendment will ensure that those individuals, who are in exceptionally difficult circumstances, have sufficient time to make a decision about their financial arrangements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 of the bill amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act in order to extend the eligibility of the Long Tan Bursary to grandchildren of Vietnam veterans, with priority to be given to supporting the children of Vietnam veterans. The Long Tan Bursary offers 37 scholarships of up to $12,000 over three years to children of Vietnam veterans to assist with post-secondary school education and training. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments in schedule 5 will simplify the support available to those who have served as submariners between 1978 and 1992 and have a claim with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Labor is supportive of these measures in recognising the service of these submariners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final schedule to this bill simplifies the process for veterans applying for compensation under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. Under that act a claim for compensation is distinct from a claim for liability. In many cases compensation is claimed concurrently with liability by a member or a former member indicating on the liability claim form that they are seeking compensation, but sometimes these claims are made without an application for compensation. As part of this process, a needs assessment is carried out, which is often conducted over the telephone. Under these changes, if someone were to indicate verbally that they are seeking compensation, it will be considered to be an application, thereby streamlining the process for our veterans and cutting back on unnecessary red tape. No longer will they be required to only submit such a claim in writing. This should make the claims processing easier for veterans. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that the shadow minister for veterans' affairs has often alluded to issues surrounding the needs assessment by advocates and members of the ex-service community, as the assessment is used to determine compensation claims. According to those who have spoken to us, the information provided during the assessment has been used to decline or reduce the severity of claims years down the track. The government has now advised that needs assessments are not used to determine compensation but rather to identify forms of support veterans may be eligible for. The government will be providing further clarification to veterans that the online assessment is not used in the calculation of compensation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The long and overly complicated and sometimes adversarial nature of the claims process for some veterans has been raised from time to time. During many inquiries submitters have highlighted these issues, describing the DVA claims process as 'challenging' and weighing 'heavily upon one's mental health and wellbeing, generally at a time when one is at an extremely low ebb'. Prior to the last election, Labor sought to resolve such issues by undertaking a first principles review of Veterans' Affairs. Our proposal for a first principles review was a holistic end-to-end review of the department based on a set of agreed first principles. The review would examine the department and seek to rectify administrative process failings to ensure the department is actually able to meet existing and future challenges in a clear and efficient manner. Most importantly, such a review would help to re-establish the trust of veterans and their representative organisations in the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Australian Defence Force personnel put their lives on hold in the service of our country. They take risks. They make sacrifices, sometimes committing their lives and wellbeing for the good of our country. In return we must do everything in our power to support them during their service as well as after it. As I've heard when meeting with my local RSLs, as I have seen with my friends and my family's friends, as I have discussed with our serving Defence Force personnel when I was fortunate enough to spend time with them last year in the Middle East and Afghanistan as well as on some bases in WA, and as many of my constituents who themselves are veterans regularly remind me these risks and sacrifices and the physical and mental pain that follow are very real. They are hard to manage. They have a huge toll on them as individuals. They have a huge toll on their families. They need our community's full support. These measures and this bill are but a small part in ensuring that we recognise our obligation to our ex-service community. Hence, I and Labor offer our full support for this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Personnel, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  In summing up, I'd like to thank all members who contributed to the debate on this bill and acknowledge the continued tradition of bipartisan support for the veteran community. The purpose of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Veteran-centric Reforms No. 2) Bill 2018 is to implement several new initiatives to deliver a range of services to the veteran community and also to their families. The measures in this bill demonstrate that the government is listening and is putting the veteran community first. Each of the sets of amendments will mean better outcomes for veterans and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd particularly like to note two of the more significant measures in this bill. Schedule 1 of the bill will enable veterans participating in a rehabilitation plan and approved full-time study to receive 100 per cent of their incapacity payment. Without this amendment, a veteran's incapacity payments would reduce to 75 per cent or more, depending on their weekly hours worked after 45 weeks. Schedule 2 of this bill will give effect to a new veteran suicide prevention pilot. I've heard many members speak in relation to their concerns regarding the need for greater mental health support for veterans. The veteran suicide prevention pilot will provide mental health support for veterans who have been hospitalised after attempted suicide, have suicide ideation or may be at increased risk of suicide because of their mental health or other factors. The veteran suicide prevention pilot will target a small subset of veterans with complex mental and social health needs, including homelessness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge the contribution of members to the debate of this bill, including the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Amanda Rishworth, who noted that the bill would improve outcomes for those who have served in the Australian Defence Force and for their loved ones. She noted we made a commitment to ADF members and their loved ones and that we will support them post their time in the ADF. Again, it was good to see bipartisan support across the chamber. The shadow minister also noted that schedule 1 recognises the importance of education and retraining post service and provides financial security to those who are on incapacity payments and are undertaking further study as part of their rehabilitation plan with the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank the member for Forrest, who spoke about the evolution of support that widows received by recounting the support her own mother received from Legacy when she was widowed many years ago and that DVA now provides support to veterans and their families. In particular, schedule 3 will give partners more time to choose whether to receive the compensation payable for their partner's death as a weekly payment or a lump sum, or a combination of both—whatever works for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to provide further clarification on comments made by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs and the member for Bass, and repeated by other members during the debate. The comment relates to the unemployment rate for veterans as being approximately 30 per cent. It's important to note that the latest research on veterans and underemployment would indicate that, in the first 10 months from separation from Defence into civilian life, the unemployment rate for veterans is about eight per cent, which is obviously still higher than the national average but is nowhere near the 30 per cent figure which is often quoted both in the House and in the media. The 30 per cent figure relates to a previous study done by an organisation. The information is somewhat dated. I believe it's important that members are aware of the more up-to-date information and the research being undertaken by Defence and by Veterans' Affairs to get a better handle on the underemployment and unemployment amongst our veteran community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I made the point last week, during an address here in Canberra, and I make the point again today here in the chamber: we can do better in relation to unemployment for our veterans. It's in partnership with our community, the business sector, the corporate sector and industry, along with all government agencies, that we can make sure that we work collaboratively to assist veterans in making the transition into civilian employment. I made the point last week that employing a veteran is simply good for your business. They have a range of skills which have been developed, often over a period of years. They have developed leadership, teamwork and a good work ethic. They're disciplined and have a range of skills that have been taught to them and are easily transferrable to civilian life. It is simply good for your business to consider hiring a veteran in the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to a second comment by the shadow minister about how DVA uses particular information provided by veterans during the claim process, particularly the online claim process called MyService, I just want to confirm that the responses to questions about lifestyle and needs assessment are not used by DVA to determine compensation but are, instead, used to identify forms of support and assistance the veteran may be entitled to. DVA has now updated the online page on MyService to make it clear that the information is optional and the answers are not used to calculate compensation rates. I commend this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  These bills represent the second stage of the ASIC Industry Funding Model, and Labor supports their passage. On 1 July 2017, the first stage of the ASIC Industry Funding Model commenced, with the introduction of industry levies to recover the costs of ASIC's regulatory activities. This allowed ASIC to apportion and recoup its regulatory costs from each of the sectors and subsectors that it regulates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supported the bills to introduce that ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy. We're supportive of the principle that ASIC, as a regulator, recover regulatory costs that should be borne by those entities that cause the need for the activity that ASIC undertakes in regulating the industry. This is a principle that's been applied in relation to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, and this second stage deals with fees for services. It's based on the principle that ASIC's costs for specific regulatory activities requested by an entity should be recovered from that entity. This is to the extent that the fee directly represents the efficient costs of providing the regulatory activity or service, and it's on the basis that such services primarily benefit the entity that sought them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this scheme of bills, these fees will be paid by entities for ASIC's demand-driven services. Some of the services that are intended to be captured by these new arrangements, amongst other things, are document compliance reviews, licence applications or variations by Australian financial services licensees and Australian credit licensees, and applications for registration by managed investment schemes. We understand that the fees attached to ASIC forms relating to updating the ASIC registry are not in the intended scope for this bill. ASIC has released a cost-recovery implementation statement setting out how it proposes to implement these fee-for-service elements of the industry funding model. We also understand that the fee amounts would be reviewed every three years and that these reviews will include, importantly, consultation with the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has assured the House, in her second reading speech, that 'The government has consulted extensively with the industry on the design of the ASIC Industry Funding Model.' But, of course, when it comes to ASIC and financial services regulation, this government, unfortunately, has a very poor record, particularly when it comes to properly funding and resourcing ASIC to do its job. We've seen a litany of scandals in the financial services and banking industry over the course of the last decade in Australia that have led to the loss of millions of dollars for many hardworking Australians and their families and, importantly, small businesses as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to ASIC, the recent history shows quite clearly what the Abbott and Turnbull governments tried to do in terms of gutting the regulator to undermine its ability to uncover and prosecute some of the unconscionable financial services conduct that we've seen over the last number of years. It should never be forgotten that in 2014 the Abbott government slashed ASIC's funding by $120 million. At the Senate estimates after the 2014 budget, the then ASIC chairman, Greg Medcraft, explained how ASIC would deal with that cut of $120 million to its funding model. Among other things, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In particular, our proactive surveillance will substantially reduce across the sectors we regulate and, in some cases, it will stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That became the case, unfortunately, and now we're all ruing it and seeing the results of it in the financial services royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One need look no further than the wealth management scandal at the Commonwealth Bank. Whistleblowers attempted to contact ASIC on three or four occasions, through phone calls and through emails, about what was going on in CommBank and the dodgy financial advice that was being given to Australians and small businesses in that particular organisation. The whistleblowers had to rock up to the ASIC office, risking their livelihoods and their employment, and actually force ASIC to have a look at what was going on in the Commonwealth Bank. That, of course, led to the uncovering of the likes of the so-called dodgy Don Nguyen and the CommBank scandal where literally thousands of customers had been ripped off by poor financial advice. That may not have happened if ASIC had ignored those initial pleas from those whistleblowers, as they initially did; none of this may have been uncovered and people would have gone on losing substantial sums of money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But Mr Medcraft didn't stop there. He went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Some examples of the changes in our consumer cluster are the deposit takers, credit and insurance team. There will be reduced proactive surveillance. As a result, they will focus on activity by entities that have the greatest market impact at the expense of smaller entities that have a smaller customer basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That says it all about the approach of this government to the regulation of financial services in this country. They've got the backs of big business; we see that through the corporate tax cut they're trying to get through the Senate at the moment. They want to reduce corporate taxes for the biggest businesses in this country—including the big four banks, believe it or not. But there you have it. When the Abbott government cut $120 million from the ASIC budget, where was the first area of proactive surveillance to go? It was in the smaller players; it was the small players who operate in this industry, and that predominantly affects small businesses, local farmers, families that are running businesses in all sorts of industries and, of course, mum-and-dad investors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what we saw happen in the financial services royal commission—a royal commission that Labor's been calling for for many years and which was opposed by those opposite. When I spoke earlier about who they're backing and who they've got the backs of, again it's evidenced in their approach to the royal commission. They didn't want it. They wanted to protect the banks. They wanted to protect their mates in banking—where a lot of them come from, including the Prime Minister. The result of the $120 million cut in funding was, not surprisingly, a devastating loss of staff and expertise, with a significant effect on the ability of the corporate and financial services regulator to address misconduct. It was a further kick in the guts to those who'd been the victims of financial rip-offs over recent years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the depths of the cuts to ASIC and their massive impact, the government took zero action and only partially unwound the cuts when Labor began to shine a light on the industry and, typically, when these issues began to be uncovered by the media. It really took the media to uncover the scandal before the government did anything. The government ignored the representations that, no doubt, their MPs were getting from constituents about what was going on; ignored the findings of several Senate and joint committee inquiries and reports into what was going on in financial services; ignored the media reports and uncovering of these issues by several investigative reporters; and ignored the impact of collapses of companies like Trio Capital, Storm Financial, Timbercorp and the like, and the pleas of their victims, for 600 days. But, when the big four banks wrote to Malcolm Turnbull and said, 'Yes, it's okay to hold a royal commission now. We've got no choice. You're going to have to do it,' he rolled over and that's exactly what he did. That was on the back of cutting the funding to ASIC, the watchdog that was keeping an eye on these activities going on in the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Millions of Australians have been let down by this government when it comes to regulation of financial services. The government only sought to backtrack on these cuts after Labor began calling for a royal commission, in 2016. But the impact on ASIC of the cuts to it cannot be undone so easily. These were cuts to the capability of the corporate regulator, and a free pass for financial services misconduct. It's consistent with the attitude of this government, which spent 601 days resisting the urgent need for a royal commission into the banking and financial services sector. Labor have been fully vindicated in our prosecution of the case for a royal commission into financial services and banks in Australia. Despite the government's claims that we were misleading the Australian people, trying to undermine trust in the financial services industry and trying to undermine the superannuation balances of Australians—the wealth creation vehicles of hardworking Australians—the hypocrisy of this government has been exposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In responding to the financial systems inquiry, the government promised to update the ASIC statement of expectations by mid-2016. It took until 2018 for the minister to announce a new statement, after pressure from Labor in Senate estimates. It's really only when Labor puts pressure on the government, or if the media come asking, and shines a light on what's going on in financial services that the government acts, because they don't want to act against the interests of those that they seek to represent in this place—those, indeed, from which many of them have come. The statement of expectations is an important document. It sets out the government's expectations of how ASIC will fulfil its mandate. In the meantime, they left the Abbott-era 2014 statement of expectations in place—and a lot has changed in this industry since 2014, as we've seen—which focused a lot on red-tape reduction and very little on ensuring good consumer outcomes. Again, it goes to the philosophy of this government when it comes to financial services regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to comprehend what I'm talking about, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, then you need look no further than the current government's approach to the Future of Financial Advice legislation. It should never be forgotten. The coalition's opposition to the FOFA laws and its attempts to hollow them out really were rank hypocrisy. After the high-profile collapses of schemes like Trio Capital, Westpoint and Opes Prime, the then Labor government decided those outside the industry deserved protection from unscrupulous financial advisers. The FOFA legislation gave ASIC important tools to regulate those particular industries. Those laws were introduced to help prevent the same scandalous behaviour driven by greed and distorted financial incentives that we're unfortunately still seeing today and that are the subject of a lot of evidence before the royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of FOFA was the best-interest test for clients. Believe it or not, up until Labor introduced this best-interest test in the FOFA legislation there was no legal requirement for a financial services adviser to act in the best interests of their client—and guess what? In many cases, they simply didn't. And we saw the results of that in many of the cases that I mentioned earlier. At the heart of these financial advice reforms was the best-interest test, a legal obligation for financial advisers to do the right thing by their customers. Now, it's hard to believe but prior to FOFA there was no such legal obligation for financial advisers to act in the best interests of their customers, and many didn't. FOFA also required an opt-in requirement, meaning that financial advisers and clients with ongoing fee arrangements must agree to opt in to that service on an ongoing basis, and the relationship must continue—and that happens every two years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It must be pointed out that, in opposition, those opposite voted against these reforms. That's right, the members of the government voted against a best-interest duty, particularly the catch-all provision at the end of the duty and the opt-in provisions every two years. They came in here and spouted to the public that this was unnecessary red tape, it was overregulation and it was a financial burden on those poor banks. That poor AMP! I remember reading the inquiry report that was handed down by the joint parliamentary committee that initially looked at the FOFA legislation, and the dissenting report. The dissenting report was authored by none other than the current Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, who, believe it or not, used the evidence of AMP in his report to say why the Future of Financial Advice reforms should not be passed. Yes, that's right: he used the advice of AMP. Have a look at what AMP have done. No wonder AMP came to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Financial Services and argued that FOFA shouldn't go through. We all know why now! It's been uncovered in the royal commission the reason why they didn't want FOFA to be implemented. In fact, they said it would result in the loss of 30,000 jobs in the financial services industry. Have a guess who picked it up and used it in his report? The finance minister, Senator Cormann. He quoted them and said, 'This is what will occur and we're going to back AMP on this.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now you see members of the government coming out and saying: 'What a shock it is, this evidence being uncovered in the royal commission. This is unacceptable and this behaviour must stop.' Guess what? If the government had their way, none of this would be illegal. It wouldn't be illegal at all, because the catch-all provision, the best-interest duty and the opt-in provision wouldn't exist and none of this behaviour that we're uncovering in the royal commission would be illegal. In fact, when they got elected to government in 2013, one of their first acts was to try to water down and undermine the best-interest duty in the Future of Financial Advice reforms. They actually got it through this parliament—so all of those opposite voted for it—and they got it through the Senate. It was only with a rescission motion that we were able to unwind that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when they come in here and talk about bolstering funding for ASIC, when they come in here and talk about being tough on the banks and when they come in here and talk about supporting a royal commission, it's nothing more than rank hypocrisy, because their records speak for themselves. They opposed the royal commission all the way, they voted against the Future of Financial Advice reforms and they tried to undermine them when they came to office, and then they cut funding for ASIC in their first budget. At the time, Senator Cormann said that FOFA legislation went too far by having a legal obligation requiring the financial advisers to take reasonable steps in their clients' best interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In government, they tried to gut FOFA, first by legislation and then by regulation. ASIC identified FOFA requirements as being significant in helping uncover the massive fees-for-no-service scandal that we saw in the financial services industry, in which clients were charged by the big banks and AMP for advice that was never provided—and I mentioned AMP earlier. These are the people that the government sought to protect against the interests of mum-and-dad investors and small businesses. If this government had its way, there would be no laws against what the banks and the likes of AMP have been doing to hardworking Australians. It would simply be a bad look for them. Ultimately, there would be none of the accountability to the Australian people that we're getting in the royal commission at the moment</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet we now see, of course, the same Liberal and Nationals MPs expressing outrage at the behaviour that has been uncovered by the royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is beyond me to comprehend why anyone would want to water down laws that say that a financial adviser has to act in the best interests of their client. But that is exactly what this government tried to do when they tried to water down the FOFA requirements. The heart-wrenching stories of mum-and-dad investors losing everything in a string of financial scandals in the wake of the global financial crisis was not enough to stop the coalition removing protection for customers from dodgy financial advisers. That says everything about this government's approach to financial services regulation. The hypocrisy of this government knows no bounds when it comes to the issues of the royal commission into FOFA and, indeed, the funding of ASIC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was Labor that was strong on the royal commission. It was Labor that forced through the Future of Financial Advice reforms to protect people in the unregulated market, particularly when it came to superannuation. It was Labor that bolstered our superannuation laws in Australia. It's Labor that's been pushing for improved reform and additional requirements on financial advisers in this country. Importantly, it was Labor that criticised the government and pushed the government to ensure that they properly funded ASIC, although there were job losses and a loss of expertise and they haven't fully recovered all the funding that the government cut in that original 2014 budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This reform is something that Labor does support, because the cost-recovery model to ensure that ASIC is properly funded and can do its work, particularly, in the area of prevention of financial scandals is something that we need to see more of. It's just a shame that it took the royal commission, that it took all of the pain and suffering of many in this area—particularly mum-and-dad investors and small businesses—and that it took media interest and several inquiries for the government to work out that they'd made a mistake and did the wrong thing in cutting ASIC's funding. I commend these bills the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  I rise today to support the Corporations (Fees) Amendment (ASIC Fees) Bill 2018 and related bills. This legislation will allow the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, otherwise known as ASIC, to operate in a more efficient and effective manner. Corporate governance and the enforcement of sensible regulations are key to a functioning society and financial sector. We only have to look back as far as 2008 to the fallout of the global financial crisis to see the impact that poor accountability in governance can have on public confidence in the financial system and its ability to operate in a sustainable manner. This initiative is one part of this government's commitment to ensuring that the Australian people have trust and confidence in the financial system and the likes of ASIC. Only through improving the manner in which ASIC operates and the transparency of its actions can we look to safeguard trust in our institutions and their ability to function.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will increase fee caps to allow ASIC to recover the costs it incurs when providing regulatory services. This is in conjunction with expanding the definition of 'chargeable matters' and clarifying fee regulations regarding what constitutes a chargeable matter. The bill has been devised in consultation with stakeholders and follows acceptance of the April 2016 recommendation of financial system inquiry to introduce an industry funding model for ASIC. Thorough consultation is essential to good government, and a functioning democracy and the implementation of the inquiry's recommendations are a testament to this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the core of the bill is a focus on equity and accountability. Gone are the days of nominal fees that are subsidised by taxpayers. Now the recipients of a government activity will be the ones that solely bear its costs. Taxpayers will be saved from their burden by the introduction of a fee for service which differs depending on the time and effort involved in the task. The bill will make ASIC more accountable and increase stakeholder awareness regarding how much a government activity costs. The industry-funding model's introduction will also help to encourage regulatory compliance and improve ASIC's resource allocation. A more accountable ASIC, acting as a strong and fair corporate regulator, is undoubtedly a good thing. Australians deserve to know why charges are made and where the money goes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party is committed to promoting efficiency and reducing red tape. Unnecessary bureaucracy kills investment and the confidence of individuals to take a risk through entrepreneurship. Our economy is built on individual Australians and businesses having a go and being confident enough to build towards a better future. While the Labor Party seeks to destroy innovation and entrepreneurship through their mantra of big government, we, as Liberals, are committed to ensuring that Australians are given the opportunity to pursue their ambitions. However, when there is a role for regulation and corporate regulators such as ASIC, it is our firm belief, as Liberals, that such regulation should be effective and transparent. There is no point in having an independent Australian government body and corporate regulator that cannot act as it was intended to act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Good governance and the equitable enforcement of regulations are paramount to the viability and long-term performance of our industries. ASIC plays an important role in this by acting as Australia's corporate regulator. Efficient and transparent governance is an essential tenet of a functioning democracy, with independent government bodies ensuring that regulations are enforced properly, regardless of how the political landscape is playing out. Independent bodies are a core tenet of a liberal society and system of governance and inspire confidence in our system. Ensuring that ASIC can set and has the means to set appropriate changes will allow it to maintain the rule of law and enforce regulations in the company and financial sectors. The bill, and the funding model that it proposes, will improve consumer outcomes by allowing ASIC to better predict, monitor and respond to market risks and allow for the redirection of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars towards activities that benefit more taxpayers. Government has a responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and in an equitable manner, and this bill builds towards that end goal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in pressing times when the very structures of our democratic institutions are under threat. The recent phenomena of fake news and alternative facts have led to the promotion of a mindset that objective thought and our very democracy are crumbling. The line between fact and fiction has been blurred. These circumstances provide all the more reason for the reassertion of the value of transparency and its importance to democratic institutions and, in particular, market institutions. The key ideal that separates liberal democracies from systems of centralised governance and authoritarianism is an emphasis on openness and accountability. As American attorney and orator Patrick Henry reminds us:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The liberties of a people never were, nor ever will be, secure, when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trust in government in the West has also recently hit all-time lows. The Pew Research Centre found that only 18 per cent of Americans say they can trust the government in Washington to do what is right just about always or most of the time. Contrast this to the 1958 national election study, which found that 75 per cent of Americans strongly trusted Washington to get it right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is not necessarily fairing much better. The 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer, which measures public trust in four types of institutions across 28 countries, found that the percentage of Australians who say they have trust in their governments has declined to 35 per cent. This puts Australia on the same level as Spain, Ireland, the UK and Japan. As Steve Spurr, CEO of Edelman Australia commented:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is deeply troubling that a majority of Australians believe their government is broken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Such an emotive description of government as 'broken' may be a stretch too far. The rise of parties and figures outside the historically predominant Liberal, National and Labor groupings does indicate a changing political landscape in Australia. While some will blame these trends on the 24-hour news cycle or increasingly cynical populations, it is clear that there has been a shift in views on government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fall of the Roman Republic lends some interesting lessons on the deterioration of institutions. Richard Alston, a professor of Roman history at the University of London, wrote the renowned book <span style="font-style:italic;">Rome's Revolution: Death of the Republic and Birth of the Empire</span>. The rise of the Roman Empire and fall of the democratic republic were in part due to the decay and corruption of age-old institutions weakened by special interests and a lack of accountability. For Rome, the greatest threat to republicanism wasn't outside forces but internal power grabs cloaked in the rhetoric of populist government. The likes of Caesar and Octavian knew how to play the system and its people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is not at risk of descending from democracy to dictatorship like the old Roman Empire but there are still important lessons on transparency and government accountability to be heeded. Government should be trying to do all it can to ensure it supports transparent processes so as to rebuild voter trust and confidence in democratic and market institutions. This support is vital to the continuing existence of our democratic system and the ability of our society to function harmoniously. If government cannot be open and trust the people to keep it accountable, then what chance is there for the people to trust in government?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will breed confidence and promote investment. Public reaction to the recent banking royal commission has demonstrated that increasingly large numbers of Australians feel at odds with our banking and financial sectors. Now more than ever it is imperative that Australians be reminded that structures and bodies such as ASIC are in place and are being supported in their role of promoting proper conduct and enforcing laws. Only through having a strong, transparent and equitable financial sector can we hope to continue attracting vital foreign investment and ensure that companies want to come to Australia and employ Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As of December 2017, Australia is ranked 14th in received foreign direct investment stock, ahead of the likes of Italy and Russia, but behind the likes of Belgium and Canada. It has often been said one of the major attractions of Australia to foreign investors is its stable political and financial institutions, and transparent governance systems. This will only continue to be the case if the government is committed to ensuring that Australian government standards are high and our financial sector is fair and transparent, and this government is committed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is too much at stake for us to rest on our laurels. In this day and age of fiercer than ever global competition, if investors do not deem Australia a suitable destination for their money, they will look elsewhere. The value of ensuring Australia has a functioning, open and fair financial sector is there for all to see. We the government must do all we can to support independent bodies such as ASIC and provide the framework for them to operate efficiently and equitably. This bill will serve as an important step to improving ASIC and its capacity to raise funds and charge fees in a transparent manner. Crucially, the bill will demonstrate this government's commitment to good governance and public taxpayer money being spent fairly, sensibly and effectively. These are notions that all Australians should support; hence I am proud to support this bill and I commend it to the House.</span>

                    <a href="249147" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:52</span>):  Yet another sitting week and yet another piece of legislation dealing with ASIC, it is almost as if the government thinks it can convince the public that by having a separate piece of legislation for every sitting week that we come here that has something to do with an economic regulator that they might just think that they are going to get tough on the banks and tough on financial regulation. Before I get into the substantive remarks of my speech, can I just commend the member for Mackellar for giving an absolute textbook workshop on how to speak about absolutely nothing to do with the bill and somehow top and tail his speech to make it vaguely relevant. I really want to commend him for that effort.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month, it was revealed that ASIC asked the federal government for more funding to embed its own staff into the big banks, the intention being to ensure the banks are complying with—wait for it—the law, the rules and regulations. This comes following allegations of misconduct by the biggest banks in Australia and the financial advisers that work for them. Considering the appalling stories that we have heard come out of the royal commission into banking, this is a strategy that, I believe, should be supported. The misconduct by the nation's biggest banks and financial advisers is clearly inexcusable. People have lost their homes, their businesses, their life savings. Customers have been charged fees for nothing. It seems not even death will stop some of our financial institutions from charging you a fee. In the most recent sittings of the royal commission, we heard about people losing their homes and businesses due to poor financial advice. We heard about banks knowingly taking advantage of guarantors who were not capable of making educated financial decisions themselves and were being misled. That's only been unlawful in this country for around 30-odd years but we still see that conduct. So I do support ASIC embedding supervisors inside some of the country's largest financial institutions because, clearly, there is a lot of work to be done in changing their culture and attitude and because, when left to their devices, following the law seems to be quite beyond them. We need to ensure that these previous misdemeanours—and 'misdemeanours' is putting it lightly—are never repeated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that, along with onsite supervision by ASIC—staff being placed in these organisations when required—it is also proposed that staff will work off-site at ASIC, continuing to conduct surveillance and data collection. These activities would be determined by necessity and re-evaluated periodically as required. With the vast majority of the banking market in the clutches of the big four banks—in fact, nearly 80 per cent of banking business occurs between those four—valuable insights would be gained from data collection and analysis, and one would hope that this would serve as an ongoing reminder, to ensure previous malefactions are never repeated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIC is in negotiation with the government to secure this funding, for what I believe is a very valid cause. The new Chair of ASIC, Mr Shipton, revealed in Senate estimates that he had already met with the Treasurer and the financial services minister, and they'd both responded positively, apparently, to this request for funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems that the Treasurer is forgetting, though, his own industry funding model, specifically designed for ASIC, which, of course, we debate now in this bill. In 2016, the industry funding model was proposed and designed to ensure that financial institutions—including the banks, auditors, insolvency practitioners and credit licensees—would pay to ASIC certain levies to fund its work to hold them to account. In theory, the better behaved these financial institutions are as a whole, the less work ASIC will need to do, and that will of course reduce the bill that these financial institutions need to pay. It's pretty simple, and that's why Labor supported that legislation—though, at the time, I do recall remarking that, as with so many pieces of the government's legislation, I suspected there might be a few ways that they could improve it, pointing to some of the other industry funding models that already exist for other regulators. So I find it interesting that, now, we have this legislation, and we also have a process where ASIC has approached government saying that they need more financial support. It seems to suggest that the industry funding model is deficient to provide the money that ASIC requires to do its job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that we now debate is part of this furtherance of the industry funding model. This is the fee-for-services phase, and it's based on the principle that ASIC's costs for specific regulatory activities to do with an entity should be fully recovered from that particular entity. This bill is to ensure that those financial institutions pay, effectively, for their bad behaviour and regulation. So if the government is considering funding ASIC's plan to embed staff in these big banks then clearly it has no faith in its own industry funding model. Why would the government consider charging the taxpayer to keep an eye on the banks when—and I think this is quite apparent to everyone—the banks are more than capable of footing the bill themselves?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017, the first stage of ASIC's industry funding model was implemented, with the introduction of industry levies to recover the costs of ASIC's regulatory activities. This was supported by Labor at the time, and we are supportive of this bill as well. The principle is that ASIC's regulatory costs should be borne by those entities it regulates and oversees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills before us today take this, as I say, a step further. This stage deals with fees for services. This is on the basis that those services primarily benefit that entity that has sought them, and they include document compliance reviews, licence applications or variations for various Australian financial services licences and credit licensees. ASIC has released a cost-recovery implementation settlement, setting out how it proposes to implement these fees-and-services elements of its industry funding. The overarching motive is that it creates more incentive for self-regulation and to improve the behaviour of those operating in the financial services sector. We understand that those fees will be reviewed every three years. The minister has assured the House that the government has consulted extensively with industry on the design of this funding model—and no doubt industry is probably pretty happy with it, because it seems like those that are making the most money out of the financial services regulatory system, the banks, won't even have to pay to have people embedded in them to make sure that they follow the law. I'm sure industry is pretty happy with that!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope the government really has done its homework here and that it does manage these changes appropriately because, when it comes to ASIC and financial services regulation, frankly, this government has a pretty shoddy record. In 2014, this government's budget made significant cuts to ASIC's funding. At estimates the same year, the then chairman, Greg Medcraft, explained that ASIC's 'proactive surveillance' would 'substantially reduce across the sectors' that they regulated because of those cuts, and that, in some cases, it would even stop!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIC said that it would be forced to focus on activity by entities that have the greatest market impact and that it would have to be at the expense of smaller entities with smaller customer bases. It took two years for the government to backtrack on those cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this was all after Labor started making these calls for the obviously much-needed and required banking royal commission, but the impact of those cuts on ASIC could not be easily undone. In fact, ASIC gave evidence before the House economics committee, of which I am a member, that it has taken it quite a while, even when such funding was restored, to be able to restore the staffing levels that were cut as a result of it losing that funding. It created the situation, effectively, where we find ourselves now, where we had to hold a royal commission into the banking sector—a royal commission that this government resisted holding for more than 600 days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In responding to the financial systems inquiry, the government promised to update ASIC's statement of expectations by mid-2016 as part of reviewing its overall regulatory approach of ASIC. True to government form, I suppose it did pretty well by actually getting around to doing it by 2018. If you compare it to delivering the NBN, that's exceedingly quick when it comes to a rollout, compared to some of the other processes this government has undertaken. But by 2018 we finally got around to seeing the new statement of expectations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Up until that time, though, we were stuck with the Abbott-era 2014 statement of expectations, which was focused on what this government likes to call 'red tape reduction', which they say is to the detriment of consumer outcomes. Another name for red tape would be 'appropriate regulation to protect consumers from the big banks ripping them off'. We can never forget, of course, that this is the government which, when in opposition, opposed Labor's Future of Financial Advice laws and which has attempted to hollow them out ever since coming into government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The FOFA legislation was to give ASIC the important tools it needed to make sure that the financial services industry was properly regulated. It included a new test: the best-interest test, a legal obligation for financial advisers to do the right thing by their customers. A novel concept. It was a concept so novel that those now in government opposed it. And, of course, the importance of that test has been so clearly highlighted by the evidence coming out of the banking royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When in opposition, the government opposed the FOFA—it voted against it—and when in government, the Liberal Party tried to gut it. It tried to stop it; it tried to delay it—first by legislation, then by regulation and then by having ASIC delay and defer its implementation. Luckily for Australians—for Australian financial services consumers, who are, let's face it, nearly every Australian—Labor has prevailed in the Senate to stop the government's actions in trying to stop these laws from being in force. ASIC has subsequently identified the FOFA requirements as being significant in helping to uncover the massive fees-for-no-service scandal unveiled prior to and during the royal commission, in which clients were charged by the big banks for advice which they never provided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw in the budget this May that ASIC's funding has been cut again. Even in this industry-funding environment, there was a cut by government of $26 million over the next three years. I thought industry funding was supposed to make sure ASIC was adequately funded. Of course, then we also saw that there's no guarantee of funding for the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce beyond 30 June next year. It is quite clear that, for all of the talk—for all of the bark—that we get from this government, there is no bite when it comes to financial services regulation. They talk a big game. They say, even after we've seen these things revealed at the royal commission, 'That's okay, we're gonna throw the book at this lot.' And what do they actually do? What book are they going to throw? The increased penalties ASIC asked for five years ago still haven't appeared. Then, when we look at what the resources are to make sure that these big banks and other financial services are held to account—wait for it!—they've cut $26 million in funding over the next three years from the corporate regulator, the one that's now supposed to be industry funded. And they haven't provided any additional funds. In fact, funds have been cut from the Commonwealth DPP, which is the entity that actually has to pursue these prosecutions when they eventuate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is in stark contrast to Labor's approach, which would set up a $25 million special task force in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to make sure those who need to be held to account are properly held to account, with prosecutions being pursued as we see the findings come out of this royal commission. It is quite clear that only Labor will continue the work of the royal commission in making sure that it delivers justice so that those who have suffered from financial misconduct can be vindicated and those who have caused those financial crimes to be committed against them will be held to account. It is only Labor that will make sure there is appropriate regulation of our banks, that there is proper funding of our financial regulators to ensure that the people that caused this pain to so many Australians are properly held to account, and that the right thing is done to make sure that we have a proper and sustainable footing for our economy going forward that people can have trust in.</span>

                    <a href="LKU" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'DWYER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  Firstly, I'd like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. Strong and effective financial regulators go hand in hand with a strong and effective financial system. This was one of the reasons the government commissioned the Financial System Inquiry in 2013. This review resulted in recommendations to strengthen the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the corporate market's financial services and consumer credit regulator. The Corporations (Fees) Amendment (ASIC Fees) Bill 2018 and associated bills implement a recommendation from this review—the introduction of an industry funding model for ASIC. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The industry funding model's introduction has significant benefits, including improving equity, as the costs of regulation are borne by those who have created the need for it rather than Australian taxpayers; encouraging regulatory compliance, as good conduct will reduce supervisory levies; improving ASIC's resource allocation, by providing ASIC with richer data to better identify emerging risks; and enhancing ASIC's transparency and accountability. The government is committed to ensuring that ASIC has the resources and powers it needs to combat misconduct in Australia's financial services industry and bolster consumer confidence in the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistent with this commitment, the government has introduced legislation on the second phase of the ASIC industry funding model—the introduction of ASIC fees for service. Under the ASIC industry funding model, from 1 July 2018 fees for service will be introduced to recover ASIC regulatory costs that are directly attributable to a specific entity, such as the processing of a licence application. Currently the fees associated with these activities do not reflect the costs to ASIC of undertaking these activities. Traditionally many of these activities have only attracted a nominal fee, which has not been subject to any review, resulting in the cost of these activities being subsidised by taxpayers. This measure fulfils the government's commitment in accepting recommendation 29 of the Financial System Inquiry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure builds on the other key initiatives undertaken by the government to ensure that ASIC has the powers it needs to promote trust and confidence in the financial system, including establishing and implementing the recommendations of the ASIC Enforcement Review Taskforce to substantially increase the penalties available to ASIC and to boost its regulatory toolkit; appointing a new ASIC chairman, James Shipton, who brings deep regulatory and financial market knowledge to the role; creating a second deputy-chairman role, with a focus on enforcement, and appointing the highly regarded Daniel Crennan QC to this position; legislating to remove ASIC employees from the Public Service Act to enhance ASIC's ability to attract and retain the best staff; and legislating to include competition considerations within ASIC's mandate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the introduction of the second and final phase of the ASIC industry funding model is a critical component of the government's reforms to strengthen ASIC and better protect Australian consumers. Industry funding ensures that the costs of regulation are borne by those that created the need for it rather than the Australian public. These amendments allow ASIC to better align its fees by enabling ASIC to charge a cost-reflective fee for the services it provides for a specific entity. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  The Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Amendment Bill 2018 amends the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Amendment Act 1905. The amendment means that the exceptions under section 255 of schedule 2 to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 will now apply to offences in the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905. The result of this extended application of the exceptions will be that an effective defence exists to a prosecution under the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act in a range of circumstances where the goods have substantially come from or have been made or manufactured in the country of origin which they purported to come from. This is an uncontroversial reform which essentially harmonises the laws relating to consumer protection and trade descriptions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an important principle which is supported by this reform. The bill has at its core the purpose of ensuring that businesses and people who sell goods which originated overseas provide consumers with the information they want and need in order to make informed purchasing decisions. A consumer has a right to know a range of matters which will allow them to make an informed choice about whether or not to purchase particular goods. A consumer has a right to know where their goods come from; a consumer has a right to know where the produce that was used to make the goods come from; a consumer has a right to know where the produce was grown; and a consumer has a right to know whether or not a substantial amount of the work that was undertaken to make the goods actually took place in the country where the goods are described as having come from. It is this information which is fundamental to a consumer, who should not be misled into spending money on something that is not the genuine article or for which they cannot obtain sufficient information to be assured that the provenance of the goods is what it is said to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, providing a consumer with accurate and correct information not only assists informed choice but also supports business longevity and prosperity. It's obvious that a part of getting a consumer to trust the business practices of the people and companies that they buy goods from is the availability by the business of an honest and good-faith disclosure of the country of origin for the goods the consumer is purchasing. If this good faith exists, it's likely that the consumer will trust the business or person, not only for the first transaction but for subsequent transactions. This is as important for business as it is for the consumer. If a business goes about the sale of goods in good faith, always seeking to let the consumer know what they're buying, then the business will gain a good reputation over time, becoming a trusted source for the trade they are conducting and potentially expanding the number of consumers who come to them knowing that they are buying the genuine article. It is in this light that Labor views business disclosure. It's the necessary respect cementing the relationship between businesses and consumers, who need to be informed of the provenance of the goods they're buying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, Labor accepts the need to balance the extent of the disclosure against the information that is reasonably available for businesses. An Australian business may not be able to certify to their satisfaction that all parts of a product or all the processes needed to manufacture the goods were undertaken in the represented country of origin. Given this reality, it's necessary to protect Australian businesses from unwittingly committing offences under the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905 where there is no attempt to mislead or to otherwise falsify the information being provided to an Australian consumer. Under the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905 and the associated regulations, a trade description is required to be applied to goods proposed to be imported into Australia. A trade description is also required to be placed on imported goods found in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 255 of the Australian Consumer Law is a safe-harbour provision. Its inclusion in the Australian Consumer Law was supported by Labor when the government enacted the Competition and Consumer Amendment. (Country of Origin) Act 2017. The effect of section 255 is that a person will not have committed an offence of false and misleading conduct if the facts of their conduct fall within one of the exceptions. This bill extends the exceptions so that they apply to offences in the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905. As a consequence of this bill, a person can rely on an exception in section 255 of schedule 2 of the Australian Consumer Law as a defence to a prosecution of an offence contained in the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The circumstances in which these exceptions can be applied are as follows. First, where a business or person has made a representation that goods were grown in a particular country, it is a requirement, if the business is to rely on the exception, that each significant ingredient or significant component of the goods was grown in that country; further, that all or virtually all processes involved in the production or manufacture of the goods happened in that country. Second, where there's been a representation by the business or person that goods are the produce of a particular country, the bill requires, sensibly, that the country was actually the country of origin for each significant ingredient or a significant component of the goods. Similarly, the bill requires that virtually all processes involved in the production or manufacture of the goods happened in that country. Third, the bill applies to representations that the goods were made or manufactured in a particular country and that the goods were substantially transformed in that country. These are appropriate exceptions that balance the need to provide consumers with sufficient information with the need to ensure that businesses do not unwittingly commit criminal offences which have long been on the statute books.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On a related note, I suggest to the House that measures which protect consumers will only work where consumers have enough disposable income to buy properly marked goods. Under the Turnbull government, we've seen more insecure work and cuts to penalty rates, and the government commit, time and time again, to a tax cut for the top end of town. As my colleague the shadow Treasurer has said before, the Labor Party supports tax cuts coming into force on 1 July 2018. Indeed, we'd go further and have tax cuts almost twice as big in 2019. These would give Australian consumers more money to spend on the essentials they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government decided to proceed with Labor's tax cuts rather than their handout to big business, then small businesses who sell the goods that are the subject of this bill would receive the benefits. If the government wants to see these tax cuts implemented and wants to make a difference for working Australians, then they should split the bill implementing their tax cut scheme before the Senate. They should split that bill and allow the parliament to vote separately on the tranches of proposed tax cuts: the 2018 tax cuts, which will sail through the parliament, and the 2022 and 2024 measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labour's concerns about the proposed 2024 tax cuts are well known. The Treasurer has refused to release the data relating to the year-on-year costs of the government's tax cut scheme. Labor has had to seek that information from the Parliamentary Budget Office. It shows that the 2024 proposed tax cuts grow exponentially over time and have a very, very significant cost to the budget bottom line. The Treasurer cannot tell you what the economy will be like in 2024, yet somehow he thinks he can say that the economy can afford these tax cuts. Not only is the Turnbull government unwilling to give a tax cut to those people who really need it but they are willing to lay waste to budget repair and their economic credentials in the process. They're willing to hope that in 2024, with a widening gap between the wealthiest and the poorest in this country, the economy will perform well enough under their new regressive tax plan to mean that those small- and medium-sized businesses selling goods from around the world will be able to stay trading. Labor does not believe in a regressive tax plan. Labor believes in giving relief to people doing it tough and to small- and medium-sized businesses doing it tough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians rely on a compact between business and consumers, but in order for that compact to work consumers need to have enough money to spend on goods, and businesses need to be honest and act in good faith when trading. It is in light of this compact that I note this bill does nothing to shield businesses or people who are engaging in false or misleading conduct with respect to the country of origin of the goods they are making available to the public. Labor will always stand with consumers and will always ensure that those businesses and people who wilfully seek to fraudulently or falsely mislead Australian consumers are prosecuted. This is in keeping with the fact that under Labor governments the economy prospers because we set rules that are fair, enforce rules that are broken and ensure ordinary Australians have enough to get the goods they need and help local small- and medium-sized businesses flourish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that this bill ensures coherence and harmonisation across the statute book. This is a laudable objective for our laws, and Labor supports the government's effort to ensure that there are no unintended inconsistencies in the laws governing consumer protection and trade descriptions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, on a point of indulgence, I'd like to mention that the work of the opposition on this bill was done by the former member for Perth, Mr Tim Hammond. All of us in this place were saddened by the resignation of the former member for Perth. I personally thank him for the work he did on this bill and for all the excellent work he did as a member of this House. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  It's a great pleasure to stand up and speak on this important piece of legislation, the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Amendment Bill 2018. Before I was elected—in fact, if I go all the way back to my old university days—I have always had a passion and an interest in opening up markets and advancing the cause of free and open trade. The reason is straightforward: we know that free markets and free trade are the pathway to prosperity for every society in the past, and so it forever will be in the future. No society has ever taxed itself into prosperity or aided itself into prosperity, but it has traded itself into prosperity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even this piece of legislation, which may not seem like the compelling, overarching framework of all things we need to do to advance the cause of free and open markets across the world, is nonetheless yet another brick in the bridge we are trying to build to try to increase the amount of free-flowing goods and services between our great nation and those who seek to engage with us. Free-flowing goods and services have been and always will be responsible for the wealth of this country. We have always been a nation that cannot consume everything that it produces. If we want to see an advancement in our material prosperity and the material prosperity of so many other countries we engage with, we need more traffic on our international trade highways, not less.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To make sure that we have that advancement of free and open markets and trade, we need rules and standards which are universally understood and which minimise the behind-the-border obligations and regulations which can undermine the capacity for business to get on with it, for enterprises to get on with it and for entrepreneurs seeking to build standards, products, goods and services that they can trade across the global marketplace to get on with it. The lesser the regulation, always the better. The more consistency and harmonisation between standards, the better, because it removes an obstacle and a barrier. If there's one truth, it's that, if you have more complex regulation, like more complex tax, all it does is favour established interests, as people seek to use and manipulate those regulations or taxations in their interest, and burden those people who are merely starting out, trying to get their fair share and their fair go. That's why this piece of legislation is important; it seeks to achieve that harmonisation and remove unnecessary barriers that sit at the heart of our economy for those people who want to export.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need more competition for goods and services domestically, but, more critically, we need more competition for goods and services globally, not higher restrictions on our importers and our exporters. We need to rebuild, frankly, Australia's free trade consensus. I'm sure many people in this chamber have watched as that free trade consensus that was built after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War has become tested and challenged by countries that now seek to impose tariffs and regulations on other nations for exporting basic goods and value-added goods like steel. And that risks a global trade war, because we know that, when you see countries resort to protectionist measures, whether it's by simple tariffs, quotas or regulations, countries will eventually respond in kind, and every person on this planet will end up paying more for less. They will have a reduced standard of living. They will see costs and obligations shifted upon them by those political masters who only seek to buy votes in advancement of the interests of their constituencies but at the expense of living standards and always at the greatest expense of the poor. Anything we can do to undermine that cause and that crusade by those people who seek to use trade to their political advantage is worthy and just.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That returns us to this bill and its potential and objectives. Even at a basic administrative level, it is one of the bricks for building the bridge of an international free trade highway. We need to rebuild consensus for that free trade highway. If we do, the principal beneficiary will be the Australian consumer, and that includes real people living across this great continent who seek merely to achieve the highest standard of living that's available to them. It's the family of four who are always looking for good deals in supermarkets and shopping centres and don't want to pay overly inflated prices, carrying the cost of tax, regulation, tariffs and other measures. It's those people who are vulnerable and just trying to get ahead. It's the student who's starting out and having their first kick at life, living away from home and trying to live a happy, healthy lifestyle on a tight household budget. They are the victims of protectionism. Just like single-income families who are feeling the cost-of-living pressures firm on their shoulders as they manage the great costs in their life, not just managing housing stress, whether it's rental or mortgage stress, but the costs of energy and electricity. And, let's face it, our political opponents are doing little to help us try and reduce those prices, but let's get past that. There's also the burden and cost of education and the burden and cost of making sure people can afford basic staples and supplies to feed and clothe their family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you increase regulations and barriers, they are the costs that go up—those that are most sensitive, those things that are produced by people in other parts of the world where Australia does not have a comparative advantage, where we are not competitive and rely on the ingenuity and the capacity of other nations. But, let's face it, even if we increase those costs and they don't go directly to the household, in the end they become costs that burden businesses in Australia that seek to be competitive in a global marketplace. At every step, at every stage, they suffer the consequences, whether it's the family of four, the student, the single-income family or the pensioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No matter who has a tight budget, protectionism only rewards one group of people: the established interests and those who are rich and powerful. That is why, as a Liberal, I will always defend a freer, more open market economy and freer and more open trade. It is people who are seeking a sense of opportunity in society that we must always stand up for. The more we empower those people to export and import across boundaries and barriers, the more we empower those people to live better lives. And the more we empower importers to change the status quo, the more we drive competition. Too many people in trade policy are only interested in focusing on exports, because they think that is the only way to achieve prosperity, without recognising the important power that drives competition in domestic economies. Australia is a great emblem across the world for delivering. We cannot produce everything ourselves but what we do produce we do well and we sell in the global marketplace with a premium. But when we import things it value-adds and contributes to the development of our domestic industry to be competitive across the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to see cheaper prices for goods, as well as protecting consumers against misleading information about where something is made. It is about clarity and transparency so people can make those informed decisions. This bill forms part of the government's broader reform of country-of-origin labelling. Labelling information gives consumers protection against misleading and deceptive conduct. Regulation governing these rules should be the same for imported and domestic goods. It is about harmonisation, it is about informing consumers and it is about making sure that behind-the-border measures aren't acting as a sneaky or tricky way to not only confuse consumers but also add costs onto the Australian consumer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore it makes sense to ensure that there is consistency between the Competition and Consumer Act and the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act. The bill would have the effect of providing a defence for importers who get caught up in the importation of goods with a false description. The alignment between the two acts will reduce the complexity of enforcing origin marking requirements at the border, allowing Australian Border Force to focus compliance activities on goods that don't meet the safe harbour defences. In short, this bill gives our importers the freedom to make a claim about the origin of their goods similar to those permitted under the Australian consumer law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill isn't just a brick in the bridge to advance a free trade international superhighway. It is a bill that seeks to reinforce Australia's existing commitment to free and open markets and trade and say to the average Australian that they should pay no more than necessary for those basic consumer goods that they enjoy, particularly those that are most sensitive to prices and which most dramatically are consumed by average Australian households, the vulnerable and those on fixed incomes, and that is food. And that's the basis on which I support this bill.</span>

As we just heard, this bill is another example of our government's strong commitment to open trade, to the value of trade and to the impact that trade has had on this wonderful country. Over the last several hundred years it has been central to our success as a nation. This bill is one of many initiatives the government is pursuing, alongside the free trade agreements, to ensure that we remain a successful trading nation with a minimum of red tape, a minimum of intervention from government, in achieving that great goal of more trade, higher standards of living, greater investment and more jobs—all those things that come with an open trading economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill enables officers of Australian Border Force to take into account the safe harbour defences set out in the Australian Consumer Law when assessing country-of-origin claims on imported goods. The bill also provides a head of power to enable the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Regulation 2016 to be amended to incorporate information standards made or declared under the Australian consumer law that are in force or existing from time to time. The amendments in this bill will ensure that businesses are provided with certainty that their country-of-origin claims are compliant with labelling requirements. The bill also establishes prohibitions against misleading country-of-origin representations whether they are importing the goods or selling them in Australia. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  Here we have yet another Liberal bill designed to clear up a mess of the Liberals' own making. You would be forgiven for thinking that's all this government does when it comes to health—clean up messes of its own making. That seems to have been the minister's No. 1 preoccupation over the last 18 months, desperately trying to right some of the egregious wrongs perpetrated by his two Liberal predecessors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Health Insurance (Approved Pathology Specimen Collection Centres) Tax Amendment Bill 2018 amends the Health Insurance (Approved Pathology Specimen Collection Centres) Tax Act 2000—I will call it the 'pathology tax act'—to change the frequency of the tax paid by approved pathology collection centres. Presently, each of Australia's roughly 6,000 collection centres pay a tax of $1,000 when they're first approved and then when their approval is renewed each year. Under this bill, collection centres will pay a tax of $2,000 every two years instead of $1,000 every year. There is a big debate to be had about that, apparently. This is intended to reduce regulatory burden for the government and industry while maintaining the revenue raised by the tax. The rate of the tax has not been increased since it was first introduced in 1999, and the government argues there should be no increase in tax at this time, to ensure that smaller providers are not negativity impacted. I note that, in fact, there has been substantial consolidation in pathology over the course of the last few years. Now only three per cent of the pathology industry is made up of smaller pathology providers and, increasingly, they are being swallowed up by the larger pathology providers, and the market has become very, very concentrated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also asked the Department of Health to tell me how much is raised each year by the pathology tax. We think it is around $6 million but it would be good if the minister, in summing up, could actually clarify that. It is a question we did ask of the department. I also ask the Department of Human Services what the cost is of actually administering this taxation system and the value of the reduced regulatory burden to government and industry. I haven't been given any answers to those questions yet and I would expect the minister, in his summation, to be able to do so. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of that in the bill sounds fair enough. Regulatory burden changes are fairly minor changes, and Labor of course will support the passage of these bills through this place and in the other place. Although I note the fact that the tax has not been increased for some 18 years—it hasn't been indexed, as I understand it—is pretty surprising. It is a very small amount of money paid compared to the profits of the large providers that now dominate this pathology sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's look at the real reason the government is having to introduce this bill. This is damage control. It's clearing the decks before the next election. I've said it before and I'll say it again: the government has spent the lion's share of its second term in health cleaning up the messes it made in its first, and this bill is a classic example of that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This issue goes back to 2009, when Labor first introduced bulk-billing incentives for pathology and diagnostic-imaging services. These incentives were an additional payment made to providers who chose to bulk bill their patients in an out-of-hospital setting so patients would not face out-of-pocket costs. It came about at a time when Labor was making sensible savings to pathology rebates, but we wanted to ensure that, at the same time as we were making those savings to be reinvested in health and health areas, those savings did not have an impact on patients. It was a sensible policy, and it worked. By 2014-15, of the 104.3 million pathology services provided out of hospital, almost all of them—98.7 per cent—were done at no cost to the patient. In fact, the percentage of bulk billing actually increased in pathology as a result of the bulk-billing incentive. In diagnostic imaging, it increased by 10 per cent in just six years thanks to those bulk-billing incentives. As Michael Gannon, the now former president of the AMA, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At a time when Medicare rebates for pathology and diagnostic imaging services have been frozen for more than a decade, the bulk billing incentives have been vital in ensuring that all patients can have ready access to these services, regardless of their financial circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what did the brains trust over on the other side decide to do? What they always do in the Health portfolio: they basically decided that they were going to get rid of this bulk-billing incentive. Not long after the Prime Minister took over the top job, the Liberals delivered their Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and, having learnt nothing from the public backlash to their substantial previous health cuts, they decided in MYEFO to go at health again. One of the most significant cuts was to Labor's bulk-billing incentives in a bid to save some $650 million. This was back in the days before the 2016 election, when the Liberals didn't even try to hide their cuts, and there was no commitment to reinvest any of that money in the Health portfolio; rather, the money was going to fund other policy priorities, not in health at all. Frankly, health is always this government's last priority. After all, they'd rather give big business an $80 billion tax cut than properly fund our hospitals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The announcement came as a shock to many, particularly given that the government's review of Medicare services was still underway at the time—and is still underway to this date—and pathology had not even started to be looked at yet. Why pre-empt such a major review by making such a major change to the Medicare Benefits Schedule in this way? That's the problem with this government. With every measure this government takes, they just use blunt instruments without thinking them through—without consulting or negotiating, they just announce them—and, at the end of the day, it is patients who suffer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This announcement also pre-empted the expiration of the July 2016 five-year agreement between the pathology sector and government, a document which governed arrangements around Medicare-funded pathology and something the Liberal Party said that it would support. The then Minister for Health, the member for Farrer, argued that bulk-billing incentives for pathology were no longer needed because the sector was naturally very competitive. We on this side knew that these changes would directly hurt patients, forcing out-of-pocket costs even higher. Obviously, the pathologists were always going to pass those costs on to patients. Even worse, it would force some people to delay getting tests, putting their lives at risk. So we did what Labor always does when the Liberals try to cut from our health system: we fought back, vowing to use every mechanism we could to kill off this measure in the Senate. The sector fought back too. Describing it as a co-payment by stealth, the AMA warned that the move would hit the poorest and sickest the hardest. But when has this government ever cared about those people? They only care about the people they want to give an $80 billion tax cut to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Gannon said the evidence showed that many patients, particularly the sickest and most vulnerable, deferred seeking treatments because of cost, exacerbating their pain and suffering and ultimately adding to the nation's overall health bill. The peak group Pathology Australia warned that not only would bulk-billing rates fall but that some pathology collection centres would be forced to close, including those in rural and regional areas and in hospitals. The sector's Don't Kill Bulk Bill campaign gave us the immortal image of the member for Farrer dressed as Uma Thurman's sword-wielding bride from Quentin Tarantino's film. I thought she pulled that look off quite nicely, but that campaign also delivered a petition of 600,000 signatures, showing once again that the Australian people were deadset against this government's health cuts and that they were just not going to tolerate it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This campaign clearly gave the Prime Minister quite a fright. The campaign went on for a while, with 600,000 signatures collected across the country, but the next thing you knew was that the Prime Minister was standing up in the first leaders debate with the Leader of the Opposition, suddenly announcing that he'd struck a deal with the pathology sector in a bid to shut them up for the rest of the campaign. That was all that was about. It was a shameless and cynical stunt to get his government through the election. It was the move of a desperate Prime Minister, committed to funding cuts but praying that the Australian people wouldn't find out about them. It was a dodgy deal, probably scrawled on the back of an envelope or napkin somewhere. Pathologists, however, accepted the abolition of bulk-billing incentives in exchange for a government pledge to regulate the rents that pathologists paid GPs to co-locate in their practices. 'Deal done,' the government thought. 'Problem solved. We've got them to be quiet during the election campaign. All good.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, not so fast. We knew, the minute that was announced, that the government had not told the truth. We knew that GPs would be furious about it, many of them having already based their business cases on those rents. The two largest pathology companies attempted to outbid each other, trying to get themselves into collection centres in practices, particularly in areas where lots of pathology treatments were available. They were outbidding each other. They had bid the rents up so high and then complained about them, getting the government to agree, despite the fact that GPs had put their entire business case on the basis of this income—many expanding their practices substantially—and suddenly that was going to be done over. You have to be kidding! We absolutely knew the government had no intention to deliver—nor could it actually deliver—on that promise. GPs were absolutely furious. So in the government's hasty attempt to buy the silence of the pathology sector, it made enemies of the family doctors across the country. Terrific. A genius move.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government was already at war with GPs after its attempt to increase the $7 co-payment and then freeze the Medicare rebates. At least in that sense the government is consistent. It can't help picking fights with the medical profession. As the AMA pointed out, the rents deal plunged GPs across the country into uncertainty about an important element of their business. Many of the practices that leased space to pathologists are small businesses that negotiated leases in good faith with larger multinational pathology providers. They made business decisions based on projected rental streams, including investment in infrastructure and staffing which helped to keep them viable. The AMA's Michael Gannon said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">GPs are sick of being told by politicians on both sides that they are highly valued, but then hit with Government policy that consistently hurts practice viability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I doubt that the government truly contemplated the extent of the impact of its election commitment when it was announced. This is, frankly, typical of this government's approach when it comes to health: half-baked ideas and unnecessary cuts followed eventually by the inevitable humiliating backflip. The government capitulated again, using its 2017 budget to break its deal with pathologists to reverse its cuts to bulk-billing. In fact, gallingly, the minister keeps saying, 'We've invested with this new $650 million in pathology and diagnostic imaging.' You've reversed your own cuts—that's what you've done—and ditched the rent regulation plan. As I said, it backflipped on the $650 million of cuts that set off this whole sorry saga in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is one of a number of policy changes that the government has offered the pathology sector by way, frankly, of a grovelling apology. No stakeholder in health should trust this government when it says that it's doing a deal. That is the lesson that Pathology Australia, the Diagnostic Imaging Association and GPs across the country should read from what we've seen in this bill.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is not about health policy; it is a dispute resolution. As I said at the start of this speech, that is pretty much all you see from this government in health: no vision about the health of this nation; no vision about the development and future needs of the healthcare sector in this nation; and no strategy—just constantly having to clean up mess after mess after mess. While Labor will be supporting this bill, it's important for the record to reflect the real reasons that this bill has in fact been brought before this parliament. I move the second reading amendment that's been circulated in my name:</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  In rising to speak on the Health Insurance (Approved Pathology Specimen Collection Centres) Tax Amendment Bill 2018, I congratulate the member for Ballarat for well summarising our concerns about this legislation. I fully support her amendment and agree with her comments. I rise today to speak on this bill, which we will not be opposing. However, in line with the amendment, it is critical to condemn this government's attack on pathology bulk-billing at the previous election and consequential election deal around rent control that overwhelmingly favoured corporate pathology giants and left the small pathology centres out to dry. This really does demonstrate this government's lack of ability to understand health care in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I started my private practice in 1984, the year that the Hawke Labor government introduced Medicare. My practice was founded on the benefits that Medicare gave to our population in terms of health care. Unfortunately, this government has continued its thousand cuts to the Medicare system. The government rails against Labor's campaign supporting Medicare in the last election, but, really, this is just further evidence of how little this government understands health care in this country and further evidence of its continued attacks on the health care of people who really struggle to meet the current costs of health care in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has done many, many things, even in the short two-year period since the 2016 election. One thing that was of grave concern to me was the sell-off of the Australian cancer registry, which this government quite happily did very surreptitiously, without much fanfare at the beginning of our term in parliament. It was a real shame and something that we will, I think, live to rue in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're constantly talking about cuts and freezes on bulk-billing rates, cuts to hospitals and difficulty accessing specialty health care. That's because this government has a real ideological problem in that it doesn't really understand a fair, accessible and equitable universal healthcare system. There have been many, many things that have demonstrated this in the past and even in the last two years since the 2016 election. In my own electorate, I have seen cuts to our hospital services and cutbacks in our GP after-hours service—in fact, the removal of the GP after-hours service co-located at the main hospital in my electorate, Campbelltown Hospital. That was a real shame for this provider of health care in the Macarthur electorate—and, again, something that happened very surreptitiously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, I repeat, ideologically does not believe in a fair, accessible and equitable health system. In the government's 2015 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, it listed the changes to diagnostic imaging and pathology bulk-billing services incentives and said, 'The savings from this measure will be redirected by the government to repair the budget and fund policy priorities'—again, attacking the healthcare system for other priorities. I'm not sure what policy priorities are more important than providing equitable healthcare services, such as bulk-billed pathology testing, but, after campaigning by Pathologies Australia, the government did not reverse the cuts and instead cut a rent deal that allowed the pathology companies to get cheaper rent for collection centres located in GP clinics. In exchange, these companies would stop campaigning against the coalition, which is a real sign to me that this government is prepared to support its big business mates at the expense of equitable health care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important also to remember that when we talk about pathology companies, we are talking about multibillion-dollar companies that have a monopoly over the sector and have squeezed out smaller independent pathology centres. The government have done very little to look at other alternatives to widen the pathology network but have concentrated on their big business partners. The only reason the government backed down was the fear of these companies campaigning against them and the electoral backlash. In return, these pathology companies agreed, even with the cuts to the bulk-billing incentives remaining, to stop any negative campaigning against the coalition—the coalition protect their big business mates; their big business mates protect the coalition. This is a poor deal for the general public, for the smaller healthcare providers and for the GPs in particular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's blatantly clear about the deal is the lack of consideration for the patients or the GPs. In fact, the Department of Health said that there was no evidence that rents pathology companies were being charged were above market value. Many GPs had formed their businesses based on the rents they were going to receive from the pathology companies, but the screws were put on them at the expense of their patients and the GPs to the benefit of the pathology companies. This was a deal the coalition made with the big end of town, with no consideration for the Australian public. This should not be a surprise to any of us, because this government only govern for their mates and not for the general population. We've seen this just recently with the government constantly giving in to the big media players, their mates, against the ABC, and we continue to see the government's persistent attempts to enact tax cuts for big business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABC issue is very important to me because the ABC provides services to all Australians. It provides wonderful access, particularly in rural and remote areas, yet the government is prepared to campaign with thousands and thousands of dollars cut from the ABC budget at the expense of the ABC and to the benefit of the major media players—again, big business benefitting at the expense of ordinary Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor fought off the proposed introduction of the GP co-payment. We all remember that from the Abbott government proposal and how pathetic the attacks on equitable health care were. Now we see this government consistently chipping away at funding for hospitals, chipping away at bulk-billing incentives and delaying the lift on the freeze on bulk-billing payments to GPs and others. In fact, the recent budget introduced a miserly increase in GP payments, really quite derisory, and yet they continue to support big business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's critical to understand is that this, as I said, is an ideological battle. The coalition just doesn't believe in a fully accessible universal healthcare system. I would like to refer to the recent <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program that looked at access to health care. I have seen evidence of this in this my electorate and, indeed, amongst my own patients. There is now an increase in gap payments required to visit specialists. This really is across the board, but there are some specific procedural specialties that continue to charge increasing gap payments to the point where many people cannot afford access to specialist care. A visit to a specialist cardiologist in my electorate can cost a patient out-of-pocket expenses, over and above the Medicare rebates, of $500 or more, and this has put access to specialist cardiologist services out of the reach of many of the poorest in my community. This is an absolute tragedy. The major hospital in my electorate does not have an easily accessible outpatient clinic for cardiology patients. So, in fact, many elderly people, often on pensions, are being excluded from specialist care. We are seeing an increase in the inequity in health care to the point where we are rapidly developing a two-tiered healthcare system, and this is a great shame. This is not the sort of healthcare system that I was brought up to believe in. I really think that the government should look at itself, look at its policies and see what it's doing to health care in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said before that we are heading down the path to a two-tiered system, and I want to see some action to ensure that our healthcare system does not rival that of the United States where, effectively, only the wealthy can access quality care. With the government and industry putting profit before patients, I just cannot stress enough how much we are at risk of heading in this direction. This is a philosophical problem that the coalition has; it just does not understand equitable health care. We need to be doing more to make sure that we hold this government to task.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be part of the party that created Medicare. I'm proud that I've been through the introduction of Medibank, introduced by the Whitlam Labor government when I was a medical student. It was really destroyed by the Fraser Liberal government. Medicare was reintroduced by the Hawke government and promoted by the Gillard and Rudd Labor governments, but is now facing a thousand cuts by this Liberal coalition government. I want to ensure equal access to health care for all Australians, not just those who have a credit card and money in the bank. It's really unknown to me why conservative members of this place are intent on attacking this ideal. I thought this was something that everyone in this place supported—equitable access to health care for all Australians—but by the actions of this government, clearly not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really think that equitable access to health care has become part of who we are. The general population believe in it; we've seen how they respond when there are attacks on Medicare. We have called out this tirade of attacks time and time again, and yet those opposite continue to chip away and chip away at the fabric of a healthcare system that's provided equitable access to most Australians—nearly all Australians—for over 30 years. Unless we continue to identify and call out the more subtle moves by those opposite to undermine our health system, we'll find ourselves before long adopting this two-tiered system, which they seem to want, without even realising how we got there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout my professional career, prior to being elected, I witnessed respective Liberal coalition governments trying to eat away at the framework of our universal healthcare system. A change that may lead to different individuals paying different rates for their premiums may not seem that dramatic, and certainly will not have the effect of closing hospitals overnight. However, subtle changes over time, such as these to private health insurance rates, are far more significant than many members can understand. Eroding the level and quality of care all Australians have a right to is not something that we want to see.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program, as I mentioned, released its investigation, stating that out-of-pocket costs are totally out of control. My own profession has some responsibility for this. We are seeing more and more patients having to pay larger and larger out-of-pocket expenses, now to the point where many people cannot afford quality care. It is becoming harder and harder to find a specialist that bulk bills and the costs to patients are constantly increasing. Out-of-pocket costs to patients vary significantly from rural and remote areas to inner city areas to outer suburban areas. Sometimes there are differentials of 100 or 200 per cent between what doctors in the same field charge. Many people in the more disadvantaged areas are, interestingly, often those being asked to pay the larger gap payments. It's a shame that those who are most disadvantaged are being disadvantaged even further by our healthcare system. While the majority of Australians still have access to bulk-billing GPs, it is incredibly hard to find a bulk-billing specialist in the country. And when you do find a specialist that bulk bills, you may be waiting months and months for appointments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Medicare is founded on the notion of ensuring equality of access to health care for all Australians. I will always call out threats to that when I see them, and I see big threats from this government chipping away at what is equitable care. We need to stop playing games with the healthcare system. We need someone on the government benches to stand up for equal access to health care across the board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I'm looking for political causes, I always find following the money interesting. When you look at the share price of some of our biggest pathology companies and healthcare providers, you find that the share price of the biggest provider of pathology services in Australia has increased by 15 per cent in the last 12 months. I think that's a very good sign of what has been happening: big business has been benefitting from the government's policies on health care. It is a real shame that that benefit is at the expense of those most disadvantaged. We need to support our general practitioners, we need to support our most disadvantaged to have access to health care and we need to make access to specialist care much more equitable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this government is doing is trying to chip away at a system that has provided wonderful healthcare support for all Australians for over 30 years. The government has been called out time and time again. It is no good their standing up and saying, 'We support Medicare,' when we know they don't. We know they don't support equality and equity of access, and that is a shame. Whilst we support the bill, the amendment is very important and it should be passed. I fully support the shadow health minister. I really despair of what this government is doing to health care and I want it to change.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  I rise to follow on from my colleague the member for Macarthur. I acknowledge his lifetime commitment to health and quality health care for the people of the electorate that he represents and the wider Sydney community. I thank him for his contribution, which covered details of the bill but also came from a very personal point of view, and his great understanding of the health sector. As one of the few GPs to have served in this parliament, he knows what he's talking about. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker Irons, perhaps I could say to the government that they might start taking lessons from health professionals. They might start taking professional lessons from those who know what they're talking about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise tonight to speak on the Health Insurance (Approved Pathology Specimen Collection Centres) Tax Amendment Bill 2018 and also to strongly support the second reading amendment of the shadow health minister. If there ever were a shining example of the hypocrisy of the government, this is it. Whilst, as we've heard, Labor supports the bill, which will make life easier for approved pathology collection centres, it cannot be lost on the House how this government gives a little with one hand but takes away a lot with the other. It's what they do about properly funding our schools, it's what they do with our hospitals, it's what they do with aged care—as we debated in this place today—and it's what they do with providing affordable and accessible health care for Australians. We, on this side of the chamber, know that, when it comes to dealing with health, health reform and health services in this country, the Turnbull government cannot be trusted. Unfortunately, Pathology Australia found this out the hard way in 2017, when pathologists accepted the abolition of bulk-billing incentives in exchange for reregulation of the rents that pathologists pay GPs to co-locate in their practices, only to have the government break this promise in the second half of 2017. It was promising on one hand while taking away with the other, which is hardly surprising, coming from a party that said there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education and no cuts to the ABC or SBS, when, in truth, we know those opposite would actually cut the funding from all of the above.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time when Pathology Australia launched their Don't Kill Bulk Bill campaign in 2016, Chief Executive Officer Liesel Wett said that the sector had provided savings to the government for many years but could not continue to absorb further cuts and that the proposed unfair cuts would see patients having to pay for services from July. The CEO said at the time:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We want to make sure patients don't miss out on getting their pap smears and their life-saving blood tests, but the proposed $650 million in cuts to pathology and diagnostic imaging simply cannot be absorbed by the sector …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's exactly what the government did, and we know that is true to form. Rather than supporting and investing in our healthcare system, all they seem to do is cut. Here we have the national peak body for private pathology in Australia coming to terms with the government for what they thought was an acceptable outcome, only for the government then to pull the rug out from underneath them and renege on the deal. It is little wonder that the people of Australia have lost faith in the government when it can't even stick to the promises it makes with organisations like Pathology Australia, which provides high-quality, affordable, safe and accessible pathology services to all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned at the start, when the government does give a little bit with one hand, they take away a lot with the other. This was easy to see when the government announced its modest Medicare rebate in last year's budget. While they wanted to be rewarded and congratulated on their supposed thaw, the facts told a completely different story. The Medicare rebate thaw did not apply to 93 per cent of scans, including X-rays, MRIs and ultrasounds used to diagnose some of the most common forms of cancer, and was only lifted on 59 of the 891 radiology items listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule. That's just seven items. While mammograms and a number of CT scans were indexed under the plan, X-rays, MRIs and ultrasounds for such common conditions as brain, lung, breast and ovarian cancers were not. The rebate on common scans for arthritis and nuclear medicine also remained frozen. The government gave a little with one hand and took away an awful lot with the other. Just ask any of the 100,000 Australians who, as we heard today in this chamber, are waiting for an appropriate home care package. There is no Medicare guarantee under this government and there never will be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a former member for Oxley, Bill Hayden, who built and delivered Medicare. The great Bill Hayden first delivered universal health care for this country. In 1973, during his second reading speech on the health insurance bill to introduce Medibank as it was called at the time—and I might add that it was opposed violently by those opposite—Mr Hayden said it was to provide 'the most equitable and efficient means of providing health insurance coverage for all Australians'. It was introduced by Labor and it was opposed by the Liberal Party then. It was not just for the wealthy, not just for the few, but for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast with those opposite is a very different story. The cost of going to a GP is up, the cost of private health insurance is going up, the cost of radiology is going up and the cost of seeking specialist medical care is going up. For example, earlier this year when the health minister announced another rise in private health insurance premiums, the health funds would have average weighted increases in premiums of 3.9 per cent from 1 April 2018. Thousands of private health insurance customers have seen their premiums soar well over the 3.9 per cent average increase, with figures showing that more than a dozen policies have jumped by double-digit figures. So we know that the cost of health care under this government is getting harder and harder for people to afford.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, under this government, there was an increase of 4.84 per cent in premiums. The year before, it was 5.59 per cent. In 2015 it was 6.18 per cent and in 2014 it was 6.2 per cent. The costs of health care continue to rise and access to health care continues to be difficult for many Australians. Out-of-pocket costs are soaring, with hospital patients now paying around $300 per service. Not surprisingly, the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman has revealed that there were almost 10,000 complaints in the last year, almost twice as many as in 2013.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Oxley, just over 90,000 people hold private health insurance and they would like to see a better deal than what is being put forward by the government. In contrast, under Bill Shorten, Labor has made the unprecedented decision to cut the price increases of private health insurers at two per cent each year, for two years, delivering premium relief and budget certainty to Australians. Families in my electorate will benefit under a Shorten Labor government. Further, a Shorten Labor government would invest more in every single public hospital in the country, with an extra $2.8 billion in funding for more beds and shorter surgery waiting times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to life-saving scans, this side of the chamber will deliver more affordable health care and greater access to it for more communities, by expanding Medicare to subsidise access to diagnostic imaging in areas where there are shortages. This means investing $80 million to boost the number of eligible MRI machines and to approve 20 new licences. That will mean 500,000 more scans funded by Medicare over the course of a first Labor budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, it's clear to say that the Australian people do have a choice when it comes to providing affordable and accessible health care. As I said in my opening remarks, whilst we won't be opposing this bill, I do want to place on record that, time and time again, when it comes to health reform and these bills before the parliament, we constantly see the government give a little with one hand but take a lot more with the other hand. I once again say to the government: start listening to the professionals; start listening to the experts. They're the people who are wonderful frontline workers, frontline nurses and all of those great clinicians, particularly in my home state of Queensland, who go beyond the call of duty day in, day out—just like the member for Macarthur did in his professional career before entering public life. This government could take a lesson out of those doctors' books and start listening to the professionals to provide better, more affordable health care for all Australians.</span>

                    <a href="DZP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BIRD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:15</span>):  I indicate to the House that I rise to support the amendment moved by the shadow minister. The bill before us, of course, is the Health Insurance (Approved Pathology Specimen Collection Centres) Tax Amendment Bill 2018. It's intended to change the frequency of the tax paid by approved pathology collection centres, known as ACCs. At present, each of Australia's 5,500 to 6,000 ACCs pay a tax of $1,000 when approved. That has to be renewed each year. Under this bill, they'll pay a tax of $2,000 every two years instead. The intention of the bill is to reduce the regulatory burden for government and industry and to maintain the revenue raised from the tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, as the shadow minister outlined, the bill sits within a range of developments that have occurred since the 2015-16 MYEFO. At that time, the government sought to cut $650 million from Medicare bulk-billing incentives for pathology and diagnostic imaging, including abolishing incentives for pathology. The peak body, Pathology Australia, commenced a serious and major campaign against those cuts. It was called the Don't Kill Bulk Bill campaign. That particular campaign included a petition which attracted over 600,000 signatures. As a result of this campaign, during the 2016 election campaign the government reached a settlement with Pathology Australia. Pathologists accepted the abolition of bulk-billing incentives in exchange for re-regulation of the rents that pathologists pay to GPs to co-locate in their practices. However, GP opposition to the changes forced the government to break that deal in the 2017 budget. This bill is one of a number of policy changes that the government has offered to the pathology sector in return. The amendment moved by the shadow minister reflects the problems that have led to this position, whilst not denying the bill a second reading.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In speaking to this bill and the health insurance industry, I just want to touch on some of the concerns that have been raised by my local constituents. In February this year, I did one of my costs-of-living surveys and had over 1,000 locals respond to that survey. Over 80 per cent of them indicated that they'd had no real increase in their pay or, indeed, had had a reduction in their pay over the last three years; 45 per cent of them said that their doctor and specialist visits put increased pressure on their budgets; 33 per cent said pharmaceuticals put an increased pressure on their family budget; and 67 per cent said that private health insurance costs put increased pressure on the family budget. Of those who responded, over 70 per cent of people said they found it difficult to make their income stretch over their pay week, fortnight or month. Over 70 per cent are struggling with the cost of living, and a significant proportion of those indicated that health costs were an important contributor to that struggle. Over 70 per cent of those who responded felt that private health insurance was not good value. I'll just repeat that: over 70 per cent—over a thousand people, just in my electorate—indicated that they did not feel they were getting good value for money with their private health insurance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only did people respond to the question, but I invited them, in an open section of the survey, to make comments on their experience and why this was an issue for them, and I want to share some of those comments because they go to the very issues in the health insurance debate and the issues that have led to this bill. They reflect very much the experience of locals in this space. I'll just use people's first names, to respect their privacy. The response was enormous. In the surveys I received back, there were almost none where people did not take the opportunity to give me some direct, written feedback on what their experience of health insurance has been.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It costs our family nearly $300 a month for hospital and extras cover. The extras cover goes towards necessary health care—dentist, optical and physiotherapy—to keep us well and functional. However, the amount paid out by insurers against those premiums is pitiful and often a couple of extra visits to a physio for an injury will be the difference between making it from pay to pay with some money left in the bank and having to use our credit card to cover necessary costs like groceries etc. Since we are generally healthy, we rarely use the hospital cover. However, we are scared to drop the cover because of the penalties imposed both under the tax system and by the Lifetime Health Cover penalty should we want to take up cover later in life.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about health insurance and the private health insurance system, we have to recognise that, while profits are up each year for the private health insurance industry—the latest official data showing that they were getting $3.7 billion more than they were paying out in benefits—there are many, many people in our community who not only feel that it's not good value for money but also are very frustrated by the fact they feel they can't give it up but they're not getting a fair go under what they get back. As many of those commenters from my survey said, the premiums continue to rise while the benefits don't seem to be improving at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is important to acknowledge within this health insurance debate that Labor have made it clear that we want to tackle this problem. It's very important that we realise that this is a real cost-of-living pressure on families. It's no wonder that many of them, as reflected by my constituents, are considering dropping their cover. Indeed, nearly 12,000 people dropped their hospital insurance in the last three months of last year. So it is something that needs serious attention. That is why Labor have said that we will cap premium price increases at two per cent for two years, which will deliver families an average saving of $340, and shift the balance of power back in favour of consumers rather than private insurance companies. As part of that, we will also task the Productivity Commission with a sweeping review to identify long-term, sustainable ways to bring down costs and improve quality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we debate this bill today, another in a range of bills dealing with health insurance and the private health insurance industry, I think it is very important to listen to the voices of the people in our community. I'm sure that colleagues, not only on this side but right across the House, will have heard when they talk to their local communities that people are finding carrying the costs of their private health insurance increasingly problematic. They've had stagnant wages and their cost of living keeps going up. When the cost of health is going up as well, as many of those comments I've just read out indicate, people, sadly in some cases, don't follow through on their health purchases—purchasing pharmaceuticals, having pathology tests, going to see the specialists as they are required to do—and that has very serious health implications. Also, there are people who are doing those things and paying those costs and then finding that they don't have money for groceries, or they are putting things on the credit card that they shouldn't be and are getting themselves in more financial difficulty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that it is very, very important that we understand that health insurance—not only in this bill as it affects providers, such as pathology providers, but across the board—has real implications for real families in our communities. Government needs to get serious on getting much more effective action on addressing those costs and the gap between what people are paying and the services that they feel they're reasonably receiving. I commend the amendment moved by the shadow minister. I think it is very pertinent to the health insurance debate that we acknowledge the context within which we debate it tonight.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:30</span>):  Deputy Speaker Kevin Andrews, as much as it is always a delight to have you present in the chair, I do confess to a moment of sadness, because I had made a promise to the previous Deputy Speaker who was there, Mr Irons. The promise was that I would spend at least one minute talking about the Health Insurance (Approved Pathology Specimen Collection Centres) Tax Amendment Bill 2018 itself before moving on to the second reading amendment—but I'll still keep the promise.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's fair to say that this is not a riveting bill. You wouldn't classify this as groundbreaking reform that's going to improve the health system in any meaningful way. Indeed, despite the government's claims, I suspect that—when they finally get around to answering some of the questions put to them by the shadow minister, if they can—it's probably not going to do much towards reducing the regulatory burden for government and industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill amends the Health Insurance (Approved Pathology Specimen Collection Centres) Tax Act 2000 to change the frequency of how often people pay this tax. Currently, you pay $1,000 every year if you're a particular kind of pathology business. In a moment of brilliance, the health minister took a bit of time out from yelling at grandmas and came up with the idea that you would pay a tax of $2,000 every two years. It's a little bit less paperwork for the same amount of revenue, so that's pretty good. As I said, it is intended to reduce regulatory burden for government industry while maintaining revenue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister has asked some questions. 'How much do you raise?' Don't know; still waiting for an answer. 'What's the cost to the Department of Human Services for administering this approvals and renewals system?' Don't know; still waiting for an answer. As I said, we're still waiting to hear what the supposed reduction in regulatory burden is actually costed at. That will be of great excitement to the Australian people and the parliament, no doubt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having acquitted my promise to the previous Deputy Speaker with honour, I turn now to the second reading amendment, which condemns the government for their attack on pathology and for their desperate pre-election deal with Pathology Australia, which they then shamelessly ratted on. They ran away from it, realising that it was a stupid idea, and then created an even bigger mess when the GPs rounded on them. They thought: 'Panic! Panic! Well, let's rat on that deal and we'll go and make a different mess over here.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do need to retrace history. In the 2015-16 mid-year financial update, the government announced out of the blue that they were cutting $650 million from Medicare bulk-billing incentives for pathology and diagnostic imaging, including the incentives for pathology. Now, I was a candidate running for parliament then, and I remember starting to pick this up when I was visiting businesses and talking with local people through the media and in the community. The campaign started by Pathology Australia was called Don't Kill Bulk Bill—straight to the point. They collected a petition with, I think, over 600,000 signatures, such was the of strength of opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's important to understand what the incentives for increasing bulk-billing in pathology were. They go back to 2009, actually, when they were introduced by Labor. They were additional payments which were made by providers, who, in response to the payments, then chose to bulk-bill their patients in an out-of-hospital setting so that their patients don't face out-of-pocket costs. It was sensible policy and it actually worked, because, in just six years, diagnostic imaging bulk-billing rates rose 10 per cent thanks to these fairly sensible, well-targeted measures. By 2014-15, there were 114 million pathology services provided out of hospital, and 98 per cent of them were bulk-billed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bulk-billing pathology and removing barriers when you need a test are good things for getting tests done quickly. You are not muddling around, waiting for weeks to find $20 or $30 or $50. To many people in this House, that doesn't sound like a lot of money, but I can assure you that, to people in many parts of my community, $20 is an enormous amount of money when you're living hand to mouth. It is important that we don't provide disincentives to people to get tests because the evidence shows—I know the government is quite challenged by the word 'evidence'; think climate change or any manner of things—that it is important that poor and vulnerable people, indeed anyone, are not delayed in getting tests because those delays make them sicker. People are more likely to get sick and develop more serious conditions if they are not diagnosed quickly so that they can be treated properly. This is a false economy because, when people get sicker, they cost the health system more. You'd think that even the boneheads in the government would understand that it is not a good idea to remove incentives, but apparently not. They will remove incentives, which will make people sicker, will delay them getting tests and treatment and will run up the costs to the health system.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor ran hard on protecting Medicare at the election. The member for Oxley outlined the history of Medicare through the 1970s and 1980s, and through multiple elections, where we proposed a great public health system for the country so that anyone, regardless of their income or place in society, could access high-quality medical care. They could bulk-bill to see the doctor or pathologist and so on, if that's what they needed. We ran hard on that. We build it, and coalition governments try to cut it. Over the last few decades it's been in the Liberal Party's DNA to oppose universal services every step of the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government then panicked. They did a deal with Pathology Australia, and, just before the election, the pathology sector accepted this deal. The government said: 'We'll abolish these bulk-billing incentives, but we understand that you want bulk-billing, so we'll do something different. We'll re-regulate rents to general practitioners where you are co-located.' In some crazy, silly idea, the health minister—I won't even speculate on it because it's unparliamentary to speculate what might have been going through her brain or body—came up with such a ridiculous proposition without consulting and without understanding that if you squeeze one side of the balloon then the other side is going to bulge out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government did a deal to remove the bulk-billing incentives and re-regulate rents with GPs. That didn't go very well, did it? We told the Australian people: 'You should not trust the government on this. You can't trust them on Medicare; you certainly can't trust them on this deal.' The government said that we were lying; we were exaggerating; all of that was not true and of course people could trust the government because the government stick to their word on health and Medicare all the time. What happened? The government won the election. That's right—they fell over the line with 76 seats. Eventually, the Prime Minister got out from under the doona at Point Piper on election night. His wife must have pushed him into the car and said: 'Come on, come on! I know you don't like it but I think you're going to get there; you're going to get 76 seats. You have to man up and face the people.' They won the election. But, as it turned out, they lied. They shamelessly, cynically broke their deal and created a ridiculous mess. They ratted on the deal. What they discovered, of course, was that it was a stupid arrangement. The GPs were now furious because the GPs said: 'We're locked into leases. We have commercial business models in our practice. Government, you can't just come in randomly and re-regulate the rents on which a whole other set of other commercial arrangements rely. That's not very clever. That's not going to have the outcome you want.' So the government ratted on the deal.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This shows that health is always the Liberals' last priority. They talk a big game, but, when push comes to shove, when you have a look at where they put the money and at their record, it is clear that at the end of the day Medicare is just a logo to them. It's a green-and-gold logo. The thing that made the Prime Minister most furious—remember that tantrum that went on for weeks after the election—was that someone had used the Medicare logo. This was the health system, apparently. We had all that debate and an inquiry through the electoral matters committee to try to make it a Commonwealth offence to use the Medicare logo. That is completely missing the point: Medicare is not a logo; it's a public healthcare system that enables people, wherever they are in society, to access quality and affordable health care.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe we should be so proud of Medicare, and Australians generally are. We should be so proud, not just that we can see the GP but that, over time, as technology has changed and improved, we've continued with the ethos of a public health system that Labor introduced. They call it 'socialised medicine' in America—shock, horror. They spend a greater percentage of GDP per head of population on health care in America than we do, yet tens of millions of them can't see a doctor. They cannot get treated. That's what privatised medicine looks like. You only have to look to the United States. It's a country that I admire a lot, but we are a better society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be proud of the public healthcare system delivered by Labor and our legacy in creating this incredible asset that Australians love and value. We should be proud of it. It's not perfect. It never will be. Of course it won't be. But this is idiotic meddling, thinking, 'We'll cut the incentives.' They've just been proven, with evidence, to be driving up bulk-billing rates and enabling people to get tests in a timely matter and not pushing up future costs and make people sicker. That's when we should be going, 'That's a good idea.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the then head of the AMA, Dr Michael Gannon, said, getting rid of the bulk-billing incentives was a 'co-payment by stealth' and would hit the poorest and the sickest hardest. He went on to say that evidence showed that many patients—again, particularly the sickest and the most vulnerable—defer their treatment, exacerbating the pain and suffering for people in the community and pushing up the cost to the healthcare system. You'd think, as speaker after speaker has said, that the government would listen to the experts, the profession, and also consult with them. If you're going to come up with a stupid pre-election deal that stuffs up one part of the system while thinking you're fixing another, it's not good reform. It's not good policy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is important to me. I failed my family destiny to become a doctor or go into the health profession. My father was a specialist, my mother was a nurse and my uncle has two PhDs in nursing. I didn't want to go into medicine, but, surrounded by my family, I was brought up with that ethos that it wasn't just health care and service. My mum did always say: 'Darling, if you go into medicine, be a dermatologist. Don't be an obstetrician like your dad. The phone rings all night. Please don't do that.' But she also told me the family story about his GP practice. He died when I was four, so we hadn't won the Medicare battle with you guys opposite at that time. Apparently he was a great doctor but an awful business person. He never made any money from his GP practice because he felt sorry for his patients because they couldn't afford to pay the bills, so he wouldn't send them the bill. I think mum always maintained that he had to have a few days a week being an obstetrician so he could actually charge people.</span>

You can only imagine—the mind boggles, doesn't it?—how the current health minister is going to go in and clean up the mess. He's going to say, 'Don't you know who I am? You can all f-off!' and somehow that will fix it.</span>

I'm glad many of my colleagues have chosen to devote some time to it. We already heard the Prime Minister in question time. We pointed out quite honestly, 'You have cut the indexation rate for hospitals from what you promised.' The government went to an election and said, 'We're going to index hospital funding at 50 per cent.' I think it was 50 per cent. Don't quote me on that; I haven't got the figure in front of me. Then they provided a lower indexation rate. They cut the indexation rate. We pointed this out and said, 'You cut the funding,' and they said, 'No, we didn't; we increased the funding.' </span>

They say one thing, they get into office and they do another.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:44</span>):  I rise to speak on Health Insurance (Approved Pathology Specimen Collection Centres) Tax Amendment Bill 2018. This bill amends the Health Insurance (Approved Pathology Specimen Collection Centres) Tax Act 2000 to change the frequency of the tax paid by approved pathology collection centres—ACCs. This is an attempt by this government to clean up yet another Liberal mess. Currently, each of the approximately 6,000 ACCs pay a tax of $1,000 when first approved and when its approval is renewed each year. Under this bill, collection centres will instead pay a tax of $2,000 every two years, a move intended to reduce the regulatory burden for both government and industry whilst maintaining the revenue raised by the tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rate of the tax has not been increased since it was first introduced in 1999—nearly 19 years without an increase—which is surprising compared to the profits of the big providers who now dominate this sector. This is a minor change, and Labor will support the passage of the bill. However, as my friend the member for Bruce has just done, we need to examine why this government has put this bill forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2009, Labor introduced bulk-billing incentives for pathology and diagnostic imaging services. These incentives are an additional payment made to providers who choose to bulk-bill their patients in an out-of-hospital setting so patients do not face out-of-pocket expenses. The policy imperative underpinning this was that you shouldn't put barriers between a patient seeking medical treatment and diagnosis of their condition. It is, or should be, reasonably obvious that significant out-of-pocket expenses operate as a barrier to many people accessing appropriate, timely medical care. This policy meant that of the 114 million pathology services provided out of hospital by 2014-15, over 98 per cent were at no cost to the patient. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before the Liberals were up to their same old tricks. In the 2015-16 MYEFO, the government sought to cut $650 million from the Medicare bulk-billing incentives for pathology and diagnostic imaging, including by abolishing these incentives for pathology. There was no commitment to reinvest the money into health, only a vague statement by the government that the money would be funding other policy priorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the question of policy priorities, health is clearly not a priority for this government. It hasn't been a priority in the past. In fact, if there was a policy priority, it was towards subverting the issue of public health, including Medicare, until the Liberals belatedly realised that Medicare was really popular with the general population. Inevitably, these costs from abolition of incentives would result in increased charges, which would in turn be passed on to patients, increasing out-of-pocket costs and potentially delaying people's access to critical tests and diagnostic imaging. We on this side of the House fought back, as we always will, against the Liberal cuts to health, and the sector fought back with the memorable Don't Kill Bulk Bill campaign. The campaign was, of course, successful. It was so successful that the Prime Minister took fright and struck a hasty pre-election deal with the sector whereby pathologists accepted the abolition of the bulk-billing incentives in exchange for a government pledge to regulate the rents that pathologists pay GPs to co-locate in their practices. This did nothing to improve the feeling of GPs towards the government after they had already attempted to impose a $7 co-payment and froze the Medicare rebates. This deal with the pathology sector only served to perpetuate uncertainty for GPs about an important element of their business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As indicated previously, access to diagnostic imaging, including pathology and imaging, is absolutely central to the provision of cheap, effective and timely medical care. Once again, and unsurprisingly, the government has again backflipped on health, not just once, using its 2017 budget to break its deal with the pathologists and ditch the rent regulation plan but twice—secondly on the bulk-billing incentives that they first sought to cut back in 2015-16. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings us back to the bill that we have before us today. This bill can be fairly described as damage control—an attempt at an apology to a sector that has suffered under the hands of this government. This bill, again, makes it clear that health is not a priority for this government. We know they would rather give big business an $80 billion tax cut than properly fund health care. All we've seen from them is backflipping and cuts in successive areas of health policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians need relief from the costs of health care, not increases to their out-of-pocket expenses, especially at a time when they are paying more than ever for private health insurance—another important item in an average family's budget. This is important, whether or not you consider the cost of diagnostic investigation or substantive medical treatments and hospitalisation. In my electorate, the northern Tasmanian health system is already struggling with patient care and access to services. Northern Tasmanian patients are struggling with the fact that it's very rare to find a bulk-billing GP, irrespective of whether pathology tests or imaging are required. On Thursday last week, I raised the importance of properly funding our public health system, particularly for the Launceston General Hospital, the LGH. An estimated 7,092 families in Bass have private health insurance, and every year those people are hit with above-inflation premium price rises that put further strain on their household budgets, even before they are required to pay other out-of-pocket expenses. I know that low-income families who are relying on the public health system find it incredibly difficult to meet out-of-pocket expenses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is the only party that believe in universal health care and we are absolutely determined to fix our hospitals and facilitate better access to GPs, which includes, of course, access to pathology and diagnostic imaging. The Liberals have cut from Medicare and hospitals every year since the member for Warringah's horror 2014 budget. One of the most significant cuts was the cut to Labor's bulk-billing incentives in a bid to save a total of around $650 million. As I've said previously, their priority is everywhere but health. This is seen every day that they fight to give the big banks and big business billions in tax cuts rather than properly fund health. It's also seen in their language about creating a strong economy in order to pay for Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme or our public health system. This assumes—in their distorted world—that health and education are not a priority; they are optional—that is, if the economy can afford it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many decisions this government have made since they took office in 2013, the announcement of the axing of the bulk-billing incentive was a shock, especially as their own review of Medicare services was still taking place at that time. Such is the lack of empathy for health and the importance of health care to every Australian that they're prepared to make major changes without the review. Ultimately, it is the patients who are suffering under this government. The Prime Minister has continued the assault, cutting $2.8 billion from hospitals between the next election and 2025. He is giving an $80 billion handout to big businesses and the banks instead of funding health. He's leaving Australians languishing on waiting lists for critical surgeries, such as hip operations, knee replacements and cataract removal, at the same time as he's giving banks, especially the big banks, a $17 billion tax giveaway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The health of Australians should never take a back seat to a handout for big business. That's why Labor will fight to give Australian patients a fair go, with more funding and better hospitals. Labor will invest an extra $764 million over the forward estimates and $2.814 billion over six years to fix Australia's public hospitals, with funding to be allocated from a better hospitals fund. Labor's plan has been fully costed by the independent Parliamentary Budget Office. The then Minister for Health, the member for Farrer, argued that bulk-billing incentives for pathology were not necessary. She said that this was because the sector was naturally competitive. Again, the government is prepared to force out-of-pocket costs even higher and on to patients, many of whom are having to make a choice and, if they make that choice, they may go without.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The AMA warned that the government's co-payment by stealth would hit the poorest and the sickest the hardest. Did the government care? No, their priorities then and now are with big business and the big banks. In my electorate of Bass, I know that when people are struggling to keep up with the growing cost of living they will prioritise where every dollar goes. Now I fear that, thanks to this government, patients are deferring treatment because of the cost, exacerbating their pain and suffering and ultimately adding to the nation's health bill with much greater acuity on presentation to public hospitals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also of concern to me is the change that bulk-billing rates on pathology could have on rural and regional areas like Tasmania. Peak group Pathology Australia has warned that not only would bulk-billing rates fall, but some pathology collection centres may be forced to close. As I said earlier, this is particularly important in northern Tasmania, as we undeniably have a public health system which is under even greater stress. My electorate of Bass shares the northern coastline with the electorate of Braddon, where my friend and colleague Justine Keay is working hard to be re-elected, because she knows that Braddon will be better off under Labor. Tasmanians remember the Liberal promise that there would be no cuts to hospitals in 2013. What they do not know is that the Liberals tore up the intergovernmental agreement which bound the Commonwealth to bear 50 per cent of the increased cost in health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we had since? It's clear that this Prime Minister has just not learnt. The pathology sector's Don't Kill Bulk Bill campaign delivered a petition in 2016 with 600,000 signatures, showing once again that Australian people are deadset against cuts to health. They are simply not going to tolerate it. This campaign reached its target and the PM made a hasty retreat. The PM's dodgy deal asks pathologists to accept the abolition of bulk-billing incentives in exchange for a government pledge to regulate the rents pathologies pay to GPs to co-locate their practices. GPs were furious, they were already upset that the government's attempt to impose a $7 co-payment had been imposed upon them and that they had also frozen their Medicare rebates.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is one of a number of policy changes that the government has offered to the pathology sector, seen by some as part of a two-year apology to the sector for their past sins. This bill is not a health policy. It is conflict resolution writ large. This government has no vision for the future of health care. Its only purpose is cutting services for health and giving those resources away in billions of dollars of tax cuts for big business. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  The Health Insurance (Approved Pathology Specimen Collection Centres) Tax Amendment Bill 2018 is another example of the government's shambolic approach to the management of the health portfolio. It is an approach that we can see in so many other areas in the health portfolio, the government flip-flopping from one side to the other and ultimately landing on a position to try to get itself out of the mess. That is exactly what it's doing with respect to pathology fees. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It reminds me very much of the government's approach to the out-of-pocket costs or the co-payments that it wanted to introduce when the coalition took office in 2013. Firstly, it was a $7 co-payment, then a $5 co-payment. Then, if I remember correctly, there was meant to be some $20 cost on GPs. Ultimately, the government landed on just continuing the Medicare rebate freeze from 2014 right through to now, which effectively has caused doctors to apply their own co-payment in order to continue to make their businesses viable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not surprisingly, we don't have any government speakers that are prepared to come into the chamber and speak about this legislation. I get that this legislation isn't exactly exciting legislation; it deals with, I guess, an administrative matter when it comes to pathology specimen collection centres and the licence fee they pay to the government each year. Nevertheless, it goes to the heart of our health system, because there are few medical procedures carried out in Australia today, or medical appointments made with GPs and the like, that don't ultimately involve a pathology service of one kind or another, or an MRI service. Without those services, it's obviously very difficult for the doctors to pinpoint what the problem is. So it does go to the heart of the funding and the costs that a patient has to bear every time they go to see a doctor or a specialist. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw, with respect to this particular issue, the government first coming out and saying, prior to the 2016-17 election, that they would abolish the bulk-billing incentive payments for pathology services and MRI services. That, of course, created a huge backlash from the pathology industry itself, and quite understandably so, because this is an industry that made it absolutely clear that it was because of those incentive payments that they were able to keep their fees down for the patients. So the government then, in turn, said, 'Okay, we will raise the same revenue by promising that the pathology collectors get lower rents in the premises from which they have their services.' Most of those services are provided from within medical centres—medical centres generally run by a group of GPs. Of course, those GPs rely on the rent space that they get from the pathology collection agency to run their own medical practices. I'm sure that they have factored in the income they would receive from those pathology collection companies that are there as part of their business running costs. So when they protested, and understandably so, the government realised it now had an even bigger fight on its hands because it was fighting with the whole medical profession more broadly. The government had to backtrack, and it did so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is now looking at a way of trying to save some dollars in order to ensure that it finds savings in the pathology section of its budget. The reality is that the savings the government will find out of this legislation are minimal. We don't have a problem with the savings themselves on this side of the House. It means that instead of the centres paying their fees once a year, they pay them every second year. I'm not sure why they didn't suggest it be every third year. If it is the case that it saves money to the government in terms of the administrative costs, I'm sure it will also provide some savings to the individual practices or pathology centres that have to make the payments for their ability to continue their business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I do ask this question: it's not clear as to whether the money would go back to a pathology service provider if, for some reason, after having paid for two years in advance, they decide halfway through to cease their business. Whatever the case is, I don't know, but perhaps that is something the government might want to think about. The idea of biannual tax payments is nothing particularly new, and it's nothing that has any particular consequences of concern to us. What does concern me about it is that it is just another example of this government's ad hoc approach to its healthcare responsibilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, we're seeing another example of this with the Australian Dental Industry Association. The government has proposed to introduce a new fee for new dental products that are defined as low-risk medical devices. These fees will apply, from my understanding, to products that come from dental suppliers who are generally small business people in this country. Most of them are not big organisations. The fee proposed is $530 for each new low-risk medical device entry on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. Now, $530 doesn't sound like a lot of money, but when you add it up at the end of the year, for many of the small businesses associated with the Australian dental industry, it will amount to anywhere between $4,240 and $13,250, according to the industry itself. When you are starting to talk of amounts between $4,000 and $13,000, it does start to make a difference to small businesses in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concerning thing about this proposition is that the government is proposing to introduce it, I think, by 1 July, with no public consultation, no business impact analysis and no cost recovery impact statement ever having been carried out with the industry in respect of those new charges. This is all from a government that constantly comes into the chamber and tells us how they are the friends of small business, how they are the ones who will support small business and how they are the ones who are backing small business in this country. I couldn't think of a worse example of small business being betrayed by a government—no consultation, no discussions but, 'We're going to hit you with some new fees'. Clearly it is another example of the chaotic way that this government manages the health portfolio.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Australian dental industry, if a new fee is introduced, dentists will have no choice but to pass on those costs to the patient. The patient will ultimately wear the costs, because we don't have a universal dental scheme in Australia. Even with private health insurance in this country, patients inevitably pay considerable out-of-pocket costs with their dental expenses. That brings me to the question of private health insurance more broadly. We know it is becoming more unaffordable for people as each month goes by. We have seen the membership rates for private health insurance falling. Indeed, in country areas, I understand that now only 45.5 per cent even have hospital cover. We have seen increases in the exclusions within those policies and the costs of those policies rise 27 per cent under this government, which adds something like $1,000 a year or thereabouts for most families who have private health insurance. Indeed, the whole concept of private health insurance is becoming so complicated that we now have a website called Health Insurance Comparisons to help people try and decipher which policy they should go for and what it will cover. That's how complicated it has got.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now also have a health system that, in many parts of the country, is in crisis. We have hospital elective surgery wait times blowing out. Indeed, I recently dealt with a constituent in my office who was looking for elective surgery in South Australia and the response provided to that person was that the person would have to wait years for the procedure required. It's not for me to argue whether or not that procedure was urgent—that's for the doctors—but, when you have to wait years for an elective procedure, there is something wrong with the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that last year there were 7.8 million presentations to emergency services department of hospitals throughout the country. That's a 16 per cent increase over the previous years. I can only assume that that's not just attributed to the population growth but because more people are presenting to emergency services departments because they cannot afford to go to their normal GP or perhaps their specialist, depending on the issue. Again, that's borne out by the figures as well, as a result of the Medicare freeze. Ten years ago, the average GP out-of-pocket cost was $21. Today the average out-of-pocket cost is $38. For specialists, 10 years ago, it was $44. Today the average out-of-pocket cost for specialists is $88. Those costs demonstrate the shift in how much more people are having to pay to go to their doctors or to their specialists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not surprisingly, as a result of those increases in costs, the statistics also bear out another story. In 2016-17, according to the ABS, 1.7 million scripts were not filled by patients because, probably, they couldn't afford it and didn't see it as a priority. And 1.7 million Australians skipped a specialist visit—again, I can only assume—because they couldn't afford it. One million Australians either avoided or delayed a visit to their GP—again, I can only assume—because they couldn't afford it. Not surprisingly, also in 2016-17, 1,830 personal bankruptcies in Australia were attributed to health costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the statistics paint a very clear picture of the state of the health system in Australia. But no-one paints it more clearly than the new AMA president, elected only a month ago, Dr Tony Bartone, who at the AMA national conference in Canberra, only a month ago, said: </span>

It's being eroded little by little but, ultimately, the collective efforts or the collective changes that are being made are making a substantial difference, for the worse, to the universal health system that we have in this country—which I believe was a much better system years ago. As the member for Bass quite rightly pointed out, when universal health is undermined, the worst affected are people on low incomes. Sadly, many of the people on low incomes are also in rural, regional and remote Australia, where access to medical services is even more difficult. Again, the statistics show that their health outcomes are much worse than the health outcomes experienced in the rest of the country. Their access to services is much more difficult and, therefore, the prevalence of different illnesses is much higher in regional, rural and remote Australia.</span>

This bill amends the Health Insurance (Approved Pathology Specimen Collection Centres) Tax Act 2000 to increase flexibility by enabling the tax payable on the grant of an approval of an Approved (specimen) Collection Centre, ACC, to be calculated for approvals granted for periods longer than one year.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will amend tax payable on the grant of an approval of an ACC from $1,000 paid annually to $2,000 paid two yearly. The rate of the tax has not been changed since the act was enacted in 1999. Careful consideration was given for no increase to the tax so as to ensure that smaller ACCs were not negatively impacted.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes to the tax and the proposed corresponding amendment to the Health Insurance (Eligible Collection Centres) Approval Principles 2010 to extend approvals from one year to two years will be welcomed by the sector as they assist in reducing operational and administrative burden. There are a number of parallel projects that support the development and implementation of the government's direction for pathology that include administrative changes by automating and streamlining processes to reduce regulatory burden for pathology providers. The department has been engaging with, and will continue to engage with, key stakeholders prior to 1 July 2018 to advise of the amendment to the tax and the extension of the time frame for new and renewed ACC applications, including reaffirming the key elements of the measures announced in the 2017-18 budget.</span>

This amendment is an essential component to the budget measure as part of streamlining processes and reducing the administrative burden for pathology collection centres.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wakefield</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  I rise to speak on the Australian Astronomical Observatory (Transition) Bill 2018. Labor reluctantly supports this bill, as without our support the bill's failure would result in the closure of the Anglo-Australian Telescope and the Australian Astronomical Observatory laboratories in 2020. The Australian Astronomical Observatory represents a significant national capacity and something that the government should fundamentally support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Astronomical Observatory was established in 2010 as a division of the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research. This change was triggered during the global financial crisis by the withdrawal of the UK from the joint funding arrangement with Australia for the operation of the AAT. At that time, funding was secured from the Australian government for the operation of the Australian Astronomical Observatory for 10 years. This is due to expire in July 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is introduced to the House with the purpose of abolishing the Australian Astronomical Observatory and its advisory committee and handing over the operation of the 3.9-metre Anglo-Australian Telescope, commissioned in Siding Spring near Coonabarabran in New South Wales, and the astronomical instrumentation capability in North Ryde in Sydney to consortiums led by the Australian National University and Macquarie University respectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will also give effect to the 2017-2018 budget measure, access to world-leading astronomy infrastructure. This budget measure led Australia to sign a strategic partnership with the European Southern Observatory. This partnership gives the Australian optical astronomers access to one of the most advanced telescopes in the world, the eight-metre—which is the diameter of the surface of the collecting mirror of the telescope, suitably named the Very Large Telescope, or VLT—at the observatory on Cerro Paranal in Chile.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 10-year strategic partnership signed between the Australian government and the European Southern Observatory is at a cost of $119 million. The scientific community has been exploring a partnership with the Australian government and the European Southern Observatory for a number of years. <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia in the era of global astronomy: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he decadal plan for Australian astronomy 2016–2025</span>, produced by the Australian Academy of Science, calls for access to eight-metre-class optical astronomy infrastructure, which is not available in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The same plan calls for the maintenance of effort in terms of support for an Australian domestic capability, including supporting the Australian Astronomical Observatory and its capabilities. But this legislation proposes to off-load the main government astronomical assets—the Anglo-Australian Telescope near Coonabarabran in New South Wales and the AAO instrumentation capability—onto the Australian university sector. This is ostensibly being done to save the budget $26.1 million over the forward estimates. That's the final funding allocation. But, in reality, this is a sleight of hand, moving the main burden of maintaining these facilities from the Department of Innovation, Industry and Science onto entities that are funded by the Department of Education and Training. And there is some irony, that at a time when the government is seeking to cut university funding by $2.2 billion over four years it expects universities to stump up the resources to keep these key astronomy facilities operational.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This transition is not without cost. It is expected that a number of jobs will be lost in this transition. Four to five jobs will go at the Anglo-Australian Telescope, and up to nine jobs at the North Ryde instrumentation laboratories will be lost. One can imagine that those jobs are the jobs of highly skilled individuals who have committed themselves to what is a great national capability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also does not resolve the funding cliff that has plagued many areas of scientific endeavour in this country. It merely pushes it out by another 10 years. It kicks the can down the road. When the European Southern Observatory strategic partnership expires, the Commonwealth will need to decide whether to become a full member of the European Southern Observatory, seek access for Australian science to another telescope or discontinue this area of scientific leadership in astronomy that our country has long enjoyed. When constructed, the Anglo-Australian Telescope was one of the most advanced telescopes in the world. Its construction and operation have gifted the nation's scientists access to an advanced facility, but it has also developed advanced scientific and industrial capabilities. While it is now 40 years old, the Anglo-Australian Telescope is still an important part of the nation's research infrastructure. Labor is relieved that the assets of the Australian Astronomical Observatory will be maintained for the next seven years. However, their future beyond that date has still not been resolved, and there will be question marks over this government's commitment to this important national capability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will always support the goal of retaining Australia's capability in optical astronomy. Giving Australian astronomers access to the European Southern Observatory supports this vision. However, ensuring our scientists have access to the best research infrastructure should not come at the cost of outsourcing our existing infrastructure to the university sector. It's interesting that, while we're debating this bill, we have many states bidding for the leadership of this nation's capacity in the space area, and yet we have this bill on astronomy reflecting an entirely different approach. When we debate this bill, we should not forget that Australian astronomy is world leading. We have some of the best skies in the world for astronomical observations, and our continent faces 25 per cent of space. Our expertise and positioning has resulted in key roles in global consortia, such as the Square Kilometre Array and the Giant Magellan Telescope projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Industry, Innovation and Science's website mentions that the Anglo-Australian Telescope has had a constant upgrade to its instrumentation, which has helped maintain the high level of standard it has operated at since its commissioning in 1974. The Anglo-Australian Telescope was constructed using traditional equatorial mounting in which one of its rotation axes is parallel to the earth's axis. The Anglo-Australian Telescope is recognised for its excellent optics, its mechanical stability and its precision computer control, and all of these things make it a world-class telescope.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Anglo-Australian Telescope has so many significant achieve achievements, and it's worth the House thinking about these achievements. It has detected clouds near the surface of Venus through dense atmosphere. It has observed the spectacular explosion of the Supernova 1987A, the brightest supernova since the invention of the telescope four centuries earlier, giving astronomers unprecedented insight into the death of a star. It has discovered dwarf galaxies. It has made the first detection of an isolated brown dwarf star in our galaxy. For the House's information, I have no idea what an isolated brown dwarf star is, but I'm certain that our scientists needed to know about it. It has measured the ratios of visible and invisible mass in the universe. It has discovered streams of stars in our galaxy that are the remnants of dwarf galaxies that have been absorbed into our own.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are inspired of course by the work of Professor Brian Schmidt, now Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University and a joint winner of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. Professor Schmidt's team's breakthrough-of-the-year discovery, that the universe's expansion is accelerating, has altered our understanding of the universe, reversed previously held beliefs that the universe's expansion is slowing and led to new fields of study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this bill only adds to the government's disinclination to support Australian science, the Department of Innovation, Industry and Science, and research. As we recall, in their very first budget they hacked into the funding, seeking to cut almost $900 million from science and research.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will always stand up and fight for science and for its funding, and Labor is committed to lifting investment in research and development to three per cent of GDP by 2030. That is a national goal that Bill Shorten has stated at a number of Science meets Parliament dinners, and it reflects our commitment to science as a national endeavour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that science is the bedrock of constant growth and excellence in our health care, agriculture, education, environment, energy and the creation of future jobs. The Anglo-Australian Telescope and the Australian Astronomical Observatory laboratories are still state of the art. They still represent an important national capacity that needs to be maintained. That is why the opposition reluctantly supports this bill. Without its passage, we won't see these facilities transferred to the university sector, and the result will be their closure in 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It does tell you everything about how this government proceeds and how it undertakes these great national endeavours. And they are great national endeavours. This was, in fact, a commitment that was first brought about by the Fraser government. Whatever you thought about Prime Minister Fraser, he did believe that the nation should have the ability and capacity to lead in these very important areas. This government adopts a very different view about science. It adopts a very different view of national progress. That is a great pity. There's always talk about bipartisanship in this building, but these national endeavours used to genuinely, I think, find not just support but active interest on both sides of this House. For ministers, backbenchers and governments of all shapes and sizes, it wasn't a question of honouring the other side's achievements as much as it was of building on them. By all accounts, these capacities were debated for a decade before the Fraser government made the decision. They were opened in 1974 by the Whitlam government. So what you had was a situation where governments—and, dare I say it, generations of politicians on different sides—created, nurtured and built a national capacity. What we find from this government is a completely different approach. They find a national capacity, and they seek actually to offload it—though to very worthy institutions; the universities involved are very worthy. We would want them involved, in any event.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the question that faces the country in these sorts of bills is: are these the sorts of things that our national government should be leading, should be interested in, should be building on and should be endeavouring to make a truly and genuinely national capacity? You only get that if you have not just an opposition that's committed to science but a government that's committed to science—not just one generation of politicians that is committed to this capacity.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Cyber Security Centre 2017 threat report</span> noted that CERT Australia responded to 734 incidents affecting private-sector systems of national critical infrastructure within the 2016-17 financial year. This equates to a significant cyberincident occurring on these networks more than twice a day. In October 2017, the US-CERT released a report that stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Since at least May 2017, threat actors have targeted government entities and the energy, water, aviation, nuclear, and critical manufacturing sectors, and, in some cases, have leveraged their capabilities to compromise victims' networks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation 2017 annual report, Australia continues to be a target of espionage through cybermeans. The cyberthreat is persistent, it's sophisticated and it is not limited by geography. The report also notes that the clandestine acquisition of intellectual property, science and technology and commercially sensitive information is increasing. This highlights the need for a greater focus on the security of the cybersystems underpinning our critical infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are to effectively safeguard our critical infrastructure, we need to think about more than the issue of who owns what and the issue of physical assets such as ports, poles and wires. We need to think beyond just the protection of critical infrastructure from a physical perspective and start thinking about the protection of critical infrastructure from a cybersecurity perspective. As more and more essential services are managed electronically, interdependence between the physical systems and cybernetworks needs to be clearly understood to ensure that services continue to be provided and our national interest continues to be protected. We also need to broaden our thinking on what is classified as critical infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Trusted Information Sharing Network, Australia's primary national engagement mechanism for business-government information sharing and resilience-building initiatives on critical infrastructure resilience, describes critical infrastructure as the physical facilities, supply chains, information technologies and communication networks which, if destroyed, degraded or rendered unavailable for an extended period, would significantly impact on the social or economic wellbeing of the nation or affect Australia's ability to conduct national defence and ensure national security. It states that each of these critical infrastructure sectors are vital to Australia's social cohesion, economic prosperity and public safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why did the government's recent Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 only address four sectors as being at the highest risk? We actually have eight critical infrastructure sectors in this country. These are the sectors that have been deemed as vital to Australia's social cohesion, economic prosperity and public safety. We have eight, so why did the act only include four sectors that are deemed as highest risk? I'll read out our eight. They are banking and finance, communication, energy, food and grocery, health, transport, water services and Commonwealth government. Each of these identified critical infrastructure sectors have experienced some form of cyberthreat in the past 12 month. It is great that we have eight—though, unfortunately, all eight weren't included in the governments critical infrastructure act—but, compared to other nations, we are very, very underdone. Eight is a conservative number. The United States critical infrastructure security and resilience strategy identifies 16 sectors, the United Kingdom identifies 13 sectors, Canada identifies 10 sectors and Singapore identifies 11 sectors. The sectors that are recognised by these nations include emergency services, information technology, infrastructure, chemicals, manufacturing and electoral systems. At the very least, electoral systems in Australia should be treated as critical infrastructure, particularly given what we've seen in the US and France.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have got to start taking this seriously. We have got to start taking our critical infrastructure seriously. It's not enough only to protect the physical safety of our critical infrastructure; to partially list those services and facilities that are vital to our cohesion, economic prosperity or public safety; to ignore international cybersecurity standards; or to pretend that threats end where the supply chain starts. There is so much more to do in this space. I just wish the government were listening.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BANKS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  Our responsibility to serve the people of Australia must always be guided by two principles and values that have underpinned my work as the member for Chisholm, being love and respect. The establishment of the National Redress Scheme, which was recommended by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, is one way Australian governments are working to acknowledge and help people who experienced child sexual abuse. I'm proud of the Turnbull government, and I commend my colleague the Minister for Social Services, who has painstakingly worked with these survivors, with state and territory governments and, importantly, with the responsible institutions to ensure that the National Redress Scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse will be survivor focused.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Redress will be made to children who deserved to be safe but whose lives were shockingly impacted by sexual abuse. As difficult as it is, as a government and as parliamentarians we have to confront the truth that has been revealed through the commission process. As such, the integral National Redress Scheme is part of the crucial healing process. The governments and institutions that have signed up accept the system failed every single person in Australia who suffered sexual abuse in an institution that was actually meant to protect them. We know that redress cannot truly compensate for what has occurred. However, it will acknowledge the hurt and harm suffered by the individuals and ensure institutions take responsibility for the abuse that occurred on their watch by their people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to put on record my very deep respect for the survivors and their families who have suffered the most horrid abuse in these institutions. It is their struggle, their dedication and their bravery which has led us to where we were today. I have the utmost respect for victim advocates like the late Anthony Foster, who I never had the honour to meet, who, with his wife, Christine, represented the immense power of a parent's love. As parents, we unashamedly rise to protect our children with unconditional love. The Fosters showed the wholly encompassing and unconditional love we have for our children, and their determined struggle and their fight for their daughters has been truly inspiring. Sadly, the abuse their daughters endured affected members of our community in Chisholm and beyond. Heartbreakingly for the Foster girls and for Anthony, redress has come too late. I hope, however, that for many other victims the Fosters gave a voice to, in Chisholm and beyond, the National Redress Scheme will assist in healing and will provide some justice for the incredible wrongs they have endured.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is because of the determined advocacy of people that have been so terribly impacted by this issue that our government has been able to implement the National Redress Scheme for institutional child sexual abuse. By sharing their personal stories, these courageous survivors and their families have provided hope that future generations of Australians will be protected from the scourge of child sexual abuse. Revelations to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse shocked Australians everywhere and highlighted the suffering endured by too many young, innocent, beautiful Australian children at the hands of people who were entrusted with their care. I say to survivors: we've heard your story and we will continue to listen. The Turnbull government is undertaking a national consultation process to ensure that the voice and wishes of survivors shape the national apology to be delivered by the Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, in October this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all of us, the safety of Australian children is paramount. What is in the best interests of the Australian child should always remain paramount and stand above all else. We owe it to them to ensure they are protected always.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  Two weeks ago, when many people around the world marked the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Robert Kennedy, one of the quotes that people most frequently recalled then was what Bobby Kennedy said about GDP, about economic growth. He said that GDP 'measures everything, except that which is worthwhile'. In the same week I got a real sense of that when we did have some quite welcome economic data. When the government was speaking about that data there was something lost in the self-congratulation about it. There was, I think, a lack of recognition that, at the end of the day, the economy is not some cold and abstract thing but something that people feel and experience in the suburbs and towns of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that that sense was missing in the absence of recognition that, for a lot of people, whether it's in wages or inability to spend or not being able to save or racking up household debt, the economy is a difficult place, and it's not worthy of a lot of the self-congratulations that we get in this building—particularly a couple of weeks ago. The other thing that was missing was an affinity with people who do it tough in this country. It was a reminder that, the purpose of economic policy, the purpose of this place in lots of ways, should never be just about boosting the profits of our companies. That's important, but it should be about boosting the opportunities of our people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to think more broadly about what success means in the modern market economy in Australia, what it actually means to have a prosperous country and a prosperous economy and how we can leverage that to give more kids from communities like mine the opportunity to get ahead in their own lives. I think it would be a tragedy if, in the 27th year of our own economic expansion, kids born in communities like mine feel that they are consigned to a certain kind of future—the same kind of future that their parents may have had to endure in their own lives. It would be a tragedy in the 27th year that our economy has grown to see inequality and immobility handed down within families and within suburbs. It is not too late to change course, but it requires the collective will of governments—I would say it requires a Labor government—and community to make sure that we don't continue down this path that sees the gap between rich and poor widen or to see this cancer of social immobility impact on more and more of our young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say all this because two Thursdays ago we lost someone who understood this as well as anyone I've ever met. Two Thursdays ago, I was sitting there during question time, and you were obviously sitting there too, Mr Speaker, when I got a note saying that one of my favourite people, Joy Tillgren-Wright—but we all knew her as Tilly—had passed away. Tilly understood the collective power of government—the power of the Labor Party, in particular—and the power of community. She had volunteered for so many years—for decades—for Meals on Wheels and the Lions Club and she was a daily volunteer in my office. The reason we knew something was wrong was that Tilly wasn't there at the usual time in the lunch room of our office. So two Saturdays ago, instead of celebrating what would have been her 70th birthday, we had her funeral at St Pauls. Tilly was cheeky, mischievous and terrific company. She was a tiny little person with a massive heart. She had a really stirring sense of fight in her and a fairness. She was a terrific friend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I raise all this alongside some of the other comments I made about politics, the economy and the country, because she was such a big believer in the Woodridge that she lived in for so long. She grew up elsewhere. She had a very difficult life and she wanted to give so much back to our community. So I wanted to say to her family and to her friends—our friends, our community—and the people who worked alongside her in my office that the work that we do here in the weeks and months ahead will be a tribute to Tilly. We miss her already.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="MT4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMillan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  I hope all the people who needed to hear that speech did hear that speech. Twenty years ago I was turning the sod on an adventure at Walhalla. I was the member for McMillan at the time, of which Walhalla was a part. Michael Leaney was turning the sod on a dream that was a huge risk: he was going to rebuild the Star Hotel—long gone—at Walhalla. He had decided, as a young man, that he would rebuild a hotel that was at that time in the middle of nowhere, in Walhalla, where they had 20,000 visitors a year, if that. Michael Leaney was going to rebuild the Star Hotel. We turned the sod for the Star Hotel and he built the Star Hotel. I was there the other day. He said: 'Here' a photo of you, Russell. Here you are, sitting at the end of the group, as we turned the sod for the Star Hotel.' I looked a little different! Michael was somebody who actually followed his dream.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another dreamer in this House who made a great contribution was the former Nationals leader Tim Fischer. What's he got to do with Michael Leaney? Tim loved trains and, of course, Walhalla has trains. As the member for McMillan, I couldn't go a day in this House without Tim Fischer saying to me: 'How's Walhalla going?' And we were able to get some funding then to enable the enhancement of the railway. The Star Hotel was the local pub. There were dangerous mines everywhere and people lived a long way away. You had to go through Moe, turn north past Westbourne, and go up to Erica and then into Walhalla.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three crucial bits of infrastructure that we need. We need the South Face Road built so that access to Walhalla will be easy, we need more power for Mount Baw Baw and we need sewerage in Walhalla for it to be able to expand. And, if we can get it, we need more funding so the railway can go from the Thomson River all the way down to Erica. The state government have the plans before them. I hope they will put presentations before us. We have just been able to plan for the building of a mobile phone tower for Walhalla for safety and further recreational opportunities under the Black Spot Program. But there are some difficulties. It is solid rock where you have to dig to put this tower in. The department might have to look at three smaller towers through the valley rather than one big tower where it is going to be extremely difficult to cut through the rock to get the power and the cables in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned the now Councillor Michael Leaney because of needing to do the things we need to do for small communities. I visited Neerim South Aged Care the other day with Kate, the new leader. They are so enthusiastic. It is great to do big things in cities. We see the major infrastructure that gets announced. We are going to have rail to the airport, a new freeway here and a tunnel there. It will cost billions of dollars. But in small communities like Walhalla and Neerim South it doesn't take a lot of money to change the lives of a lot of people. Walhalla now has 140,000 visitors a year and the infrastructure can no longer cope with the people who want to come and visit. Michael Leaney's hotel is a pleasure to go to, a pleasure to stay at. The coffee is as good as you would get anywhere across the metropolitan parts of Melbourne and Sydney. You are in pristine fresh air in an eerie valley with a huge history. Remember, it was sustenance workers who built that railway line for the first time that went from Moe, through Erica, and up through Coopers Creek to Walhalla. They built an enormous trestle bridge over the Thomson River. I think their vision was marvellous. Michael Leaney, congratulations. It is a pleasure to still be here 20 years on.</span>

                  <a href="8GH" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  The first principle of child protection must always be the rights and interests of the child. If a child's wellbeing is compromised, they must be made safe and removed from that danger. This is deeply understood and supported by our leader, my colleagues in the Labor Party and, I'm sure, all members of this place. Labor's position to ensure the immediate safety and security of First Nations children is unequivocal. All of us in this place understand all too well the intergenerational impacts of removal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first act of the newly elected Rudd government in 2008 was to make an apology to the stolen generations. This year marks the 10th anniversary of that apology and 21 years since the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report. The report and the apology showed us that the removal of First Nations children from their families, their communities and their culture on such a mass scale had devastating consequences that transcended generations—consequences that we still see today. In part, it contributes to the gap in quality-of-life outcomes—the gaps in health, education, employment and training. There are the impacts of the removal policies. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The impacts of the removal policies continue to resound through the generations of Indigenous families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, the government announced its response to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The inquiry found that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are significantly overrepresented in out-of-home care and youth detention, exposing them to environments with greater risk. It is difficult to ignore how the issues of institutionalised child abuse and the removal of First Nations children is inextricably linked. The royal commission found that being strong in culture is protective for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children's wellbeing because it can support strong identity, high self-esteem and strong attachments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report was that, if an Indigenous child must be removed, they are placed with family or a member of their community—the Indigenous child placement principle, kinship care. It follows that, yes, if a child is in danger, they should be removed, but that doesn't mean that they should accept the endless widespread removal of First Nations children from their families. I do not accept the false dichotomy that somehow we must choose between a child's welfare and Indigenous culture, as if the two were somehow incompatible. It is dishonest, offensive and cynical to take on this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Minister for Community Services in New South Wales, I saw firsthand the complex nature of challenges in child protection. We are confronted with the strong possibility of another stolen generation and all of the intergenerational ramifications that has for future First Nations children and governments. The number of Indigenous children in out-of-home care has virtually doubled from 9,000 to 17,000. At this rate, by 2025 the number will surpass the total number removed as part of the stolen generations. It is a complex policy area and will require a nuanced, holistic and comprehensive policy approach led by First Nations people who work in this space, like the Family Matters campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reducing the number of removals means creating safe and healthy domestic environments for First Nations children. This means improving health and employment outcomes. It means improving housing. We need better cultural understanding and training for service providers, but we also need to involve in the policy-making process those who are most affected by this issue. We need to empower First Nations communities to build safe communities for Indigenous children. As the Prime Minister said, we need to speak with First Nations people and not to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor in government will host a summit in the first 100 days for First Nations community groups and leaders to discuss the issue of child protection and child removal if we are afforded government. Mr Speaker, I know, as you do, that this is a deeply complex issue, but it must be addressed. I say this to everyone in this House, and I know that everyone would agree with me: this is not just the business of First Nations people; this is the business of all of us.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  Last week I was in the Goldfields when the twin city Kalgoorlie-Boulder celebrated a historic milestone—the 125th anniversary of the discovery of gold. In June 1893, Paddy Hannan and Thomas Flanagan discovered the first alluvial gold on the slopes of Mount Charlotte. Later joined by Dan Shea, they searched and uncovered 100 ounces of gold within a short period of time. Paddy's reward claim was pegged, and he rode the 30 miles to Coolgardie to the warden's office. This started a gold rush that would eventually lead to the discovery of the richest gold find in Australia's history: the Golden Mile. Today, 125 years on, this find is still one of the world's biggest producers of gold and has produced over 60 million ounces of gold in just over a century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, the Eastern Goldfields Historical Society hosted a Revisit Hannan's Reward Claim public event during which local historian Scott Wilson recounted the historical details of these discoveries and KCGM general manager, Cecile Thaxter, acknowledged the legacy they have inherited. This event opened the First Wealth Of Nations Mining Heritage Conference, with international history and mining buffs featuring on the speakers and guests list. That evening the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder hosted a gala anniversary ball, which many attended in full period dress to commemorate this auspicious occasion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder is not only celebrating the past; it's looking to the future. The region currently produces more than $8 billion in mineral exports per annum. There are 108 operating mines and nearly 700 prospective mines across the economic zone. While gold has always been the hallmark of the goldfields, lithium is the new gold, and this region is leading the world in producing and processing this resource. WA produces more than half of the world's raw lithium. Two years ago the only mine was the Talison Lithium mine in Greenbushes in the south-west of my electorate of O'Connor. Last year, Galaxy Resources resumed exporting from Ravensthorpe, and the Ganfeng Neometals mineral resources consortium began shipping lithium from the Mount Marion mine. In more good news, Neometals CEO, Chris Reed, announced an optional agreement to sublease a 40 hectare site in Kalgoorlie for a proposed lithium hydroxide refinery. Meanwhile, Tawana Resources commenced lithium production at Bald Hill near Kambalda and shipped its first concentrate earlier this month</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was fantastic to have the opportunity to showcase some of these incredible Goldfields mining success stories to the federal minister for resources, Senator Matt Canavan, when he visited the city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder on Thursday of last week. We kicked off the day with a tour of the 115-year-old Western Australian School of Mines, which is ranked second in the world as a university of mining excellence. WASM Alumni president, Raleigh Finlayson, and former alumni president, Bill Beament, joined Professor Vishnu Pareek and Associate Professor Richard Browner in proudly showcasing some of their advanced technologies. We discussed some of the issues of looming labour force shortages as a consequence of reduced student enrolments. Four years ago, enrolments stood at more than 100 but this year fell to less than 20. The Western Australian School of Mines has large and prestigious alumni, many of whom are major players in the global resources industry. I will be working with the minister to see its numbers restored to meet the ever-increasing demand for graduates in surveying, engineering and metallurgy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next we drove out to Mount Marion with Mineral Resources' general manager of external affairs and someone well known to people in this place, former federal minister for resources and energy Gary Gray and were shown around their open-cut lithium mine. Minister Canavan and I had the thrill of detonating a blast and watching the crushing and extraction process through to the finished product.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in the heart of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, we visited the KCGM super pit, hosted by general manager Cecile Thaxter. The immense scale of this open-cut mine was not lost on the minister, and the historic significance of the scores of old shafts in the ore face were evidence of over a century of underground mining. Cecile revealed that if you laid all the shafts end to end they would reach right across Australia. At MLG Oz, the minister was hosted by Murray Leahy, retiring head of Ausdrill and industry legend, Ron Sayers, and other drillers and contractors to discuss workforce shortages across the Goldfields.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we dropped into the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia to meet Executive Officer Rowena Olsen, Chair John Malone and the eastern zone committee. The Kalgoorlie-Boulder CME was formed 117 years ago and now houses the new Kalgoorlie-Boulder Mining Innovation Hub, whose director, Sabine 'the Miner' Shugg, is also a Western Australian School of Mining alumna.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">WA is renowned for its mining industry, and the headline projects are the massive Pilbara iron ore natural gas deposits. But the WA mining industry was conceived in the Goldfields 125 years ago and the Golden Mile remains its heart and soul. It was my absolute pleasure to introduce the minister for the first time to the historic WA Goldfields on such a momentous occasion as the 125th anniversary.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HWP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MARINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  I want to congratulate the Riding for the Disabled Association of Western Australia South-West Centre. They are based in Gelorup, and recently they celebrated their 40th birthday. From very humble beginnings in 1978, they have now grown to servicing over 2,000 clients in the region. The work of founding members Maud Stanley, Olga Green and Jean Lishman has been vital in ensuring that countless people with disabilities have experienced the organisation's amazing services. All three women were instrumental in setting up the association and have volunteered thousands of hours over its 40 years, as you can imagine. Deservedly, they've all received life membership. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During Maud Stanley's long association with the organisation, she became a coach for both therapeutic riding and hippotherapy. Nowadays, Maud still coaches the hippotherapy group and is on the WA hippo committee. Olga was a coach until retiring just a few years ago. Jean also retired recently. She started in the therapeutic riding sessions before moving to hippotherapy, and she became involved in the WA hippo central committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the tireless work of the centre's other life members: Robert Warwick, Stanley Buck, Lorraine Monahan, Patricia Thompson, Dorothy Orloff, Geoff Brown, Terry Guiness and Ken Wood. I thank all the local sponsors and donors, who have made sure that Riding for the Disabled has been able to continue its work. I have seen firsthand as a patron in Harvey the freedom that someone with severe disability has on the back of a horse. It's amazing how the horses adjust to the movements and the needs of the individual on their backs. It's just extraordinary. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Medical professionals recognise there are significant therapeutic benefits for people across the board from connecting with horses. The three-dimensional movement of horses transferred through the rider's body relaxes people and strengthens core stability, reducing spasms and improving balance, posture and coordination. The joy on the faces of people who are on the backs of those horses has to be seen to be believed. For some of them, it is their first independent movement ever. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the state, Riding for the Disabled provide more than horseriding. Vaulting, carriage driving, dressage and, as you heard before, hippotherapy are also services they provide. For many people with a disability, the organisation gives them the opportunity to get out of the house and participate in an activity that they otherwise wouldn't have the chance to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the great work that Riding for the Disabled do in Gelorup and right across Australia, particularly that of the hardworking volunteers in the south-west, in my electorate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  I commend the previous speaker, the member for Forrest, for her remarks.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to be able to make this speech in the house today. I'd like to acknowledge and congratulate an outstanding member of the Macarthur community, the Indigenous community and the Australian community, Darryl Wright, who last week received an Order of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Darryl was born in Murrurundi. He is a Dhanggati man, a man of the fresh air and gum trees, who is Chief Executive Officer of Tharawal Aboriginal Corporation. Tharawal is an Aboriginal community controlled medical and healthcare service that is unlike any other healthcare service in this country. It has been marvelled at by people such as Sir Michael Marmot, the World Health Organization's chair of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health, who said that Tharawal was making the fantasy of a fairer distribution of power, money and resources a reality. It uses community empowerment—a community controlling the services needed for its population—to improve things for its own community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been involved with Tharawal for many years, and the continuing success of the corporation is a result of the guidance and the vision of Darryl's leadership. Darryl has spent his whole life working with Indigenous communities across New South Wales, and also serving as National Aboriginal Sports Academy chair, the Australian Indigenous Rugby League chair, the Corporation for Homeless (Aboriginal Corporation) chair, the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council director and many more official positions. Darryl's lifelong commitment to his community was inspired by his grandmother who was part of the Stolen Generations and was taken from her home to a girls home in Cootamundra. Despite obvious struggles, she always told him to never keep anything to himself and constantly share ideas and pass them along. Darryl's always strived to empower young people in the Aboriginal community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tharawal works collaboratively with John Warby Public School to provide extensive support to the Indigenous and non-Indigenous children to provide further education. Darryl is also actively involved in the rehabilitation of Indigenous adolescents incarcerated in the Reiby juvenile detention centre, and I've seen active evidence of what a difference Darryl and Tharawal have made to them. I really congratulate him for this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tharawal is actively involved in providing training and support for young people who are unemployed, and it is also actively involved in teaching our nurses and doctors about Indigenous health. My colleague Dr Andrew McDonald and his wife, Dr Jenny McDonald, have for many years provided paediatric support services to Tharawal. Darryl takes great pride in working with Indigenous people, empowering them, making them proud and helping them, and our entire community, to be proud of themselves. Darryl is to be commended for his award. As I've said, nothing gives me greater pleasure than to congratulate him.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  On 14 and 15 June, as part of my responsibilities under the Defence subcommittee of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade standing committee, I travelled to Rockhampton to inspect exercises Hamel and Sea Raider underway at the Shoalwater Bay training area. I was accompanied by the committee defence liaison officer, Wing Commander Jacqui Carswell and James Rees the committee secretary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were greeted at Rockhampton Airport and escorted to our waiting MRH-90 helicopter. We joined a number of ADF personnel transferring to the Army base at Shoalwater Bay, where we were briefed about Exercise Hamel. I was greeted by Major General Paul McLachlan, who had read all about my announcement last Wednesday of Praesidium Global of $2 million for the supply of four unmanned ground vehicles. The Army are keenly awaiting the supply of these tremendous vehicles, constructed in Caloundra in my electorate of Fisher, so that they can put them through their paces during operation Talisman Sabre next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a short drive from the Army headquarters in a magnificent Bushmaster, we were off again in an MRH-90 headed for HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span>, the Royal Australian Navy's flagship. Onboard, we were greeted by the captain, Ashley Papp. HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span> and her sister ship HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Adelaide</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>comprise the Navy's class of large air-capable amphibious assault warships, designated as landing helicopter docks—LHD. To date, they are the largest vessels ever operated by the Royal Australian Navy and a vital asset in the pursuit of the nation's current force protection strategy. <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span> is capable of many roles but is primarily assigned to the conduct of amphibious operations, along with tactical logistic support, command and control support, and military support operations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, I had to leave the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span> at 13:30, just a few hours before her embarked forces of 900 infantry were to leave by helicopter and landing craft. Two years of planning had to come to a crescendo on that day and the ship was abuzz with excitement. This would be the largest amphibious assault, albeit as an exercise, undertaken by the ADF using Australian-owned resources. On 15 June, Australia joined the ranks of only six countries around the world with capacity for amphibious assault. The men and women serving onboard HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Choules</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Newcastle</span> did our country proud, and it showed to our friends and allies and, indeed, the world, just how capable she is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to particularly acknowledge the following service men and women for making our trip to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span> so memorable: the flight crew on the MRH-90; Major General Paul McLachlan; Brigadier Ben James AM; Captain Ashley Papp; Colonel Matt Sieber of the US Marines; Commander Terrence Garside, Airside Operations; Commander Thompson, Navy Test Lead; and Lieutenant Katherine Garrett.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  The greater Penrith region is where it's at. My community is bursting at the seams with talent and skill, and I am very, very proud to represent them. The sixth annual ARTWEST St Marys art and craft exhibition took place on 1 June at the St Mary's Community Centre and showcased the absolute best the arts has to offer in my community. The event was attended by over 150 locals and showcased 90 artworks from right across our community. ARTWEST St Marys art and craft exhibition is a great avenue for all of our local artists and those from wider Western Sydney, fine arts students, school students, artisans and craftspeople, to annually showcase their work in different artistic mediums. The exhibition aims to provide local artists with an opportunity to exhibit and sell their work and become involved in the planning and implementation of the event. This arts based initiative provides community members with a platform to inspire others through art and enhance individual wellbeing, self-esteem and confidence, building our community and participation, and also, of course, skills development through project management and installation of art works. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a well-known fact that Western Sydney only receives one per cent of this government's arts funding, and generally we have a higher population than anywhere else in New South Wales in the greater Western Sydney region. To get only one per cent of the arts funding sees local artists suffer. The investment in the arts and culture in our region is incredibly low. We need to fight for local talent, local artists and local culture. I will fight for more investment for arts and culture in the greater Western Sydney region. Unlike many other industries, the arts will not be disrupted with the advent of the new technology age. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">ARTWEST is more than just an exhibition. It's a movement to encourage artists to be proud of the work they create, to feel a sense of accomplishment in seeing their work on display and to be proud of their community in doing so. I was in awe of the people who created artworks across a range of mixed media. The ability to express themselves in such a creative way is such a gift, and in comparison to my stick figure doodles I'm completely envious of the talents that were showcased there on the night. We hear a lot about the jobs and growth of the future, but the advent of smart technology will not adversely affect the flourishing growth of the creative arts. That will be one of the sectors least affected. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The exhibition showcases the growth and the need for investment that this requires, particularly in areas that fall out of the inner city suburbs. ARTWEST showcased a feature artist, Geoff Sellman, who was one of four Indigenous artists to win the 2018 NAIDOC art award and to have his artwork featured in clothing company Lifewear Australia's NAIDOC 2018 collection. Geoff is an emerging artist practising in Western Sydney with traditional training from his Bunda Bunda tribal community in Bundaberg, Queensland. His art piece, named <span style="font-style:italic;">Her Opal </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Spirit</span>, which was a tribute to his aunty Vi, paid homage to the theme, 'Because of her we can'. I would like to place on record my thanks to Karen Brown, Adnan Begic, Jan Needham, Peter Gonzales and Lisa Kolosovs, who have all been involved and tirelessly working towards this. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  Last week I had the chance to catch up with some of the recipients of our Local Sporting Champions grants. Over afternoon tea, I was able to hear from these amazing young sports talents about their experiences, challenges and aspirations. Hannah Rutherford, at just 13 years of age, is part of the Central Coast team for the National Water Polo Championships. Hannah trains at least twice a week in addition to swim training a few extra days every week. Josiah Goodwin, a year 10 student at Terrigal High School, is already competing in the national figure skating competition. For somebody who started only ice skating six years ago, Josiah is already an accomplished athlete. Six days a week he trains both on and off the ice, with the goal to one day represent Australia at the Olympics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Matilda Ralph is also at home on the ice as part of the Southern Sky Synchronized skating team. I have to say that this is the first time I have ever heard about this sport, which Matilda described to me as a combination of dancing and synchronised swimming all on ice. As part of an 18-person ensemble, Matilda said that precision is key and that she's required to train five days a week for three hours at a time. She's got her sights set on competing at the 2020 world championships. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aimilee Stokes is a 13-year-old BMX rider, who after only two years has already competed in the New South Wales state championships as well as in the ACT. Training around three times a week means that Aimilee spends most of her free time working to improve her riding ability and confidence. I have to admit that I don't think I could ever do what Aimilee does out on a BMX track. We're incredibly proud of her. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next month Katie Newman will be participating in the 2018 Netball New South Wales State Age Championships as part of the Woy Woy representative team. For Katie the dream is to one day play netball professionally, and she trains incredibly hard to make this a reality. Hannah Bolton last year won bronze in the Australian All Schools Championships in the race walk event as part of the New South Wales team. This is a highly technical sport that requires an enormous amount of skill and endurance. I really loved hearing all about it and Hannah's technique. She even gave us a quick lesson in race walking. Over afternoon tea, every one of these sporting champions was able to raise with me one issue that was most important to them, from access to sporting infrastructure to the cost of pursuing sport at an elite level. I look forward to raising their concerns with my colleagues over the next sitting week. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to pay tribute to a few sporting champions who couldn't join us on the day but who are also exceptional athletes. To Ashleigh Thacker, Daisy Duguid, Tara Mulcahy, Nathan Holt, Thomas Lynch, Jessica and Thomas Sawyer, Callum Sutton and Asher Ryan: congratulations on your incredible achievements in your chosen sport. Pursuing sport like this requires enormous commitment. To the parents of our sporting champions: I acknowledge your dedication, your support and your tireless efforts. To our sporting champions: we are proud of everything you've already achieved.</span>

                  <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  Well, in a Melbourne Cup field of dumb decisions, this government's decision to close the Warrawong office of Centrelink takes the cake. I'm pleased to be standing here today with the member for Cunningham, Sharon Bird, calling on the government to stop this dumb decision going ahead. Why is it a dumb decision? Because Warrawong and the surrounding suburbs have some of the highest rates of unemployment of any area within the Illawarra. The youth unemployment rate is well above the state average, with the general unemployment rate approaching 10 per cent in most of those suburbs around Warrawong, including Berkeley, Lake Heights and Warilla. That area is also home to a very, very high number of non-English speaking people, many of whom are now ageing. So you've got lots and lots of pensioners, many of whom have English as their second language, and as they are getting older they are struggling with retaining their English language. They require a service in their own suburb which enables them to go in and talk face to face with a human being to have their issues dealt with. The government can reverse this decision, and it should reverse this decision. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are told that the justification for closing this office is that the foot traffic has decreased over the last 12 months. We know the reason for this. It's not because people don't want to come into a local Centrelink office and have their issues dealt with; it's because, when they go into the local Centrelink office at Warrawong and want to have their issues dealt with, they are told, 'I'm sorry, this is too complex for us to deal with—you'll have to go into Wollongong or you'll have to contact our call centre to have this issue dealt with.' Anybody in this House will be able to tell you that contacting a Centrelink call centre is not as easy as just picking up the phone and getting through. Average wait times have blown out to around half an hour. And, if English isn't your second language, that is a very difficult issue indeed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision to close this office is not the first time that the coalition have attempted to do these sorts of things. They have form. In the 1996 budget, the Howard government closed the Medicare office in Warrawong and moved it to Wollongong. I was very pleased to be in Warrawong with the member for Cunningham when the Labor government reopened the Medicare office there in 2009, only now to see this government attempting to close it again. At the same time, they attempted to close the Centrelink office. We opposed it and the community opposed it, and they won. The decision is a dumb one and it has to be reversed, and we're calling on the minister to intervene.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  In my view, the word 'hero' is bandied around far too often. In fact, we hear about heroes in sport on a daily basis. It might be a fleeting engagement, but ultimately we hear them referred to as having that hero status. Today in this chamber I want to talk about someone who has become a hero of mine. He was an AFL footballer. He played some 192 games for the St Kilda and Fremantle football clubs. But it's not his prowess on the field that makes him a hero of mine; it's what he has done since his career ended. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This person is Heath Black. Heath Black was a talented footballer. He played those 192 games, as I said. But, during his career, he played with undiagnosed bipolar disorder and ADHD. What that meant was that, throughout his career, he self-medicated with alcohol. After his career, without the rigours and routines of a football club, his life ran off the rails. He would tell you as much if he were standing here right now. In fact, it is the fact that he is going around the country telling people his story that makes him a hero for me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I went to a presentation he gave recently at the Imperial Football Club, as part of Murray-Mallee Local Drug Action Team and, in particular, the Murray Bridge Safe committee. To be honest, all I could say afterwards was, 'Mate, that's incredibly brave.' I'll tell you what was brave about it. He was saying: 'Here's a photo of a bloke at the end of his footy career. He looks strong; he looks fit; he looks like he's on top of the world.' He was telling those young people in that football club who looked at him as a footballer that that wasn't the true story. The true story was that that man was an alcoholic. He was living in the back of his car, and his life was running out of control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Heath, through sheer effort, has got his life back on track. He is contributing significantly around the community, as I said. He credits a doctor who took an interest in him and helped him over six years—diagnosed his condition and medicated it correctly. Heath is healthy, he is strong and, from what I saw over the last week, he's really a hero. It reminds me of the need to ensure we appropriately fund general practitioners and train them correctly to understand these types of problems. All I can say to Heath is: 'Mate, what you do is unbelievable. You're incredibly brave. Keep it up.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  Mr Deputy Speaker, this is an opportunity for members to talk about issues of concern to constituents in their electorates. Well, let me tell you, the constituents in my electorate are very, very angry today. Just over a week ago, the member for Whitlam and I were informed by Centrelink management that they were shutting the office at Warrawong, an office in amongst some of the most disadvantaged suburbs in the state, with elderly people who need assistance, unemployed people who need assistance and young mums, with toddlers and babies, who need to be able to put forms in for childcare payments and so forth. The government have taken this decision against the best interests of all those people. They have the opportunity to overturn that decision, and we are calling on the minister to intervene urgently. We were told that the office would shut by the end of July. We don't have a lot of time and we need the minister to give urgent attention to this matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Whitlam and I have started a petition in order to bring this to the government's attention and to indicate how angry people are. Let me share the words of some of our locals about this, from the local media and my Facebook page. Mr George Bartolo, who is the senior vice-chairman of the Multicultural Communities Council of Illawarra, said that going elsewhere, including online, wasn't a simple task. Don't we know that, George! That's absolutely true. He said the closure was a 'huge loss'. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The migrants that came here in the fifties, there were just about no services whatsoever. Now they're elderly … and now we put them behind the eight-ball again to access services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alice Scott, from Berkeley, was among those who campaigned against the closure under John Howard, and we are now fighting it again under a conservative government. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's about … the elderly non-English speaking migrants; they came here, they've worked all their lives, most of the husbands have passed on but the women are still out there, they don't drive—how are they going to get to Wollongong?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She stressed that the lack of parking near Centrelink in Wollongong was a barrier, as was the cost involved in catching public transport into Wollongong from Warrawong. Craig, on my Facebook page, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Most of you who know me are aware of my political views but this decision is one I can't agree with. A place like Warrawong requires this office to support the obvious need. Expecting the patrons to travel to Wollongong is not realistic or in anyone's interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">This is an area where so many people need this facility. It would be an act of bastardry to take it away. What else would one expect from a Coalition Government that has such a high disregard and contempt for any one in need …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… there are so many older immigrants around here that would struggle without a Centrelink here if they had issues with their pension and even myself if I have to go to Wollongong or Shellharbour …</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  I rise this morning to raise serious concerns about the Victorian Labor government's failure to fund a number of schools in the Corangamite electorate which have urgent infrastructure needs. Under our government's Gonski 2.0 needs based funding plan, we're delivering an additional $23.5 billion to Australian schools over 10 years. The Commonwealth provides 20 per cent of the funding to government schools, the states and territories provide the rest, and it is the states, in the case of Victoria, the Victorian Daniel Andrews government, which determine how this funding is spent. In Corangamite, our funding to government schools increases from $40.1 million this year to $48.8 million in four years time and then grows to $63.1 million in 2027. That's record and growing funding, which makes the campaign by the likes of the Australian Education Union false and a farce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where there is genuine unfairness is in Premier Daniel Andrews's discriminatory and inequitable decision not to provide capital funding to a number of schools in desperate need. I was very pleased to meet with the school council at Bellbrae Primary School with the member for South Barwon, Andrew Katos. The school needs between $6 million and $8 million for new classrooms, a new gym, art room, music room and library. Bellbrae now has more than 500 students. It's a growing school, which Labor has all but ignored. Every school with more than 350 students in Victoria is meant to have its own gym, so why is Labor turning its back on Bellbrae and other schools and breaking its own rules? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bellaire Primary School in Highton, with more than 600 students, is also desperate for more infrastructure. It's so desperate for more classrooms that it is currently using hallways to extend their classroom spaces. The Bellaire school president, Steve Knuckey, believes the school needs $10 million in infrastructure upgrades urgently, but none of this was in the recent state budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Winchelsea Primary School—which the member for Polwarth, Richard Riordan, and I visited late last week—a small capital grant of $352,000 to upgrade the library and fix the roof will be eaten up largely by the cost of asbestos removal. The asbestos must be removed from the school, but the Winchelsea school community should not have to pay the price, which is an estimated $100,000. This is simply not good enough and, again, I call on Premier Daniel Andrews to fund the cost of asbestos removal in addition to the capital funding which has been provided. The Victorian Labor government need to provide fair and equitable funding to all schools in Corangamite.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FITZGIBBON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  In around September of 2013 Denman resident Stephen Ward suffered a terrible stroke. He wasn't yet 50 years of age. Stephen's recovery has been slow, painful and frustrating. It hasn't stopped him, though, from his ongoing commitment to his local community, including his ongoing service to Muswellbrook Shire Council as an elected councillor. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His rock through his trials has been his family and, in particular, his wife Tracy. Tracy Ward is an amazing human being. In fact she often seems somewhat beyond human—a superwoman, possibly. For all of her adult life, Tracy has been an energetic contributor to her local community. That didn't change when family life grew busier and it didn't change when Stephen suffered his terrible stroke. She has had the tenacity to negotiate every hurdle of bureaucracy which has been placed in her path from Centrelink and the health system, which let them down the day of Stephen's stroke, right through to the NDIS. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very proud of Tracy, who—for full disclosure, I should say, is a member of the Australian Labor Party, as is Stephen—shared their experiences here in Parliament House in front of the Minister for Health, the Shadow minister for health and many senior MPs and senators. You imagine, then, how angry I was to learn two weeks ago that Tracy had received a debt-recovery demand letter from Centrelink. The amount was $39,581.13. Tracy received that letter late in the afternoon after returning from work. She had to sleep on that letter. She sent me an email overnight. I contacted her very early the next morning and said, 'Centrelink's not open for business, but I'm aware of your email and I'll be on the job at the first opportunity.' Typical of Tracy, she said, 'No, I've got to take Stephen for rehab, and after that I'll visit Centrelink in Muswellbrook and see whether I can clarify the situation myself.' It turns out Centrelink had the wrong Tracy Ward. Tracy Ward has no debt to Centrelink, thank goodness, but imagine if someone less tough or less calm than Tracy Ward had received that letter. I can only imagine what the ramifications could have been for some. We've all been aware of the robo-debt recovery process and the way in which Centrelink has been gutted by this government. I stand by Centrelink staff. I know they are doing it tough in difficult circumstances, but what happened to Tracy Ward was a disgrace.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  I commend the member for Farrer on the introduction of this important bill, the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill 2018. I also commend her and her co-sponsors for the courage they have shown in difficult circumstances. It is never easy to rally against your party's own policy position, and it is even more courageous to pursue the issue down the path of a private member's bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that the morality the live sheep trade relies upon is fundamentally broken. It has three basic flaws. First, it is reliant on the dreaded Northern Hemisphere summer trade—a trade which is completely incompatible with reasonable animal welfare standards. The science leaves us in no doubt about that. Second, the trade externalises animal welfare cruelty. The premiums earned by exporters as a result of cruel conditions, like excessive stocking densities, are externalised in the form of higher than normal payments to sheepmeat producers. This, of course, has the added disadvantage of putting at a disadvantage domestic processors here in Australia. Third, consumer preferences and community tolerance for the poor treatment of animals are both turning away from the live sheep model. The writing is on the wall, in any case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a statement of fact to say that members and senators from a majority of parties represented in this parliament have now expressed support for the provisions within this bill, and they are important provisions. What this bill would do, first of all, is put an immediate stop to that northern summer trade: that practice of jamming tens of thousands of live sheep onto a vessel for a three- or four-week voyage in the hottest and most humid climatic conditions in the world. That has to stop. Second, it would phase out the balance of the trade over a five-year period, providing the sector with sufficient time to make the transition. When I say 'the sector', I'm talking mainly about those sheepmeat producers who have become dependent on the live-export trade for—in part at least—their livelihood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very strongly of the view that, with the right strategic red meat industry plan, we can assist sheepmeat producers in making that transition, to take them to a better place both in animal welfare terms and in terms of sustainable profitability. And, at the same time, we can create a structure in this country which allows us to do more value-adding here in Australia, creating more jobs in Australia. So this strategic red meat plan will be good for sheepmeat producers, it will be good for the Australian economy, it will be good for Australian jobs, and, of course, it will produce better animal welfare standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know the reality of the difficulty in getting the member for Farrer's bill through this parliament. The Senate—not so difficult, in my view. I'm very confident about its prospects there. In fact, today, a bill pretty much replicating the member for Farrer's bill is being introduced into the Senate, so we'll give the parliament plenty of opportunities. But it will be difficult because the government will not give preference to either of these bills in the House, and, of course, to have them voted upon in the House will require an absolute majority. I was going to provide the parliament with yet another opportunity, and I've foreshadowed my intention of moving amendments to the bill proposed by the government which increases penalties in the live export trade. To secure support in the House for that amendment will only require, of course, a simple majority. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has happened to that bill now? The government has pulled the bill from the legislative program to save the risk of losing those amendments in the House. If the government is confident of my amendment being defeated, it should just bring the bill on. We can only assume, as it withholds the bill, that it's not confident of defeating my amendments in the House. In other words, it's pushing against the will of the House of Representatives. It's clear this is the will of the House of Representatives. It's clear a number of members of the Liberal Party want to support me and the member for Farrer, and they should be allowed to do so.</span>

                    <a href="M3M" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Farrer for bringing forward the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill 2018 and this important debate. Astute listeners will note that the area of Bennelong is quite ovinely challenged. In fact, to my knowledge, there is not one sheep domiciled in the corner of Sydney that I represent, but that doesn't mean people in my electorate don't care deeply about this issue. In the last few years, I've had hundreds of locals contact me to express their concerns with this ongoing trade. They demand their concerns be addressed. On the other side of this argument are the farmers who depend on live sheep exports for their ongoing livelihood. To stop the exports tonight would bring devastation to their families. Maintaining this policy may hurt some sheep but will save farmers. Stopping it helps sheep but hurts farmers. We need to move to a policy where both are safe, but, in this matter, as in many, the art of transition is key.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Politics is often a battle of heads against hearts. It's easy and tempting to take an emotive line on many issues, but government must always be led by facts. Governing should involve an information led, rational compromise that allows everybody to get ahead. For this reason, I am opposed to the policy put forward by the Labor Party. Stopping exports without a clear, thought-through time frame would devastate the industry and leave farmers destitute. This is a bad policy that will hurt families across our regions. At the same time, this is why I feel, if properly implemented, a policy like the member for Farrer's is sensible. A five-year transition period would allow time for the market to prepare for the impact of this policy while alleviating the most extreme of the shipboard conditions. The last Labor government almost destroyed the cattle industry with its overnight shutdown, and we can't make the same mistakes they did. I'll defer to the member for Farrer on the finer points of agricultural policy, but I would hope that five years would be enough time to make the relevant changes for farmers across the country. If this time is not economically viable, it can be amended, but it would seem a fair period of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This phasing-out process would need to echo many of the policies already implemented by the government, and it is pleasing to note that the government has accepted all recommendations from the McCarthy review of sheep exports to the Middle East during the northern summer, which was released on 17 May 2018. Facts show us that live sheep exports are now safer than they have ever been before. More sheep actually die on road transports than at sea. The government can be congratulated for the great improvements made to the trade by making it safer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that the value of live sheep exports has decreased dramatically over the past few years, which has been confirmed by the department of agriculture. Live exports are now only six per cent of the total sheep turn-off. The other 94 per cent is processed, packaged and frozen domestically before being exported. The extra processing employs more Australians and makes economic sense. In 2016-17, the total global value of Australian lamb was $1.9 billion, and mutton was worth $719 million. Both lamb and mutton value have increased dramatically from 2010-11 figures, reflecting growing demand and the opening up of new markets such as China. Most of this growth is in the frozen product. So there is a market here that we can expand into and capitalise on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The art of transition is the most important skill in politics and one we need to get much better at. Knee-jerk responses to crises are never sustainable and usually hurt more people than they help. This seems like a sensible policy of transition and, so long as it stacks up economically, the government should consider it further. The countering views have been expressed. It is now time to settle on common sense.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  At the outset, I commend the member for Farrer for having the courage to introduce this bill, and those of her colleagues who have supported her. In my understanding of my community, I would summarise the community attitude to this as being: 'enough is enough'. After all the outrage, the numerous reviews, the years of hand-wringing, and the stalling, it's time that the parliament acted decisively and passed this private member's bill, to end the live sheep export trade once and for all. It is an issue that crosses the political divide. It matters in the cities, it matters in the towns, it matters in the bush. No Australian who has seen the latest footage could be anything but appalled and horrified. We cannot unsee this. We cannot just turn away. We should not be cramming live sheep into boiling metal ships and casting them out in the Indian Ocean for weeks on end, in the hopes of propping up an already failing industry. The reality is that there is no way to regulate this trade that will prevent animals dying cruelly at sea. As the member for Farrer said when she introduced this bill: 'Regulations written on paper in Australia cease to mean anything once the ship departs.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's weak response just makes things a little bit less awful. At best, the government's policy will give the sheep a bit more space: an extra A3 sheet of paper—a better class of cruelty, if you like. It's a tacit admission by the government that they're going to keep letting sheep be slowly cooked alive. That may sound shocking. It's appalling language, if you think about the reality of what that means. But, listening to those opposite, who continue in tortuous bits of flawed logic to defend the indefensible, it wouldn't surprise me if one of them jumped up and said: 'Look, I think we need to innovate this industry. We'll export the missing tomatoes and rosemary and garlic, and they can be pre-cooked meals on arrival.' The state of those sheep is nothing short of disgusting when they arrive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Should this bill pass, it will end the live-export trade in the hot Northern Hemisphere summer months and phase out the trade altogether over the subsequent five years. For years now, the government has used the issue of live sheep exports as an electoral wedge, so that anyone speaking up on this and expressing a view somehow means they are antifarmers or antitrade. The tenure of the former Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable member for New England and minister for agriculture, was disgraceful. He didn't just do nothing—he actually took pride in weakening and undermining the existing protections for animal welfare. The initial reaction from the current minister to the latest footage was positive and strong, but it was a short-lived breath of fresh air, in my opinion. Sadly, he has gone back to normal programming. The government's lack of moral compass is seen in its crab walk away from any real action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review was headed by a veterinarian who works for the industry, and it is a profound disappointment. With respect to my colleague the member for Bennelong, the government haven't adopted all of the review's weak recommendations. They've said they accept them, but they won't implement them. It's tricky words. You say you accept, but won't do. Nothing changes. This is particularly so with recommendation 4, which would have practically ended the live sheep export trade in the sweltering Northern Hemisphere summer. So it's unclear to anyone outside the cabinet whether the minister has caved to the industry, was rolled in cabinet or just lost his spine, which seems to be a fairly common thing for those opposite when they enter the Turnbull cabinet. But, whatever happened, he has precious little to be proud of—he's certainly no misnomer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The overwhelming scientific and economic evidence supports ending this trade. The Australian Veterinary Association, the RSPCA and countless animal welfare groups have told us that there is simply no way that the northern summer sheep trade can continue if animal welfare considerations are to be adequately met. And the economists have told us there's simply no long-term future for this failing industry. It's been in decline for over two decades. So, as legislators, we should act now to ensure the welfare of Australian animals and to provide transitional support, in a timetable, for farmers who currently rely on the industry for their livelihood. There've been some people in animal welfare groups who've said five years is too long; others have said it's long enough. In reality, the five-year period probably strikes a reasonable and correct balance in allowing farmers and exporters time to transition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in summary, we can stop this cruel trade. We must stop this cruel trade. The moral, scientific and economic case is clear. The evidence requires us as legislators to act. The community have had enough, and Australia's international reputation will be damaged if we don't act. Allowing this to continue is not who we are as a people.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  I rise to oppose this private member's bill, the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill 2018, on four grounds: firstly, the effect it will have on the hardworking farmers, truck drivers, stock agents and ancillary industries such as pellet manufacturers, who rely heavily on the live export trade for their livelihoods; secondly, the loss of the positive impact the ESCAS has had on animal welfare outcomes for not only Australian animals but all animals in destination countries; thirdly, the wider trade implications with the Middle East; and, finally, the live sheep trade in the Middle East is much larger than Australian supply, so our animals will be substituted with animals from sub-Saharan Africa, the Black Sea and South America.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The live export trade is worth around $250 million to the Australian economy, with over 85 per cent of this income generated from WA, largely from my electorate. After the closure of the live export trade in 2011, prices for shipping wethers fell from the $80 to $100 per head range to $5 per head, recovering to the $20 to $30 a head range in the months following. This of course dragged the entire sheep market down by over 50 per cent and sent many businesses to the wall. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have received hundreds of emails from constituents who have been suffering great uncertainty and anxiety over the future of their businesses following the introduction of this private member's bill. Many farmers, like me, were shocked to see the animals they had raised and nurtured suffer due to the extreme weather event on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span>. But it's worth noting that live export mortalities currently average 0.7 per cent per voyage, compared to 1.9 per cent in the 1990s. So this is a massive improvement over the last 15 years. This can be compared to Australian annual grazing losses of up to five per cent. One farmer reminded me: 'Mother Nature imposes things on us that can cause livestock losses, despite our best intentions.' Livestock transporter Andy Jacobs sits on the committee of the Livestock and Rural Transport Association of WA. He states that over 25 per cent of their members will be adversely affected by any industry closure, and many are only just recovering from the 2011 shutdown. Andy also provided this sobering reminder: 'Human life is important too. In 2011 we lost good people to suicide as a direct result of the loss of this trade, let alone the animals that needed to be destroyed.'</span>

                    </a>  I give the Labor Party credit for that, Joel. What will happen to the sheep from countries with less stringent welfare requirements? Middle Eastern countries import around 10 million sheep per annum, of which Australia contributes only 1.6 to 1.8 million. Contrary to assertions that this market is shrinking, global food company GIRA forecasts that demand will increase by 2.5 per cent per annum between now and 2022.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Saudi market accounts for around 56 per cent of the world live sheep market and sits outside the ESCAS. Prior to 2009, these sheep came largely from Australia, but the bulk of these sheep are now sourced primarily from Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan. The assumption that ceasing live exports will simply drive substitution to chilled Australian meat is incorrect. We only have to look to Bahrain to see that in 2015, when the live export market became unviable due to changes to government subsidies, MLA figures showed that our chilled meat exports have shrunk from 11,987 tonnes in 2014 to 7,423 tonnes in 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that live export is actually increasing. Comparisons have been made between New Zealand and Australia, but New Zealand has always been a prime lamb producer and has never had a substantial live export industry. Australia, on the other hand, is primarily a wool-producing nation with mutton meat a lower valued by-product for domestic consumption. Chilled mutton is worth roughly half of what chilled lamb is. Livestock Shipping Services exports both live and chilled meat from WA to the Middle East. LSS recently purchased export shippers from WA farmers for over $100 a head, but managing director Paul Keenan informed me that, if these shippers were slaughtered at the Hillside abattoir in Narrogin, they would have only returned around $70 per head. General manager Ahmad Ghosheh added that the current capacity to move chilled product to the Middle East is full and that it will continue to diminish with the withdrawal of Etihad Airways daily flight from Perth to the Middle East.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, last month Al Mawashi, the Kuwaiti livestock transport and trading company that buys most of the 1.8 million live sheep exported from Australia, warned of wider ramifications for Australian agricultural commodities. CEO Usama Boodai stated:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… doubts about Australian sheep means Al Mawashi is already looking to find other secure sources of livestock—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">in countries such as Somalia and Romania. He also said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This could also bring into question the significant volumes of fodder we import for feeding Australian sheep in our feedlots, as well as the chilled and frozen sheep meat we also import.</span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />In closing, I commend the minister for the strong stand he has taken with the imposition of stricter stocking density rates, independent observers on all voyages and significantly increased financial penalty. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When one thinks about what makes this planet so special, it's the thought of the great natural wonders spread across its surface. From the Grand Canyon in the United States to Mount Everest in Nepal, humans are in constant awe of the power, beauty and spectacle of the truly incredible things Mother Nature is capable of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1997, American news service CNN compiled its list of the Seven Natural Wonders of the world—there are just seven examples around the globe that stand alone as magnificent examples of nature, offering both beauty and power. The list followed in the footsteps of previous well-known lists such as the Seven Wonders of the World which featured the most significant examples of man-made magnificence—structures such as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the Great Pyramids of Giza.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each time any person or organisation creates a list of the most important, unique natural wonders, the Great Barrier Reef is always sure to factor. Stretching some 2,300 kilometres along the tropical east coast of the great state of Queensland, the reef, as we affectionately know it, is the size of a mountain range and as vibrant as a carnival. It is the world's largest coral reef, home to thousands of species of coral, and fish, birds, whales, dugongs and plankton. It is an integral resource for not only Capricornia and Queensland but also the national economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm proud to represent the fishers, tour operators and moteliers et cetera of my electorate who rely so directly on the Great Barrier Reef, the story is a much broader and compelling one across the reef's whole footprint. For thousands of years Australians have relied on the bounty provided by the reef. Modern Australia is no different. A 2017 report conducted by Deloitte Australia placed the value of the Great Barrier Reef as a not-to-be-sneezed-at $6.4 billion and estimated its effect on the workforce to be in the value of 64,000 direct and indirect jobs. These are huge figures, figures that must not be ignored. I'm pleased to know that they are not being ignored by this coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that, unlike that of those opposite when they were in power, identifies issues and deals with them in a pragmatic manner. We don't just get sad and signal our virtue. We get in and address the real issues. Among the reef's greatest identified threats are run-off pollution and the crown-of-thorns starfish. The recent announcement of $500 million towards addressing these threats was met with open arms recently by two groups in my local community—tourism operators and farmers. The latter may surprise you, but it is our farmers and graziers who have made huge inroads into addressing run-off. Since the Howard government's reef package of well over a decade ago natural resource organisation and landholders have been working together to lighten their impact on the reef. Simple projects like putting in extra water points, fencing off creeks and utilising more-sophisticated spraying techniques make a big difference to what and how much makes its way downstream and onto the reef. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that managing run-off is key to keeping water quality high and the crown-of-thorns numbers low. These projects also have the added benefit of helping landholders better manage their land, in turn driving further economic benefit. Increasing ground cover means not only less dirt runs away but more moisture is held within the soil—grass can grow more quickly and more stock can feed from the same area. Using more-sophisticated techniques for herbicides or fertilisers not only means less chance of these chemicals running off onto the reef but also means landholders are able to use less to do more, saving more money while increasing output.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This means that while these policies are addressing the real factors for the reef's health they are also improving the productivity and resilience of our rural communities. It is an approach very different to those opposite, who have effectively shut down our rural communities for the sake of the reef, placing ideology ahead of a pragmatic solution. The greatest threats to the reef are being addressed by this government, and with $500 million on the table I am confident we can continue to see improvements. I wholeheartedly endorse the government's strategy to address the perils facing one of the world's seven natural wonders and look forward to getting home to enjoy its tropical waters.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E09" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms OWENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  Our magnificent Great Barrier Reef, the only living thing on the planet visible from the moon, is a living natural resource that should be cherished and protected, but this coalition government is failing to protect the reef from every angle. We know that the biggest threat to the Great Barrier Reef is climate change, but what have we seen from that side of the House? We have seen not only that they have undone what Labor did when it was in government but inaction since then, and we've seen emissions rise by 1.4 per cent in the last year. The government's own emissions projections show that Australia will not even come close to meeting our obligations under the Paris agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government's weak emissions reduction target of the National Energy Guarantee there will be very little large-scale investment in renewable energy for the entire decade of the 2020s. Carbon pollution data confirms pollution is rising and will continue to rise under this government's policies all the way to 2030. This government's budget saw not one measure to tackle climate change, not a single cent spent on new climate change policy. You can't be serious about saving the reef without a serious plan to tackle climate change, but Prime Minister Turnbull is too busy pandering to the conservative climate change deniers to take action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reef is also an economic issue. Tourism employs around 225,000 Queenslanders, both directly and indirectly. The Great Barrier Reef alone supports 64,000 full-time jobs, and these people rely on a healthy, thriving reef. Deloitte Access Economics estimates the value of our greatest natural treasure, the Barrier Reef, is $56 billion. In addition, the report estimates the reef contributed $6.4 billion to the Australian economy in 2015-16. For communities that rely on tourism for local jobs there will be immense economic consequences if the reef deteriorates. In fact, we've already seen a drop-off in tourism numbers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One way to protect the reef is through marine parks, but Australia's network of marine parks has been gutted by this government. No matter which way you look at it, the government has now spent four years engaging in the largest removal of area from conservation protection in Australia's history. The Coral Sea has gone from being the jewel in the crown of the Commonwealth marine parks, protecting the eastern side of the Great Barrier Reef, to now being a haven for long-lining and trawling, the same method used by the supertrawler. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in my electorate are very concerned about the environment, marine parks and the reef. More than 350 people have emailed me about marine parks in the past few months alone, and Labor have serious concerns about the Great Barrier Reef funding announcement in the budget. The government wants to give itself a pat on the back for that $500 million in the budget, but $444 million of that is in a grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, and that process has been chaotic at best. The extent to which the Great Barrier Reef Foundation was properly consulted and prepared for an increase in funding of this scale is not clear. After all, it hasn't turned over more than $10 million per year in the last two years, and going from $10 million to $444 million is a massive increase in scale.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister repeatedly confirmed during Senate estimates that the foundation did not submit an application, and a competitive process tender was not followed. How is this possible for one of Australia's greatest natural assets? It is not clear that the foundation is even able to cope with a grant of this size, and there is no plan—and there was no plan when the $440 million grant was announced. That is why Labor are making a freedom-of-information request about the funding provided for the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. We want to protect the Barrier Reef. It's globally significant, it's a natural wonder, and we should put in our best efforts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor were in government, we introduced a carbon trading scheme and we also set up the marine parks—the largest marine park network in the world, and it's something that I was very proud of. It's quite tragic to see this government rip that progress apart and then sit on its hands for so long. We have seen serious bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef over the last couple of years. The reef itself is in danger from climate change. It's just tragic for the entire world, really, that this government isn't taking more action. I strongly urge the members on that side to rethink their position on this and take real action on climate change.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  There's no doubt about it; the Great Barrier Reef is the greatest living natural wonder on our planet, and I'm fortunate enough to represent a very large portion of that natural wonder, a very significant amount of which the previous speaker was talking about in relation to the impacts of bleaching. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than just having read some of the stuff that you see being released by the nay-sayers, I actually have a lot of experience on the ground. A lot of my businesses are heavily reliant on the health of the Barrier Reef. It doesn't do anybody any favours, neither us as managers nor businesses that rely on it, when you get this nonsense that's being continually perpetuated by groups that are out there pushing their own agendas. They're creating very, very colourful videos about the fact that the reef is dying, when nothing could be further from the truth. But they're doing it, playing to their own audiences. I tell you now, they would never, ever play those videos up in my electorate, because we know the facts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You've got the likes of the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Wilderness Society, the WWF and others pushing these things. The whole thing looks more like a fundraising campaign, because they're playing to very gullible audiences in metropolitan areas, most of whom have never, ever seen and do not understand the facts relating to the reef. But they do it as a very effective fundraiser, as they race out there with their underpants on the outside and capes on, saying, 'We're going to save the reef.' The reef does not require saving. It requires very good management. We are seen already as the best reef managers in the world, and it's important that we continue to be the best reef managers in the world. I say that because I have a real strong interest in the reef, as does my electorate. More than 64,000 jobs and about $6.4 billion of our economy—a very significant part of our economy—are reliant on a healthy reef. It's the biggest economic driver in my electorate; it's one of the biggest employers in my electorate. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say I get very, very angry when I see these groups out there constantly talking the reef down. They can be talking about the challenges that we have, certainly. We talk about coral bleaching—it's not something we do here in Australia that causes the coral bleaching. It comes from hot currents that come across the waters from South America. It's what happens in China, in India, in the US, in the Northern Hemisphere, that impacts on that. We should be making noises about it, but we're doing a hell of a lot of good work here in Australia mitigating those challenges. We're not able to stop it, until they start dealing with climate change issues in the Northern Hemisphere, where our large polluters are, but we certainly can help to manage it and show others. We're doing that by getting heat-resistant corals. This is some of the work that's been done from the $444 billion—close to half a billion—that's been recently announced. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also noticed that there was some criticism regarding the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. The foundation is a very credible organisation. It's highly respected and has had an outstanding history in relation to the handling of government funds. It's not going to be spending the $444 million; that money will be disbursed out to those wonderful people that are doing the crown-of-thorns starfish work and a whole range of other credible organisations. The foundation is basically just holding that money and dispensing it out to others, and it's certainly more capable to do that than most. It's very unfair and unreasonable that it should be criticised—it's a highly reputable not-for-profit organisation. I think it makes a lot of sense that it's able to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to say again that we have to be very, very careful when criticising. Every time we start criticising, we're talking it down, and we are then allowing others to make assumptions that what is being published is true; it is not. We are great reef managers. People come looking to us for advice from around the world. A lot of the campaigns out there against the reef are actually campaigns against fossil fuel, and they see the reef as collateral damage. I applaud the work that we've done, and let's continue to make sure that we do so.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  Sir David Attenborough has travelled to every corner of the globe, but if you ask him to name the most magical place on earth, he responds: the Great Barrier Reef. The reef is an extraordinary ecosystem that contains largest collection of coral reefs—400 types of coral and 1,500 species of fish exist in the reef. There is no other World Heritage property which contains this level of biodiversity. The environmental significance of the reef simply cannot be overstated. But the reef is also an economic asset for the nation. Deloitte have placed the value of the reef at some $56 billion. They measured its contribution to the Australian economy at $6.4 billion in 2015-16, supporting some 64,000 jobs that are a direct result of the Great Barrier Reef, particularly in the tourism sector. The reef is a cornerstone of our tourism economy, and not just in Far North Queensland. It also plays an important role in our national economy, because people who visit Australia visit it, in part, because of the Great Barrier Reef, but they also spend money in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and other parts of the nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is almost ironic, given the government's record on the Great Barrier Reef, because it is this government that wants to lock in the largest removal of conservation areas anywhere in the world, in history. The Labor government instituted Australia's marine park network, comprising the largest network of marine protected areas in the world. This government has plans to strip away swathes of protected areas from these marine parks, making Australia the only country anywhere on the globe that's actually reducing the protection of its oceans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government awarded a $444 million donation to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, it must be said that no application was received and no competitive tender process was undertaken. The Great Barrier Reef Foundation is a reputable organisation, but its previous revenues, going back to 2015 of $9.6 million, and in 2016 $8 million, indicate that it is far from clear if the organisation simply has the capacity to cope with an investment of this size. It's symbolic of the government's chaotic management of this World Heritage listed ecosystem. The fact is this mismanagement hasn't just been bad for the environment; it is also letting down the communities that rely on the Great Barrier Reef for their income. We need a real plan to protect the reef and to protect our oceans. Of course, part of that has to be taking action on climate change, because that is the biggest threat to the ecosystem of the Great Barrier Reef. That's why Labor's committed to taking real action on climate change, with a commitment, for example, to 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030, with a commitment to actually reduce our emissions. That was happening up to 2013, but now, of course, under this government's farcical version of energy policy, where they can't even agree with themselves after more than five years, we don't have an energy policy in this country, and emissions are rising again on this government's watch. The fact is that the budget in May didn't deliver a single dollar on new climate change policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I want to conclude by echoing again the words of Sir David Attenborough, 'Do we really care so little about the earth upon which we live that we don't wish to protect one of its greatest wonders from the consequences of our behaviours?' This much is clear: our reef does need protection, and this government simply isn't up to the job of providing it. That requires a comprehensive plan on climate change. It requires a comprehensive plan to reduce run-off into the reef. It requires a comprehensive plan to support the tourism sector in Far North and North Queensland. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHRISTENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  It's interesting that the previous speaker, the honourable member, highlighted the government's half-a-billion-dollar investment in the reef, which we've just made to actually reduce run-off and fund further research into the reef. Contrary to reports from GetUp! and the Greens, the reef isn't dead and it's not covered in toxic sludge. It is very much alive, and it's being enjoyed by thousands of Australians and thousands of international tourists, who haven't been driven away by the extreme Greens' attacks on the reef's reputation. According to a Deloitte report, the Great Barrier Reef is credited with supporting 64,000 jobs directly and indirectly. In all the regions bordering the Great Barrier Reef the reef creates more than 19,000 tourism jobs. That's locally. As a comparison, the resource sector also creates about 19,000 jobs, but that's just in the Mackay region alone, with a further 12,000 created in the Fitzroy or Central Queensland region. The coal industry in Queensland generates thousands upon thousands of jobs. The reef is also responsible for some of those jobs, because workers move to our part of the world to take up jobs that flow from mining dollars, but they also come because of lifestyle, having fishing, diving and island-hopping opportunities. The reef also creates 680 local jobs in the fishing industry, a further 2,889 in recreational industries and 895 in scientific research. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the great pleasure of visiting the Australian Institute of Marine Science in the north of my electorate last week. It's Australia's tropical marine research agency, heavily involved in research based around the reef. The CEO there, Dr Paul Hardisty, showed me some of the projects they were working on, including research to find and breed hardier, more resilient corals that can stand different environmental conditions. The ultimate goal would then be to seed the reef with new and hardier coral after an impact causes coral loss. As we've seen through the history of the reef, the most destructive forces that affect the coral come from cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. As I said at the start, the Liberal-National government recently provided half a billion dollars for reef protection, including a $444 million investment through the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, a very reputable organisation that has been slandered a little bit in this place—it's bizarre, actually. The foundation has worked very closely with the Australian Institute of Marine Science.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Successive governments, both state and national, have invested billions of dollars in reef protection, because management of the reef is important—it's a national icon. However, its iconic status is the very reason why you get these extremists out there, using it as a weapon to fight an ideological agenda. GetUp! and the extreme green groups, for instance, make claims about water run-off from the Carmichael mine. Apparently, that is water run-off that's going to kill the reef—even though the mine is hundreds of kilometres and a mountain range away from the coastline, and even further away from the nearest reef. We do things differently up in North Queensland, I'll admit that, but we can't actually run water uphill—not naturally, anyway. The same extremists, supported by Labor and the Greens in this place, and supported by the taxpayer-funded ABC, use the reef to beat up the mining industry and also our farmers, particularly cane farmers, at every opportunity. They accuse miners of dumping toxic sludge on and digging up the reef, and they accuse farmers of covering the reef with chemicals and sediment—none of which is actually true. The extreme green groups use fake news to link farming with outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish on the reef. They don't mention the outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish over in WA, where there is no sugar cane farming, apart from a small section up in the top end. The truth is that mining and the GBR have existed for a very long time, and will exist for a long time to come. Farming and the GBR have existed for a long time, fishing and the GBR have existed for a long time—thousands of years—since the Indigenous people were doing it. It's easy for inner-city socialists to lecture people in north Queensland and tell them to shut down their industries that put food on the table. But the royalties and taxes go into the pockets of government, who actually build the stuff in the capital cities that those inner-city socialists want.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments, we had the extreme greens calling the shots, locking up a million square kilometres of some of the most under-fished waters in the world. On the one hand they're telling us they need to stop the GBR and the Coral Sea from being overfished; on the other hand they're telling us that the lock-out won't have a big impact because no-one goes fishing there. You can't have it both ways. If Labor and the Greens supported tourism on the reef, they'd support a tax change to open up superyacht industries. I look forward to them showing support for that, given they're going to be given an opportunity very soon.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  Queenslanders are lucky to have almost on our doorstep one of the seven wonders of the natural world, the Great Barrier Reef. While we know how precious the reef is, we also know how fragile it is. 2018 has been named the International Year of the Reef. This is a campaign to raise awareness of how each of us can choose to reduce the impacts of warming ocean temperatures and of the broader climate change effects on reef ecosystems worldwide. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority will be hosting and facilitating events for this campaign throughout the year, and I'm sure the member for Herbert will be involved with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is an important body, established by the Whitlam Labor government in 1975. Its purpose was and continues to be to properly manage the marine park area and protect its biodiversity for future generations. For the last 40 years, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has done just that, and I thank the authority for its skilled and strategic service. It has been recognised internationally for its management of the marine park—so I was completely flummoxed when the Turnbull-Morrison budget announced that a $444 million grant to boost reef protection would be awarded to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation and not to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Of course, I'm supportive of endeavours to protect our Great Barrier Reef. The reef's importance is beyond doubt, for our natural heritage, and for our tourism sector and the jobs associated with that, but any allocation of federal money should only be made with due diligence and full transparency, and with the national interest in mind, especially when this is the largest donation the Australian government has ever provided.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During Senate estimates, it was revealed that the Great Barrier Reef Foundation did not submit an application for the funding. A competitive tender process was not followed, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority may not have even been aware of the funding boost as recently as a week before the announcement. The government still has some questions to answer about this $444 million funding allocation. The Great Barrier Reef Foundation employs six full-time members and five part-time members. The revenue of the foundation for the previous two financial years was a mere $9.6 million and $8 million. The foundation itself has described this grant of $444 million as like winning the lotto. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In defence of the government's decision to make this grant, the environment minister reportedly said, 'The foundation has a strong board with a cross-section of eminent individuals from the academic, business and science community.' The board is chaired by a former chairman of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Dr John Schubert AO. Other board members include a former chairman of Goldman Sachs, a former president of the Business Council of Australia, a former CEO and managing director of Suncorp, other members with banking and corporation experience, as well as some scientists. However, in the past few weeks one member of the board of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, Stephen Roberts, has stepped down while a criminal investigation is underway over a suspicious capital raising for ANZ in 2015. Mr Roberts was a former director of the Australian Bankers' Association. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have more questions for this government and we're not getting the answers. An FOI request has been lodged to find out what discussions the government had regarding the funding to the Great Barrier Reef foundation, and why work of this scale, which would ordinarily be overseen by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, has been outsourced to this foundation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government has been disappointing in almost every respect, but their lack of action on climate change is arguably the most disappointing and will create the most long-lasting damage for our children and grandchildren. Prime Minister Turnbull famously said in 2009, 'I will not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am.' We know that climate change is the biggest threat to the Great Barrier Reef. Fragile coral reefs have been described as the canaries of the sea. They're the first to signal an impending larger problem. Coral bleaching can be the first sign of wider destructive global warming. Yet there is not a single cent in the 2018 budget committed to tackling climate change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government is a disgrace when it comes to looking after the environment. Since they took office in 2013, carbon emissions have risen six per cent. Compare that to six years under Labor, where emissions dropped 10 per cent. This Turnbull government stands for nothing. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to look after our precious environment. As President Macron of France said, 'There is no planet B.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A Shorten Labor government will prioritise tackling climate change. We'll encourage investment in renewable energy. We'll cut emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. We'll have zero emissions by 2050. We'll commit to 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030. In this motion before the chamber we have a long list of speakers from those opposite saying the reef is not in danger; however, aren't we great for giving half a billion to a small organisation. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The long-term protection and conservation of the Great Barrier Reef is critically important, and it is essential that it be preserved for future generations. That's why I and so many people in Brisbane were delighted that this year's federal budget made an additional investment, Australia's largest ever investment in the reef, of more than $500 million. This new funding is on top of the $2 billion that's already been allocated under this government to protect the reef. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In areas like conservation actions speak louder than words, so I'm proud that this government is doing more, investing more, funding more programs, than any other government in Australia's history. This record extends a long track record of support and protection of the Great Barrier Reef by former federal Liberal governments. It was, after all, the Fraser Liberal government that proclaimed the first section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in 1979, and it was the Fraser Liberal government again that nominated the Great Barrier Reef for World Heritage listing, leading to the World Heritage Committee placing it on the World Heritage List in 1981. The Howard government brought in the Great Barrier Reef Region (Prohibition of Mining) Regulations 1999 to prohibit mining in areas just outside the Great Barrier Reef region, falling outside the marine park. And it was also the Howard Liberal government that extended the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in 2000 to include six new sections right along the coastline of Queensland that were previously missing out on the park's protection status. That added almost 1,300 square kilometres to the park. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When this coalition government took office in 2013, we inherited a situation where, sadly, the Great Barrier Reef was on the UN World Heritage Committee's watch list, basically because Labor was proposing four sites there for the dumping of dredge spoils. The coalition put a stop to the dredge sites, and, happily, the Great Barrier Reef was then taken off the UN's watch list. That's the environmental record of action of which this government is rightly proud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course I'm pleased that this government is bringing in the next generation of marine parks, including new marine parks in the Coral Sea adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef. Once this government has finished this work, Australia will have one of the largest networks of marine sanctuaries around the world. I noted the comments of the earlier speaker the member for Grayndler. Where he is wrong in his assessment is that Labor never could bring the different stakeholders together. They didn't adequately base their initial proposals on the science. It was mostly politics and talk, rather than action—no results. This government is actually getting that job done. We've actually brought the stakeholders together and based it on the science, and therefore we will have these new marine parks very proudly as part of our environmental heritage when it comes to the Great Barrier Reef and marine parks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke in my maiden speech about my love for and connection with Australia's landscapes and environments. The Great Barrier Reef includes more than 2,900 coral reefs of different shapes and sizes, 600 islands, 300 coral cays and about 150 inshore mangrove islands. These sorts of landscapes and seascapes right around Australia, including the Great Barrier Reef, provide some of the most spectacular scenery and marine ecosystems on the planet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to draw out the fact that over $100 million of the new funding announced in the budget will go specifically to scientific research, to invest in cutting-edge scientific technologies that will build more resilient coral, to adapt and deal with some of the global pressures, including the heat and light stress that the Great Barrier Reef is currently subject to. Like reefs all around the world, the Great Barrier Reef is under pressure. That's why it's important that our good work in Australia in reef restoration is shared internationally, to help some of our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region to tackle this global challenge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This federal budget contained very welcome news for those of us who want to see our natural environment protected for future generations, as only a Liberal government has proven it can do. Conservation is inherently a conservative thing. Hopefully this record investment in the reef by the federal government will inspire even more Australians, including philanthropists and groups, to work together and build on the united efforts being made to protect and conserve the reef for generations to come.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'TOOLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  I stand here proudly as the member whose electorate is situated right on the Great Barrier Reef. The jobs, the tourism, the economy and the wonders that the Great Barrier Reef provides to my community clearly demonstrate that there is arguably no other entity that creates such diverse economies whilst being incredibly spectacular. I am immensely proud that one of the greatest wonders of the world is located, as I said, on my doorstep. So I must stand in this place and fight to protect the Barrier Reef from the Turnbull government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the member for Capricornia's first sentence in this motion reads 'that the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef is the planet’s greatest living wonder'. The question then must be asked: why are the member and her government determined to undermine and kill this great natural wonder? The Turnbull government is responsible for the largest removal of heritage listing in the entire world, and this is happening on our Great Barrier Reef. This government is responsible for removing and unwinding protections for the Great Barrier Reef, and it is putting at risk more than 70,000 jobs and billions upon billions of dollars that flow into the North Queensland economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is the party that protects the reef, and Labor will always be the party that fights for the reef. On top of removing vital protections, the Turnbull government have also given almost half a billion dollars to an organisation without any tenders, without knowing how many staff work at the organisation and without the organisation itself even asking for the funds. In Senate estimates, the Department of the Environment and Energy could not explain how or why $444 million is being allocated to one organisation, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget for the Great Barrier Reef Foundation will be increased by 45 times. Their revenue for 2015 and 2016 was $9.6 million and $8 million respectively. The foundation has only six full-time members and five part-time members, who have described this grant as 'like winning the lotto'. Almost half a billion in taxpayers' money should not be likened to winning the lotto for grant recipients. They should have prior knowledge, they should be invited to compete for that funding and it should be done in a transparent way. It is rare and surprising funding for one organisation with only six full-time staff. It begs the question: how will they manage such an influx in funding? Yet the Turnbull government is proposing to give that funding in one payment. This brings a whole new meaning to 'a fish out of water'. The cavalier attitude to the granting of $444 million taxpayer dollars without a public grant process, an open and transparent process, a competitive process or consideration of whether the authority, rather than the foundation, could have carried out this work shows arrogance and a complete lack of understanding of the importance of the Great Barrier Reef by the Turnbull government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think everybody can, and will, agree: something certainly smells fishy. And that is why federal Labor is making freedom of information requests into the Turnbull government's discussions regarding the funding to be provided to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation.

This was a very different scenario to what these soldiers endured when they returned home from Vietnam. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We remembered the Australian combat units that were engaged in the Vietnam War from 1962 to 1973 in response to a request for support from the Republic of Vietnam to the United States and its allies. We know the stories of the Vietnam War and the infamous song <span style="font-style:italic;">I Was Only Nineteen</span>, depicting the effects of the war and Agent Orange, but few know the details regarding these particular battles and their significance. The Battle of Coral and Balmoral took place between May and June 1968. Over the 25 days of fighting, this was one of the largest and most protracted battles fought by Australians during the course of the Vietnam War. The battles involved almost 3,000 men, and this was the first Australian all arms brigade-sized operation since World War II. The 1st and 3rd battalions Royal Australian Regiment, 102nd Field Battery Royal Australian Artillery, 161 Field Battery New Zealand deployed to FSB Coral on 12 May 1968. During the mini-Tet offensive mounted by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces in May 1968, the Australian task force was deployed to an area 20 kilometres north of Bien Hoa to intercept and disrupt enemy forces withdrawing from the capital, Saigon, and the Bien Hoa Long Binh base complex. Several fire support bases were established to defend firing points for artillery and mortars, which covered foot patrols sent out by the battalions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of these fire support bases was dubbed 'Coral'. It was situated seven kilometres north of the town of Tan Uyen. The 1st and 3rd battalions, RAR began preparing defensive positions, but these were incomplete when a North Vietnamese regiment attacked the base during the early hours of 13 May. The North Vietnamese, having penetrated the artillery positions and briefly forcing the defenders to abandon one of their guns, were forced back after heavy fighting. Coral came under attack for a second time at 2.15 am on 16 May when an estimated three battalions of North Vietnamese infantry assaulted the base, which was defended by armoured personnel carriers of A Squadron, 3rd Cavalry Regiment, as well as 1RAR's infantry. Fighting lasted several hours before the attackers were forced to withdraw. Further attacks on Coral followed on 22 May and again on 26 and 28 May, but the base was not seriously threatened again. Having had the opportunity to establish a strong, defensive perimeter, the Australians were able to launch their own attacks against the North Vietnamese, and did so on 26 May with infantry and tanks, destroying a North Vietnamese bunker system that had been discovered in the vicinity. The Australians continued to launch aggressive patrols from Coral, engaging in combat against the North Vietnamese forces and experiencing some fierce actions until the end of May.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  I second the motion. I thank the member for Herbert for that fantastic speech. She has the great honour, as she has just articulated, of being in Townsville, where the 1st and 3rd battalions are both homed. It would have been fantastic to be part of those 50th anniversary commemorations. The battles of fire support bases Coral and Balmoral during the Vietnam War were a very big deal, and it's fitting that this year, being their 50th anniversary, we look back to when those two battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment and attachments were deployed forward as the 1st Australian Task Force to just north of Bien Hoa city. In May and June 1968 there were a series of incredibly fierce and costly battles that claimed the lives of 26 Anzacs, with up to 100 wounded, and an estimated 300 North Vietnamese combatants killed during that period of fighting. There's a long list of the attachments to the battalions as part of the task force, and I acknowledge everyone who was there as part of those battles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 13 May 2018, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs announced that the Governor-General, himself a former commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, was awarding the unit citation for gallantry to the 1st Australian Task Force forward group and everyone associated in that battle. That announcement has been long awaited and much anticipated. In fact, on 13 May, the 50th anniversary of the commencement of fighting, which was also Mother's Day here, that the commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment during the battle, Brigadier Jeffery James 'JJ' Shelton DSO, MC, passed away while watching the ceremony from his hospital bed. Jim Shelton had been unwell for some time, but he closed his eyes and passed away peacefully, knowing that his old battalion had been recognised for its gallantry in that battle. It is extraordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brigadier Shelton was the commanding officer, but battles are fought by soldiers, and one of Jim's soldiers was Brian Cleaver, a nasho who had been reinforced to the 3rd Battalion. On 26 May, 20-year-old Brian Cleaver, just living his life in Australia, got caught up in the ballot, as my father did, and headed over to Vietnam to serve his country. At the Battle of Coral-Balmoral, this young 20-year-old Australian was in the thick of it. He described the battle as numbing. It was either kill or be killed. The fighting was so intense that the machine-gun barrels ran red-hot through the night and the Aussie diggers were forced to urinate on the machine guns to cool them down because they were under such fierce attack. When the smoke cleared in the dawn light, in front of Brian Cleaver's pit and with him and around him four of his mates lay dead, and 42 North Vietnamese soldiers lay dead in front of their pits. These young Vietnamese men were bulldozed into a mass grave in a large bomb crater. Brian Cleaver, all this time later, suffering from post-traumatic stress from his experience as a young man in Vietnam, went back to try and find those men buried in that mass grave, because he knew that the strong tradition of the Vietnamese is to find the remains and bring them home to be buried properly. So I just want to acknowledge Brian and his work, which has been captured by the award-winning Australian filmmaker David Bradbury. I want to acknowledge all those who serve our country, and I hope that we as a parliament can recommit to always making sure that we support our veterans. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to talk on the motion that I have put to the House, which is an important motion for my electorate of Swan and Tangney and many other areas—I see the member for Burt here—and indeed the many communities in Perth that are affected by aircraft noise. I wish to advise on further clarifications on this motion to bring it to the attention of the House. One is that the WA Labor government has recently granted Indigenous heritage approval. Two is that this new runway, known as the third runway or parallel runway, will be located at the extreme eastern end of the Perth Airport estate, parallel to the current main runway which runs north-south. Three, Perth Airport released its draft master development plan for the new runway on 31 May 2018, and public comments close on 24 August 2018. Four, the plan includes a draft airspace management plan and proposed flight corridors and the impacts of these on the community in terms of runway usage and aircraft noise. Five, Perth Airport must take into account all the submissions received and advise the federal Minister for Infrastructure and Transport on how it proposes to address any issues raised during the consultation process. Any changes will require final approval by CASA to ensure that they meet safety requirements. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perth Airport, as part of the consultation process, has already written to 300,000 residents, briefed local government and is doing a number of community expos and shopping centre visits. My constituents can attend a community expo on Wednesday and Thursday this week at the Canning Exhibition Centre and Showgrounds between 3.30 and 7.30 pm, and there is another one in Rivervale on 4 July. They have also created a dedicated web page and have opened their Airport Experience Centre with out-of-hours access for workers who can't get in between 9.00 am and 5.00 pm. They have also advertised in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> and the community newspapers and on social media. So I would strongly encourage my constituents in Swan and the wider Perth metropolitan population to get onboard and have your say in the process. You can go to www.newrunway.com.au, which provides directions on how to make a submission. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion recognises that there is a history of Labor not doing anything for the people of Perth on airport noise. I would like to use this opportunity to jog the memory of those opposite. I'm glad the member for Grayndler is here. He is long known as a champion of fighting aircraft noise, particularly in his own electorate when it came to Sydney Airport. The previous, Labor government, with the member for Grayndler responsible as the minister for transport, had many opportunities for consultation with the people of Perth for reviews on aircraft noise. In 2008, the then minister signed off on flight path changes for Perth under the Western Australia Route Review Project. These changes were made without adequate community consultation and caused great concern in the community, about which I've spoken many times, and I know the former minister is acutely aware of the complaints about the lack of consultation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The review process was handled so poorly that a Senate inquiry was conducted which confirmed the poor consultation by Airservices Australia. But, having let down the people of WA in signing off on the flight path changes in Perth, the Labor government failed the local people again by not listening to the report's recommendations. Of the 10 recommendations by the Senate committee, the then Minister for Infrastructure and Transport only accepted three. Labor failed to support reasonable recommendations such as reviewing noise levels with a view to offering a noise amelioration scheme; compensating residents affected by aircraft noise, consistent with other Australian capital city airports; and the recommendations of the WARRP of flight paths under the EPBC Act. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2012, we tried to rectify this from another angle, with a private member's bill. Along with my former colleague Judi Moylan, the then member for Pearce, we put forward the Air Services (Aircraft Noise) Amendment Bill 2011 to try and improve Airservices Australia's consultation processes and to reopen the planning process for Perth's flight paths. The proposed legislation was well received, with support indicated from the coalition, the Greens and many of the Independents at the time. But again our endeavours were thwarted. The bill was lost by one vote, 68 to 67, with Rob Oakeshott supporting the Labor government at the time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this, I'm pleased to see that Airservices Australia are actively engaging with the community and have two staff attending each of the community expos in my electorate. I note the member for Grayndler is next to speak on this motion, so I invite him to explain today to the people of the Swan electorate, and Perth, why he was so adamant about stopping the private member's bill that was put forward.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  I'm pleased to have to opportunity to address the issues raised by the member for Swan, who clearly doesn't understand the way that aviation legislation works in this country. The first part of the motion before the parliament is:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… <span style="background-color:#FFFFFF;">notes the recent decision of the Western Australia Government to grant approval for a third runway at Perth Airport …</span></span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's actually the federal government that is responsible for approving airport related activities under Commonwealth legislation—both the Airports Act 1996, as amended, and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The member for Swan is part of the federal government, and he's trying to walk away from the responsibility it has for legislation and its impact. The decision as to whether the new runway is built rests entirely with the Commonwealth government. Before Perth Airport can proceed with any significant development on what is Commonwealth land—it's Commonwealth land—it must first prepare a major development plan and submit it to the Commonwealth Minister for Infrastructure and Transport for approval. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perth Airport released an MDP for the proposed new runway on 31 May, for 60 business days of public comment. The consultation process will close on 24 August. Subject to actual demand and airline commercial agreements, the runway is likely to open at some point between 2023 and 2028, after four years of construction. As required by the reforms put in place by the former Labor government, the MDP contains a draft airspace management plan which shows indicative flight paths. Before the aviation white paper and our amendments, this didn't even occur. The final design of the flight paths will be consistent with the approved major development plan. The work will be finalised by Airservices in the three years leading up to the opening of the runway. What then happens, as a result of our legislation, is that every five years there's a review of every airport's flight paths and environmental impact, with community consultation, including the community consultation groups that were established by legislation introduced by me as the minister. That's why those processes have taken place—just like the noise amelioration plans under legislation of the Howard government, which have defined categories for either acquisition or noise insulation, that are applied to every airport around the country. So there's automatic insulation for homes, once a certain noise level is given, and there's acquisition of homes once a noise level is given.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly understand there's a need to balance the needs of the aviation sector with the rights of local communities that live around our airports. Airports are not islands, and that's why we had the national aviation white paper, the first ever. Of the 34 recommendations, many of them went to improving community consultation and the oversight of airport developments. The former government had brickworks and all sorts of activities going on at Perth Airport, rather than prioritising aviation activity at the airport that is so important for the Perth economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reforms we put in place was to prohibit developments incompatible with aviation use on federal airport sites unless exceptional circumstances exist. We obligated federal airports to submit more detailed master plans. We introduced the major development plan trigger that will be activated by any development with a significant community impact, regardless of size or cost. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Previously, when I became the minister, I remember going to Melbourne Airport and they had a whole new operation opening that hadn't been through any consultation process because they managed to break it up into smaller projects so it didn't meet the trigger. What we did was ensure that community consultation will take place just like we ensured that we established the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman and outlawed older, noisier aircraft flying to major Australian airports. Chapter 2 aircraft had continued to fly willy-nilly over residential communities before we took action.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265931" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MORTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  Aircraft noise is an important issue for my local community, just like it is for my neighbour the member for Swan and his community. Our residents share similar concerns about the impact of aircraft noise, particularly noise later at night and early in the morning. This is an important motion, and the member for Swan is absolutely correct. The approval of a third runway at Perth Airport is the opportunity to review flight paths in Perth that includes fair and constructive consultation with our community. This consultation should, of course, include communities currently impacted by aircraft noise, but it must also be with the wider community. Fair sharing of aircraft noise is a necessary solution as air travel for work and holidays increases, and one thing that we must acknowledge is that aircraft noise is part of 21st century living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With federal and state approvals now in place, proper flight path planning for the third runway can commence, which should include a review of all flight activity in Perth and the impact of noise on our communities. Perth Airport is a critical piece of WA's economic infrastructure, and that's why I don't support a curfew on Perth Airport. I've ensured that my position was made clear on this point and that it was public prior to my election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aircraft noise and the planning around metropolitan airports and their flight paths are complex issues, but that doesn't prevent us from fairly sharing and reducing noise. As technology increases, especially in navigation equipment, planes are now flying much more closely to a more consistent track, rather than spread across a path. This creates a concentration of the noise. As technology improves even more, there can be options of having multiple tracks used at different times of the day to reduce the concentration and frequency of noise in particular locations. It's about sharing the noise, and this is something I'm very keen to investigate further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been working with Airservices Australia and the federal minister for transport to investigate the installation of a permanent noise monitor located at Shelley Reserve to cover those planes that travel over Shelley, Riverton, Rossmoyne and Applecross in my electorate, and over the suburb of Salter Point in the member for Swan's electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The City of Canning supports the insulation of the monitor in Shelley. It's important that Airservices Australia has the best data possible when they consider the impacts of aircraft noise in our community. Airservices Australia's <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of the Perth Airport Environmental Monitoring Units</span> said that a permanent EMU 2 could potentially be relocated to optimise the Noise and Flight Path Monitoring System.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To improve overall system coverage, EMU 2 could be relocated west of its current location to cover a larger portion of residential receivers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recommended zone for the relocation of this noise monitor centres around my electorate and the suburb of Shelley. Shelley, particularly, is impacted by a high concentration of jet departures off the main runway and noise from approximately 25 per cent of total departures. EMU locations have been unchanged since the system was established in 1994; however, flight paths have changed significantly. By having a permanent noise monitor base at Shelley Foreshore, we'll be able to better understand and record the impact of noise in my local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all hope for a lift in the WA economy, and we're seeing signs of that occurring now. Like our mining sector, we should always use this lull to make sure the next upswing is managed better. I'm encouraging Perth Airport to consider differential pricing that incentivises airlines to more daytime flights and fewer flights in the middle of the night and very early morning. Differential pricing can also be applied to noisier aircraft, just like in other airports around the world, encouraging airlines to use quieter aircraft.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll continue to work with my community, Airservices Australia and the minister on aircraft noise in my community. I want to thank the Shelley Noise Action Group for their professional advocacy on this issue in my local area. It's a decade since flight paths were altered in Western Australia, and a review is well overdue—a review that will properly plan for the third runway at Perth Airport, a review that will make sure the impact of aircraft noise in suburbs like Shelley, Riverton, Rossmoyne and Applecross in my electorate is properly understood and the proper actions are taken to make sure we can fairly share and reduce aircraft noise.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the year, I brought together the mayors and CEOs of the nine local governments across my electorate for the Indi local government round table. They told me they face serious challenges when it comes to financial sustainability. They have small, dispersed populations and large geographic areas with significant environmental stewardship responsibilities and large asset bases, resulting in high costs and limited capacity to raise revenue. While rates are a significant revenue source for most, they can vary right across Victoria, depending on local government areas. For example, the rates payable on an $800,000 property range from $962 in Stonnington in the city to $4,201 in Towong Shire. As a percentage of median household income, the difference is outstanding—from one per cent in the City of Stonnington to 10 per cent in Towong. Rate capping in Victoria has added another strain to these local governments.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Victorian parliament's inquiry into the sustainability and operational challenges of Victoria's rural and regional councils tells us that for municipalities such as Melbourne, Yarra and Port Phillip, the FAGs, the Financial Assistance Grants Scheme allocation, can amount to less than 1.5 per cent of their total revenue. This is not the case in rural and regional councils. The three-year freeze that the Commonwealth imposed on the FAGs between 2014 and 2017 put enormous pressure on local governments in my electorate. The Municipal Association of Victoria estimates that, in one year alone, $5 million has been lost to the electorate of Indi as a result of this freeze. For Towong Shire, the immediate reality was a cut in services. They are a responsible council, so Towong reduced their swimming pool's summer season and saved $6,000. The casual road-maintenance work was reduced, saving $75,000. They ceased mobile library services, saving $50,000. They ceased funding a staff position with the Towong Alliance partnership, saving $23,000, and they reduced the opening hours of the Corryong council office and library, saving $3,000. These are real impacts on real people in real communities. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While that was important and seen as a one-off, in the long term there's a real impact on the role of government in our communities. Local governments in my electorate tell me it's absolutely unsustainable. Murrindindi Shire Council stated that, after taking service reviews, they found that they have no capacity to undertake new initiatives, strategies or policy work other than fulfilling their statutory obligations. The Benalla Rural City Council indicated that it had significantly targeted management positions for reduction so that it could keep doing service delivery. Mansfield Shire Council says:</span>

He heard about these concerns in Wodonga. He knows they're real. Local government in rural and regional Australia is not looking for a handout, but cost shifting lands on their shoulders and has a direct impact on my constituents. It's not good enough. We need, and I absolutely call for, a review of funding for local government, particularly rural and regional local government, so that they can continue to play their rightful role in our communities and deliver for all of us, as I think is the key plank of our democracy.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  It's a fantastic opportunity to be able to rise and talk on this issue in relation to local government funding. It is certainly an area that's very dear to me, because I spent a large part of my political career in the state parliament, building relationships with local governments right around Victoria. As Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development to the Minister for Regional Development, I had the opportunity to meet every regional local government in Victoria. There are 48 of them which are clearly defined as being outside the metropolitan zones. They were eligible for the $500 million Regional Growth Fund that we had going in Victoria. They were also eligible for a $160 million program for building better roads and bridges in the regions. Immediately upon coming to government, the state Labor Party scrapped that $160 million Country Roads and Bridges Program. It was a program that gave all of the councils the opportunity to spend in the vicinity of $4 million each on their roads and bridges, which would normally be a cost that would fall back on them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no doubt that regional councils have been struggling recently. The greatest indication here, and the evidence that we heard when we took the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation on the road, was the impact of the state Labor government in Victoria introducing a cap on rates. That measure was put in place to stop the enormous councils in Melbourne who had hundreds and hundreds of employees spending tens and hundreds of millions on payrolls, which were getting bigger. That was an idea to try to stop their spending, with that spending flowing over to a continual increase in rates. In order to stop these large, monolithic councils in Melbourne, all of a sudden, a one-size-fits-all blanket funding cap for regional councils was put in place. It affected every regional council, who no longer had the ability to deliver the services that were needed. I'm a little bit disappointed that the member for Indi didn't include that in her contribution, although I did come into the chamber part way through her speech. She may very well have listed the impacts of rate capping on the ability of regional councils to deliver the services that they need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the biggest issue that we have. Although we did put a freeze on increases, we have been able to keep funding programs such as the Roads to Recovery Program, possibly the most popular funding program for all regional councils because they have control over where that money goes. We also have the Bridges Renewal Program, the Building Better Regions Fund, the Regional Growth Fund, and a Stronger Communities Program. The electorate of Murray has been very strongly supported through these projects. There are also the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages, which my area of Hume was very well supported by. That has enabled the Moira shire to get a $2½ million grant for a tourism project at Yarrawonga which is going to see 2½ kilometres of walking space around Lake Mulwala. That will be an amazing project that will enable tourism to go ahead in the big area around the lake. Other funding programs that have gone through include tourism projects. The Shepparton council will have a major truck museum funded by the federal government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government introduced this freeze on increases in its assistance grants solely to bring the budget under control. We have done that. Now the small percentage of funding that goes to local government from the federal government is going to be increased. Over $800 million will flow into local governments in the very near future. It's a sensible way to go about funding local governments. As I say, the major portion of funding is derived from the states.</span>

Before I had the honour of representing the people of Werriwa in this parliament, I served the people of Liverpool as a councillor for almost eight years. During my years as a councillor, one of the major issues my council faced was the demand to deliver more services with an ever-decreasing revenue base. My council was not alone, and in conversations I've had with mayors, councillors and staff of local government recently, I'm assured this has still not changed. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that this week Canberra is hosting the Australian Local Government Association's 2018 National General Assembly of Local Government. There is no doubt that local councils have a responsibility to extract every last bit of value from their rates and charges, provide services to their communities and still manage their budgets responsibly. However, sound fiscal management by local government has been put under increasing strain by both state and federal governments through cost shifting, faux reform and a freeze on the indexation of the federal assistance grants. The impact of the indexation freeze in the 2014 budget has meant that local councils have missed out on close to $1 billion in funding. When grant income declines councils have no choice but to fill that revenue gap with either increased rates and charges or a reduction in services, less footpaths, less bus shelters and less time for people to enjoy local pools.</span>

                  </a>  For the 2017-18 financial year, Dungog, with 602 kilometres of road, received only $880,000 worth of funding. If you compare this with the City of Sydney, which has 301 kilometres of road, it received just over $1.25 million. And Liverpool, in my electorate, has in excess of 900 kilometres of road and received $2.1 million. You can see that there are challenges with the way that these things are looked at.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In New South Wales, the local government sector has faced the additional challenge of a state Liberal government who, to put it kindly, have been antagonistic towards local government. This is a state government that has forcefully merged councils against the wishes of their residents, stripped away decision-making powers of councillors and overridden local development controls to let developers run wild under the guise of reform. With the implementation of the state Liberal government's Fit for The Future faux reform program, New South Wales councils are also subject to a series of ratios and measures. These ratios are an attempt to measure a council's ability to generate revenue, provide value for money and adequately maintain infrastructure while adhering to a debt service ratio. Any council that fails to meet these ratios is faced with the threat of dismissal. Despite being democratically elected representatives of their communities, councils can be sacked for not meeting a narrow ideologically driven set of numbers imposed in Macquarie Street.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a saying that all politics is local. However, the state and federal liberal governments appear to have taken this as a licence to abrogate their responsibility and recklessly cost-shift to local government. The peak body for councils in my state, Local Government NSW, estimates that cost shifting by state and federal governments is costing local councils upwards of $800 million a year. Some of the more egregious examples of cost shifting include shortfalls in cost recovery on regulation undertaken by councils on behalf of state government and various emergency services levies, and the list just goes on and on. What we have here is a perfect storm—an increased expenditure burden through cost shifting, a reduced revenue base through freezing grants plus the additional burden of Fit for the Future ratios. Local governments all over Australia now face a lose-lose situation where costs are shifted onto them by other levels of government, meaning their residents are completely left in the cold.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to members of the government and the assistant minister for the opportunity to speak a little bit this afternoon about the 2018 budget, handed down about a month ago in this building. I think one of the defining features of the budget was that, for the first time in four prime ministers and four treasurers, we had the global economy making a big positive contribution to the budget, rather than a big negative contribution to the budget—something that we had, unfortunately, become accustomed to for much of the last decade or so. It really was welcome news that, with the global economy in such good condition, the best condition for a decade, we are seeing some of the revenue return to the budget. Obviously, it's a good thing that we have those conditions improving around the world, and that is helping the Australian economy and the Australian budget as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the economic sense, we're seeing those global conditions feeding some good national accounts outcomes when it comes to investment and exports, in particular, which made a big positive contribution to the most national accounts. You can see the transmission from a stronger global economy, where we've got something like 120 different countries growing simultaneously for the first time in a long time, making a contribution to our export numbers and some of our other, broader numbers and measures of GDP as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, despite those relatively welcome headline figures—in particular the GDP in that last quarter—there are some troubling undercurrents. Here, we're thinking about wages at historic lows; we're thinking about living standards being quite weak in historical terms; and we're thinking, of course, about low household consumption—soft household consumption—in those most recent numbers, as well as a lack of saving, and high household debt. So at the household level, below that headline rate of GDP, we've really got some quite soft conditions. We've got a lot of families experiencing a triple whammy of spending less, saving less, but still racking up more debt, and that's obviously a very troubling situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget we also had something like $40 billion of additional revenue—taxes and charges—show up at the front door of the Treasury. There's $40 billion in this budget, yet we still have record net debt in this budget, twice what this government inherited. It went from $175 billion in September 2013 to $350 billion now. We've got record gross debt. Gross debt has only been over half a trillion dollars under one government in the history of the country—under this government. In these budget papers it's expected to be over half a trillion dollars every year for the next 10 years, and higher at the end of that decade than it is today. So despite the global economy helping the budget, $40 billion in extra revenue showing up at the door, we still have a budget in substantially worse condition than it was in September 2013. Probably most remarkably, despite this substantial new revenue showing up at the door, we've got a 2019-20 surplus which relies exclusively, entirely, more than entirely, on the bring-forward of a tobacco tax. We have a skinny surplus which relies on a timing change in tobacco tax, without which there would be no surplus in 2019-20. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are just the facts of the matter. No doubt we'll get into a bit of back-and-forth here, but I'm just establishing that the facts of the budget are good global conditions, soft conditions at the household level in the economy. We still have record net and gross debt. Debt is being accumulated per month at a faster clip now, on average, under this government than under the previous government. So despite having everything that you would ask from the global economy helping the economy, helping the budget, we still have very poor fiscal outcomes in the budget. With net debt doubled, with gross debt more than half a trillion dollars and with debt accumulating faster now than it did under the previous Labor government, what we really need to hear from the government representatives here today is, why we don't hear anything anymore about a budget emergency?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FLINT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  I have several questions for the minister today regarding our investment in defence infrastructure and capability and what this means for jobs in my home state of South Australia and the nation more broadly. I'm keen to ask questions of the minister because investing in defence infrastructure and capability is one of the many ways the Turnbull government is creating a strong economy and supporting jobs in my home state of South Australia and in my electorate of Boothby. Our investments are also creating education and training opportunities which our university sector in SA, for example, is very excited about. Just last Thursday I heard direct from Professor Colin Stirling, the Vice-Chancellor of Flinders University, which is in the heart of my electorate of Boothby, of the range of benefits the naval shipbuilding program will deliver to my local area. These exciting opportunities are a direct result of the Turnbull government's investment in defence infrastructure and capability. The Turnbull government's shipbuilding plan will give Australian businesses opportunities to take part in delivering defence contracts and transfer the knowledge, technology and skills they develop into other areas of the economy. This will assist in the expansion of businesses into new markets, allowing them to competitively pursue lucrative export opportunities. Through our initial investment we will be enabling local businesses to build their capabilities and practices so they can compete globally and build our defence export capability. With nine future frigates, 12 submarines and also offshore patrol vessels, the defence industry will soon be booming. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This $90 billion investment in our nation's defence and defence industry will benefit all Australians. It will create a total of 2,800 jobs in my home state of South Australia alone and opportunities for local businesses in my electorate of Boothby—businesses like Cornell Design and Plasteel in Melrose Park and SAGE Automation at Tonsley have previously worked on major defence contracts. They know the value of defence projects to local businesses and manufacturers and the jobs they support. It's not just the direct defence work that supports jobs; it is also the technology, learning and innovation these companies can then apply to other problems or issues in the private sector and the civilian world that deliver additional value to our economy and additional jobs as well. This is to my mind the true value of defence work. It is not just the actual defence capability, which is absolutely necessary for the nation, but the skills and the technology that companies can then apply to non-defence projects. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our investment in defence could not be more different to that of the Labor Party. The former Labor government failed to commission a single vessel from an Australian shipyard during their time in office. This impacted the stability of shipbuilding jobs, particularly in my home state of South Australia, as well as the capability of our Navy and Defence Force personnel. In stark contrast, the Turnbull government has committed to building 54 new naval vessels in total. We've taken action to ensure workers at the Australian Submarine Corporation remain employed and have opportunities to upskill, with scholarships available to support roles in operations, management, computer aided design, engineering and supply chain fields. We've launched the Naval Shipbuilding College, the Centre for Defence Industry Capability and the Defence Innovation Hub—based in Adelaide—so that South Australia has the workforce and capabilities it needs to support the thousands of direct and indirect jobs that will be created by the naval shipbuilding program.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March 2017, the Turnbull government established Australian Naval Infrastructure Pty Ltd to facilitate the development and construction of new infrastructure at the Osborne shipbuilding facility, as outlined in the naval shipbuilding plan. In August we saw the first sod turned for the new surface shipbuilding yard, which is arguably the most significant infrastructure supporting the delivery of a continuous naval shipbuilding program in Australia. When completed, thanks to the Turnbull government, we will have one of the most modern and busiest platform shipbuilding businesses in the world at Osborne south. At Osborne north we will have one of the most modern and busiest submarine businesses in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The work at the Osborne shipyard commissioned by our government with the current infrastructure build, and later with the construction, sustainment and maintenance of naval vessels, is a game changer for South Australia. So I ask, will the minister update the chamber as to how the works are progressing at Australian Naval Infrastructure's new naval shipyard development at Osborne? Minister, how many jobs do you expect to be created as a result of the shipyard construction through the managing contractor? And, Minister, how has the coalition government's investment in Osborne and elsewhere helped to ensure the ongoing stability of Australia's domestic shipbuilding industry?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  I want to raise an issue and pose a few questions to the minister, which I think warrant serious consideration and response, regarding the government's so-called innovative financing—I think they call it 'innovative financing' themselves—colloquially known as off-budget investments, which in the worst case scenario is becoming an $80 billion ticking fiscal time bomb for the nation. I say at the outset I do understand there's no formal accounting definition of 'off budget', but entities or investments outside the general government sector as presented in the budget papers are commonly referred to as being off budget because they get excluded from the calculation of the government's budget deficit or surplus. The kinds of things this covers, Minister, are by way of equity investments, concessional loans, contingent liabilities, guarantees and so on. Of course, assets acquired or funded through equity investments must generate a commercial rate of return, cover their cost of borrowing and a bit more and repay their capital investment in a reasonable time frame. There are of course legitimate ways to use this kind of financing. For example, the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal under the previous Labor government or the government's decision around the Western Sydney Airport strike me as quite legitimate uses of off-budget funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are serious risks. If things do go wrong they pose a fiscal time bomb in that if the equity investment doesn't get the commercial return which is projected or if something happens to impair the valuation—or indeed if the government of the day is cooking the books—then at some point that loss comes straight back to the budget, blows out the deficit and, if sizable, can impact our AAA credit rating and blow out net debt. There is a worrying temptation for any government to overstate the benefits or inflate asset values, and the problem then becomes one for future governments and taxpayers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's critical that taxpayers, through the parliament, are absolutely confident that the government isn't cheating or fiddling the books at any point in time. I believe, having looked at the budget papers, there are worrying signs. The growth has been remarkable. Over the last five budgets, there is now a total of $84 billion of easily identifiable off-budget investments. There is about $55 billion worth of equity investments and about $29 billion of concessional loans. It's a little unclear how you count WestConnex—the government still can't tell us where that tunnel is actually going in Sydney, but that's a minor detail: just keep digging and it will pop up somewhere; give it a few billion. I do acknowledge you can identify most of the investments sitting underneath that total, but the budget documents don't provide sufficient detail for anyone to assess how much of the commitments have been drawn down across the portfolio of investments. The government has flagged in the budget papers explicitly and in all the pre-budget waffle—we hear in question time from the Prime Minister in question about this mythical $75 billion pipeline of infrastructure and the rail lines he can build with no money that he keeps announcing—that it's preparing to use these methods more extensively. So I would ask you, Minister, can you outline precisely for the $84 billion: which projects, what are the risks, where can we find this information and how much of these commitments for each instrument are drawn down and will be drawn down? And where is this information publicly available? The reason I'd also say alarm bells are ringing is—I will give a couple of examples. With the Inland Rail project, the government's now put in nearly $9 billion of funny money. You can only describe it as that because former Deputy Prime Minister Anderson's review found that it would not repay its capital, even in 50 years. This is a serious issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear what you're doing, Minister, with this set of budget documents and this investment. You're borrowing $9 billion for an Inland Rail project. You're pretending that it's going to make a commercial return above the cost of borrowing and repay its capital in a reasonable time frame. That's what is required. And yet your own independent review by the former Deputy Prime Minister, National Party doyen, John Anderson, said, 'That's not going to happen. That won't be repay it, even in 50 years.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former CEO of the Australian Rail Track Corporation told the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit—I was stunned that he actually admitted it; it was an outbreak of honesty. I noticed he's not there anymore. I don't know what went on there—he probably just retired. But the revenues that flow to ARTC won't cover the full capital cost and provide a return. So that's the CEO of the ARTC saying, 'This $9 billion we've just hidden over there isn't actually going to be repaid. It doesn't provide a commercial cost of return.' On the face of it, if that was true, you'd say, 'You're fiddling the books.' So can you explain to the parliament, then, how this is classified as an equity investment—you can build infrastructure with grants, give somebody some money and build it; that's the traditional way—and what the consequences are if some is written off, and what impact that will have on the deficit?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="241067" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Finance</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  I thank the members for Rankin and Boothby and the other member for their comments and questions. In relation to the member for Boothby's question, she raised a very important issue. What she did highlight, with great specificity, was the sad failure of the previous government to support the building of even one naval vessel during six years in office. So after six years—it's a long time—there's not one ship. Those opposite stand condemned for their failure to invest in the Australian shipbuilding industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Rankin held a very important and prestigious role as chief of staff to the then Treasurer. He did not use that lofty perch from where he sat to argue for the commissioning of a single naval vessel, and that's a failure. But, in contrast, I can explain to the member for Boothby that this government is very committed to the future of the naval shipbuilding industry in Australia. We have avoided the valley of death that those opposite so cruelly would have imposed on the naval shipbuilding industry, and we are investing very significantly in the shipbuilding industry in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in this budget, we provided an additional equity injection to Australian naval infrastructure to enable the development of the required infrastructure at the Osborne precinct in Adelaide—$535 million, a substantial sum towards the surface shipbuilding yard in Osborne. It will support the purchase of additional land at Osborne, and I'm sure that all members would support this very important investment. It's required for the Future Submarine construction yard, of course, and, thanks to this investment, the redevelopment of the Osborne yard is in full swing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only eight months after Australian Naval Infrastructure engaged Lendlease as the managing contractor for the redevelopment project, the development is progressing well. That's good news for the industry, and that's good news for South Australia. Let me go into that in a little bit more detail. It's estimated that this Osborne South redevelopment will create up to 600 jobs. Currently, there are about 100 construction staff working onsite—good news for Adelaide—and ANI advise that this will peak at up to 400 employees in 2019. That doesn't include all of the knock-on benefits to all of the related industries adjacent to the Osborne shipyard. The earthworks subcontractor, McMahon Services Australia, completed the site preparation works in April this year. The majority Indigenous-owned subcontractor Intract Australia formed a joint venture with McMahon to construct these early earthworks. We are seeing 100 per cent of the square-section structural steel for this project ordered from Australian steelmakers BlueScope, in Port Kembla, and Liberty OneSteel, in Whyalla. Again, it is all about supporting Australian industry and supporting Australian jobs and it is another reason why 2017 was the greatest year of job creation in Australian history, with some 415,000 jobs created in that year, a very strong record. This important naval shipbuilding program is a key part of that. In contrast, those opposite failed to build a single ship or, indeed, to even commission or contemplate the building of a single ship in that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to address the member's question in relation to equity financing. As he's pointed out, those opposite made use of these funding mechanisms for programs like the Moorebank intermodal, a very important project in Western Sydney, and the NBN. Each of these projects, in addition to all the projects that are accounted for in this way, is subject to a rigorous process through the Department of Finance. The principles in relation to equity accounting have been consistent over the years. That process hasn't changed. This process enables investment in important job-creating projects.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  I quite like the member for Banks. We did a bit of work together before he got elevated to deputy chief Treasury Muppet or whatever. But that's not an answer. I actually used my serious voice. I used numbers. I pointed to real facts and figures that are in the budget papers. And you completely didn't address the question. You responded to the member for Boothby's government waffle, when she wasn't even interested enough to stay around and hear your response. I feel slighted. I feel a little upset by this. So let me continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Inland Rail—and I would welcome your answer to a pretty specific and clear question, Minister—what is the basis on which you can classify this $9 billion of 'funny money' as an off-budget investment? What is the basis? Tell us how that accords with your accounting rules, which require you to make a commercial return and repay the cost of capital in a reasonable time frame. That would be a good question to answer. If you could answer that, that would actually be helpful and make this part of the legislative process perhaps just a little bit meaningful for all of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I draw your attention to another and very significant off-budget investment, if you like—the National Broadband Network. That was started by Labor—and I thank you for your acknowledgement of that, Minister—as a good nation-building project. Of course, it was based on a set of assumptions—it was based on a business case at the time—that have now changed. The Prime Minister, when he was communications minister, bastardised, as we know, Labor's visionary NBN. I challenge him to come to Glen Waverley in my electorate and have a chat to anyone there who keeps getting stupid letters from the NBN saying, 'The rollout's off,' 'The rollout's on,' 'The rollout's off,' 'The rollout's on.' The only thing worse than not getting the NBN is getting the NBN, as it turns out for people who do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN is currently valued at replacement value on the books, but industry experts are saying louder and louder that the NBN is not worth what the government claims, with the changing business model. If that's true, then the loss in value at some point will come back to budget and blow out the deficit. We're not talking about small numbers here. We're talking about $29.5 billion now of equity that the government has tipped in and another $19.5 billion of loans. Minister, can you explain the basis of the valuation and can you state unequivocally to the parliament, hand on heart—pinkie promise, invisible ink, swear in blood, whatever you like, whatever's your thing—that the NBN is worth what you claim it is, that the cost of capital will be repaid and that this is not a fiscal time bomb for future governments or taxpayers to bear? It would be very good if we could hear that unequivocal assurance that the NBN is worth what you say it is and that your reputation will hang on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point I would make is about the $75 billion sham package for infrastructure. I said to the Parliamentary Library: 'We hear about this $75 billion. What's the list of projects?' The Parliamentary Library said they couldn't find the full list of projects—and they're pretty good at finding stuff; they're much cleverer than me. I don't have a PhD, of course, unlike my learned friend, here—he's pretty good at finding stuff. But the Parliamentary Library can find no full list of the projects. In fact, when you look at the budget papers, Minister, there's only $24.3 billion of this mythical $75 billion in the forward estimates—real money. The rest is not budgeted. It appears it will be a mysterious, opaque mix of things, including contingent liabilities, like the East West Link in Melbourne—a joke—so we think you're counting that in the $75 billion. There would also be concessional loans, such as for the WestConnex tunnel in Sydney, the road to nowhere; the Auditor-General has identified a lot of problems with how that's gone. It would also include indemnities, guarantees, equity investments. There is the Melbourne rail link—the rail line the Prime Minister thinks you can build with no actual money, because apparently it's going to make a profit. I think it would be the only rail line in the world, outside Hong Kong or Singapore, that you could make a profit on building. There's a form of magic going on. As the chief executive of Infrastructure Partnerships Australia said, you can't finance your way out of a funding problem. It doesn't matter how much you cook the books or spin it, you can't. On the airport rail scam, the Grattan Institute said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So there’s a real risk that these equity investments will end up not even making a positive rate of return, never mind a commercial rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So can the minister please tell me where I can get a full list of exactly what is in this $75 billion package. I want a full list—I think the Australian people deserve a list—project by project, outlining how they're funded, what the mix of innovative financing mechanisms is, and what the finance department's advice and scrutiny has been, project by project, of the fiscal risks posed by these mythical investments.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZIMMERMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  I wanted to start by welcoming the members of the Inter-Parliamentary Study Program who have joined us for this riveting session this afternoon. I have to say it's that time of the day when the circadian cycle means that you may be feeling a bit drowsy and wanting a nap, but nothing in the Federation Chamber will ever disrupt that natural course of events, I'm afraid to tell you. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to ask the assistant minister about payment growths in the federal budget, but I want to put a bit of context around the question I pose to him. Like many members of this House, in the lead-up to the budget, we get a number of competing demands from our communities about what their expectations of the budget are, and I have to say that my electorate is no different to what the common trend is in that regard. Over the last six months, during the course of my work in the electorate, I have met many people who have spoken to me about their concerns for essential services and those important items of infrastructure which they expect government to deliver, and I know that those concerns have included funding for education and health care and what we're going to do to support the transport needs of a growing city like Sydney. Therefore, I think this budget has met a lot of the expectations that those residents have posed to me. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly highlight the incredible commitment that we're giving to school education, with an extra $23½ billion over the next decade; the commitment to health which is reflected in the $30 billion extra that will flow to our public hospital system; all that we're doing to support drugs becoming cheaply available to those who need them through the PBS and the like; and of course what we're doing in the area of infrastructure. Unlike the member for Bruce, I'm delighted that we actually have a 10-year plan for infrastructure, which was reflected in the pipeline that was released in the lead-up to the budget by the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the Deputy Prime Minister. Having that type of 10-year funding pipeline is just so important for projects which obviously run over multiple years. It allows those developing the projects to plan properly and accordingly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commitment to that type of infrastructure is reflected in my own electorate, where I'm really pleased that this government has been able to deliver funds for important infrastructure projects like creating a major new public foreshore park on the former submarine base <span style="font-style:italic;">Platypus</span>, in Neutral Bay, which opened a couple of weeks ago for the first time. We provided $20 million to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust for that, and it followed the $50 million that Defence spent on remediating the site. Similarly, we're investing almost $10 million in new sporting facilities at Gore Hill, which is a commitment to the sport and recreation needs of my community. I also know that, in relation to transport, through the Asset Recycling Initiative, we're continuing to provide something like $1.6 billion to help the New South Wales government build the Sydney Metro project, which is really great news. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other area that my constituents raised with me is the need for tax relief. That's why I think this budget is so important, because not only are we delivering the company tax reductions that small and medium-size businesses so desperately need, company tax reductions which will maintain our international competitiveness, but also that personal income tax package which offers relief in the short term to low- and middle-income earners and in the long term will guarantee that 94 per cent of Australian taxpayers aren't paying any more than 32.5 per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area that people do raise with me is obviously the issue of government debt and how the government is going in relation to coming back into surplus. What is pleasing about the budget, of course, is the commitment to bring the budget back into surplus a year earlier, to reduce debt by $30 billion over the current four years and to constrain the debt blowout that was created by the last Labor government when it went on its reckless spending program. That's a great achievement of this government. In part we've been able to do that because revenues are increasing, but I'm conscious of the fact that the success of the government's fiscal strategy has not just been about relying on revenue; it's also been about relying on spending restraint. Therefore I wanted to ask the assistant minister whether he might be able to provide the House with an update on how we're going in our efforts to balance the budget by reining in spending and making sure it's sustainable, and particularly how that compares with the efforts of previous governments.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  It's getting harder and harder not to laugh when you hear those opposite talk about debt under Labor, when in fact the government's own budget papers, these budget papers which were released by the government in May this year, show there in black and white that net debt has doubled during the five years of those opposite. It has actually doubled. Gross debt is also at record levels and debt is accumulating at a faster rate now under this mob than it did under its Labor predecessors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Leaving that aside, I want to pick up on something else that the member for North Sydney said in his contribution, if you could call it that. He talked about what the people in his community wanted to see in the budget. He talked about education spending. I think he should write to the members of his electorate and say that in this budget this government pulled another $270 million out of TAFE. I think that says it all about their approach to education. If we genuinely care about teaching and training our people for the next generation, for the jobs of the future, we can't continue to hollow out TAFE as this government has been doing. It is a new $270 million cut to TAFE in this budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's one thing that shows how spectacularly out of touch they are when it comes to communities around Australia. Another one is when it comes to wages. One of the defining features of the economy in the last few years has been that we have had wages growth which is at historic lows. They are really quite poor wage outcomes, despite the fact that the economy has started growing and global conditions are terrific. We have all these sorts of things going for us. There's been a decoupling between the prospects of the national economy and the prospects of ordinary workers like those that the member for Moreton and I represent in the best part of Australia to the south of Brisbane. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a story there from the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, in a quite remarkable contribution, which I congratulate him on. In the last week or two he gave a speech about wages. What he said about wages was that unfortunately in this country we've come to expect that what used to be normal wages growth of maybe three or four per cent has become more like two per cent. The new normal for wages growth, for a whole range of reasons relating to technology, bargaining power in the workforce and all of those sorts of things—what we're seeing is wages growth stuck at two per cent, which is a really poor outcome. That's why we're seeing less consumption, less saving and more debt, because people aren't getting the wages outcome they need and deserve to look after their families in suburbs of this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So when you examine the budget in any detail, something that really jumps out at you, a big red flashing light in the forecast that the government is relying on, is that it has got remarkably optimistic—many of the independent commentators have said overly optimistic—expectations for wages growth. Remember, as I said before, and as the Governor of the Reserve Bank and others have said, we've had wages growth of around two per cent. It's been under two per cent, which is shocking. It's now around two per cent, or just over. Remember that the Reserve Bank governor said that that might be the new normal. Yet when you look at the budget—even at the summary table in statement 1—and if you look at their forecast for wages, the wage price index forecast is at two per cent now. By the end of the coming financial year they're expecting it to be 2¾ per cent—a pretty big jump. Then, in 2019-20, they expect it to jump to 3¼ per cent. The projections after that are 3½ per cent for 2020-21 and 2021-22. What that really tells us is that with wages growth at two per cent, all of a sudden, the government is expecting that, miraculously, we're going to get to 3½ per cent wages growth in just a few years time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the assistant minister would know, and as anyone who follows budgets would know, budgets are very sensitive to little tweaks in the forecasts, and what we've got here is really quite a substantial forecast change in wages. I've done my best not to make this a partisan question, because I think it's an important thing for us to understand when we look at the budget, even in an objective way. What I'd like to know from the assistant minister is: what would be the impact on the underlying balance if the government included in its budget wage forecasts which were more realistic, more in line with what the RBA governor is describing as the new normal of two per cent?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="241067" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Finance</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  It's good to be able to respond to the questions from the member for North Sydney. I also want to pick up on some of the comments from the member for Rankin. The member for North Sydney rightly points to the importance of fiscal constraint. He asks about that because he knows that the Australian people want their government to live within its means and he knows that the Australian people expect their governments to take a prudent and cautious approach to spending the money of the people. And there is a tremendous contrast between the prudent observations of the member for North Sydney and those opposite, because, when the member for Rankin was the chief of staff to the Treasurer of Australia, the real growth in spending under the previous government was some four per cent on average per year. It was very, very high—four per cent every year. Under this government—and this really goes to the heart of the query from the member for North Sydney—the average growth in real spending has been just 1.9 per cent per year, and, when you're talking about a budget of literally hundreds of billions of dollars, that difference between four per cent on average and 1.9 per cent is immense. And the good news is that, in this budget, the forecast rate of growth of spending declines even further to 1.6 per cent, and that comes through the hard work of going through each program carefully and of thinking, when one is going to spend the people's money, that it is just that—the people's money. It's not the government's money. It is money that has been generated by the hard work and enterprise of the Australian people, and we need to be very judicious and careful in how we spend it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that government net debt is expected to peak in this financial year—the financial year that ends in less than two weeks. And we expect that net debt will be reduced by some $30 billion over the next four years. So it is very important: we are turning the corner from that appalling legacy of debt and deficit that those opposite left us. We know they haven't passed a surplus budget since 1989, and the member knows that 1989 was a very long time ago. There have been no surpluses under those opposite since that period, some 29 years ago. And so, Member for North Sydney, it is pleasing that we are in a position of turning the corner on net debt and of paying an estimated $30 billion over the forward estimates, and it is an extraordinary contrast with those opposite, because what we saw under those opposite was the requirement for more and more spending to be addressed to interest payments. Of course, when they came into office there was no net debt. There was some $16 billion of cash in the bank, and they turned that around to a net debt of close to $200 billion—a very, very poor result indeed. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to also address a number of the comments of the member for Bruce and the member for Rankin. The member for Bruce should be assured that the process in relation to equity accounting is as it has always been—the Auditor-General is required to sign off on the government's financial statements, including the treatment of any equity-accounted investments. That's as it should be. That's a very sensible and prudent approach. There are specific rules in relation to the classification of an investment as equity: it must be outside the government sector, there must be an expectation that the investment will be recovered in real terms and the government must exercise reasonable control over its investment. These are all the sorts of questions to which the Auditor-General turns their mind. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  Wages policy is such a huge priority on that side of the parliament that in a five-minute answer, the Assistant Minister for Finance said 'wages' with 17 seconds to go but then didn't say anything actually about wages. He just said 'wages', because the member for Moreton was within his rights to say, 'Don't you care at all about how people are being paid in this country?' It says it all about how out of touch those opposite are, that we can't even hear a peep about wages. In a serious non-political question about the sensitivity of the budget forecast to a more realistic forecast on wages in line with what the Governor of the RBA said, those opposite can't even bring themselves to utter a full sentence about wages in this country. I think that does say it all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the member for North Sydney and the member for Banks were out listening to their community or indeed any community, they would know one of the main reasons people aren't in a big rush to give the Treasurer a big pat on the back for the economy is that the economy that people feel—the economy that people experience—is dictated largely by whether or not they're able to work hard and provide for their families. Wages are a big part of that. It's disappointing but not especially surprising that those opposite don't realise that. It's disappointing but not especially surprising that we don't get any concession or recognition when those opposite talk about debt. They always say that debt was disastrous under the Labor Party. Net debt is literally twice as big now after five years of those opposite in government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Banks bangs on and on about how Labor didn't deliver a surplus during the global financial crisis. That's a matter of historical record. But what is also a matter of historical record is this mob under rosy global conditions—quite good global conditions—is yet to deliver a surplus. Spare us the dusted-off Tony Abbott talking points of 2013; they really should be beneath someone who walks around this place and pretends to be a serious contributor to the economic debate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that this budget is built on three dodgy elements. The forecast surplus in 2019-20, and the forecasts generally, are based on three dodgy sets of assumptions. The first one is wages, as I mentioned. The second one I dealt with very briefly in the beginning. It is that the entire 2019-20 surplus is based on assuming that we can pull forward $3.3 billion in tobacco tax revenue. I hope we can; we do want to crack down on illegal tobacco, but the people of Australia need to know there's $3.3 billion claimed there and it's only a $2.2 billion surplus. You don't need to be a genius to work out—even the member for Banks can probably work it out—that the surplus in 2019-20 is entirely reliant on that tobacco tax bring forward. The third set of dodgy assumptions—the cooking of the books in its most partisan and political form—is that the budget continues to claim billions of dollars in savings which have no chance of passing the Senate. In this place, the political commentators call them the zombie savings because they just won't die. The parliament keeps voting against them, and those opposite, just because they want to deliver a rosier set of numbers than they are entitled to do, continue to claim a whole bunch of zombie measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The worst one is the pensioner energy supplement, which has been defeated in the parliament. It takes money off seniors who need it, particularly in the winter but also in the hot summers, to pay their electricity bill. Those opposite want to take it away from them. The parliament, to its eternal credit, crossbenchers included, has continued to knock that back. Yet, in the budget, there it was again. The budget is claiming a billion dollars in savings from the energy supplement which won't pass this place, so there's a billion dollar black hole right there. Those opposite like to talk about budget black holes—there's a billion dollar hole right there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The same is true of the family tax benefits, the maximum liquid assets waiting period, the pension supplement for people overseas, the pension residency requirement and the pensioner education supplement. There's a theme emerging. These are all attacks on pensioners. They say to the pensioners of Australia, 'We can't find $14 a fortnight for your energy supplement, but we can find almost $5 billion for the Commonwealth Bank,' the biggest single beneficiary of the company tax cuts that those opposite pretend to be so proud of, which give $17 billion to the big four banks and $80 billion to big business, which will largely spray around overseas for multinationals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So my question to the assistant minister—I'm not expecting an answer given he hasn't even engaged on a simple nonpartisan thing like wages policy—is: when will the government be pulling the zombie measures out of the budget so the people of Australia can get a serious fair dinkum sense of the budget position without the government cooking the books with savings that won't pass this parliament?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="248969" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CREWTHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  I want to thank the Assistant Minister for Finance for the fantastic job that he and the finance minister are continuing to do in working to reverse the damage done to Australia's financial situation by six years of Labor. It has been a long process and a difficult balancing act. While we have a responsibility to the Australian people to support necessary services, we also have a responsibility to appropriately manage what is really the Australian people's money. It is disappointing that not all in this place have the same respect for taxpayers' money, including funds that come from my own electorate of Dunkley. We have introduced a number of budget repair measures totalling over $41 billion. So my first question to the minister is: can the minister advise the chamber on the progress of the government's budget repair measures through the parliament? How much progress has the government made in passing unlegislated budget repair measures since the 2016 PFO?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians expect us to live within our means, and we have not done this in a long time. The past few years have been spent working towards getting the budget and the underlying cash deficit back on track. We're approaching the end of the financial year, and it is widely expected that the underlying cash deficit will have been lowered to $18.2 billion. This is a huge figure; however, this is expected to be the best budget outcome since the Howard government's last budget a decade ago. The size of government debt is not to be underestimated or dismissed; however, my constituents and I are delighted that progress is being made. My second question to the minister is: what is the estimated impact of measures that the government has implemented since the 2013 election, and can the minister please speak to some of the key measures that have contributed to this figure?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot continue to borrow money to fund services that should be funded by the government as a matter of routine. That is why we are delivering a surplus in 2019-20, the first since we came to government in 2013—over a six-year period we have worked to undo six years of Labor—and the first since the last year of the Howard government in 2007, just before Labor came into government and brought the difficult financial circumstances they left for us in 2013. Compare our results to those opposite. I was five years old when Labor last delivered a surplus in government. The Berlin Wall was still standing. It was a difficult situation at the time around the world, but it was even more difficult being led by Labor, who have not delivered a surplus since that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is our job to ensure that essential services like health and education can be funded through strong economic management and not by using borrowed money, so we can reduce our deficit to bring us back into a surplus and, therefore, reduce our debt. That means we're reducing our interest payments, and we will have more to spend on health and education. We cannot continue to borrow money forever. This is why it is crucial that we make sure that our spending is sustainable. This is exactly what the government's approach towards funding services has been. We have now reached the point where we no longer have to borrow to pay for routine government expenses, which was a situation Labor brought us to after the 2007 election, when you continued to put us into deficit, therefore increasing debt and therefore increasing the interest on our credit card payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, we have responsible economic management. That, unfortunately, is not something that could be guaranteed if those opposite were again in government. The strong economic management of the Howard era was torn to shreds by the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. Had their spending not been reined in, Australia would have been at risk of losing its AAA credit rating from the major ratings agencies. The Treasurer, the assistant minister, the Minister for Finance and our government, led by the Prime Minister, have been responsible in managing the economy to ensure that we continue to retain that AAA credit rating. Even now, those opposite will try to write off the coalition government's successes since 2013, promising bigger, better tax cuts while pledging funding increases for every potential recipient that they can think of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, I am concerned that the only foreseeable way that Labor could do so would be to plunge us back into further debt, undoing all the hard work of the coalition and recklessly putting us back into a vulnerable position should we find ourselves facing the global difficulties of just over a decade ago. Considering what I have said, could the minister please also tell us more about the budget repair measures presented by the coalition and how these will get Australia back on track? Finally, can the minister outline the government's fiscal strategy and how the government is planning to achieve a sustainable budget position over the medium term?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="37998" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  It's hard to imagine a less intelligent, less informed contribution to this otherwise important conversation about the budget. You can come in here with your opinions. You can't just make it up as you go along. The only reason we have a AAA credit rating from all three agencies is that it was won, for the first time, under the same government that the previous speaker was criticising. Can someone please, before he speaks, check his notes for him or write some notes for him? That was embarrassing. We have three AAAs because they were won under the government that he was criticising. Surely you can at least check a fact as basic as that. Or maybe, before you talk about interest repayments, check the fact that they are higher now than under any other government. If you want to talk about debt, maybe at least be a little bit ashamed of the fact that net debt has doubled and that gross debt is over half a trillion dollars, and both measures have accumulated faster under this government than under the Labor predecessor. It is so tempting to go through all of the ways that that was really just an appalling, fact-free contribution to what should be a conversation based on facts—really quite disappointing, unbelievable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will move on to other matters, given the lateness of the hour. One of the noticeable features of changes in government spending in the last little while has been the quite extraordinary increase in spending on contractors. If you go to the government's AusTender website, you can run a whole bunch of searches to show that, since the government changed hands in 2013, a lot of the categories have just exploded in terms of spending—billions and billions of dollars in extra spending on a lot of things that used to be done by the Public Service. The reason that we have that is that an arbitrary cap has been placed on public servants, in this town and right around Australia. Federal public servants have had an arbitrary cap imposed. That says to agencies: 'If you want to get this work done, you need to get it done externally.' There will always be a role for external expert advice, but we shouldn't be wasting billions of dollars in marked-up work—labour hire, contractors, consultants—when that work could and should be done by the Public Service. I think one of the things that sticks in the public's craw is that they get lectured all the time—'We couldn't possibly find that money for the pensioner energy supplement; we couldn't find that $270 million for TAFE'—but we can spend billions and billions more every year on contractors and consultants in the Public Service because there is an ideological commitment to a Public Service cap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what's happening in Australia on the government's side is that we're paying more and more for poorer outcomes. We're paying more than we were before, and we're getting inferior outcomes. That's because those opposite cling to this ideological Public Service cap, which is not actually delivering the policy outcome that they want. The purpose of the Public Service cap was to keep down costs in the Public Service. Instead we have costs blowing out madly. Anyone who spends even 10 minutes on the AusTender site can see the quite remarkable multiples of growth in certain categories, particularly of management services in the Public Service. Agencies need to get the work done but they've got the cap, so they have to go outside. So we're seeing all of this public money wasted on what is an IPA ideological frolic, which is the cap on the APS headcount.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was put to the finance minister, Senator Cormann. Over the summer there were a number of well-informed stories in our broadsheet press, which had done what the public expects it to do, which is to examine the spending by the government on contractors and consultants, and uncover this extraordinary blowout that the government would rather Australians didn't know about. The government's response, quite remarkably, was to say you can't rely on those figures. They're the government's figures on the AusTender site. What we need, very clearly, is more transparency and more accuracy. If those numbers are wrong then other numbers need to be provided, because this scandalous waste of billions, if not tens of billions, of dollars to satisfy this ideological obsession is a matter of public interest. My question to the minister is: why have you made it not transparent enough for the Australian people to understand just how much money you're wasting on consultants and contractors?</span>

He again hits on the important point about restraining government spending. It's a very important contrast with those opposite. I will talk to the member's question about some specific savings measures that have been passed through the parliament in recent times, but we also need to understand the alternative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One way of improving the budget position is to make savings. That is the better way. That is the preferable way. Those opposite are all about tax increases. They propose more than $200 billion of tax increases. The member for Rankin wanted to talk about older Australians in his contribution. He and his colleagues are proposing to smash older Australians with a massive retiree tax that will devastate hundreds of thousands of older Australians. Those opposite also want to smash the housing market by abolishing negative gearing for all except new homes. In an environment where the housing markets around Australia are already under pressure, that is going to lead to tremendous problems, and it's going to hit the most important asset of the vast majority of Australian households, their home. It is an appalling policy. They also want to put up capital gains tax by 50 per cent on everything, not just on housing and not just on investment property. They voted against tax relief for any business that has a turnover of just $2 million, which is a very, very small business. Those opposite said, 'No, this is some sort of big business, and it is not entitled to any form of relief.'</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are bad policies. They are in contrast to the priorities of this government and of the member for Dunkley. He knows that getting the budget back on track is about sensible budget repair. He knows that since MYEFO we've implemented and delivered savings worth some $4.6 billion. We are doing the hard work of actually passing budget repair measures. Since the 2017-18 budget there has been some $16 billion worth of budget repair measures. Since the 2016 Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the value of budget repair measures implemented by this government has been some $41 billion. That is a massive improvement in the fiscal position of this nation, and that is why in this financial year we turn the corner on net debt and begin paying down that legacy of debt, with some $30 billion of net debt reduction expected over the forward estimates. That is being driven by the strong results of this government.</span>

In relation to the forecast on wages and other matters, here are some comments. Saul Eslake says that the economic growth forecasts in the budget are reasonable and the commodity price assumptions are conservative. Stephen Koukoulas, not known as a raving fan of the government, says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to note, in this context, that the budget is framed on a series of realistic and reasonably conservative economic forecasts for economic growth, wages and company profits …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a very sensible contribution by Mr Koukoulas. This sort of assertion from those opposite is just wrong. We note that in an environment where we are constraining government spending growth to just 1.9 per cent in real terms, that means that public-sector spending is under control. That is the right thing for this nation.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms JULIE BISHOP</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  The 2018-19 budget is designed to ensure Australia is well positioned to achieve the objectives set out in the <span style="font-style:italic;">2017 Foreign Policy white paper</span>. This is the first comprehensive review of Australia's international engagement in 14 years. It sets out our priorities and interests, underpinned by values, and reaffirms the government's commitment to delivering more global opportunities for Australian businesses. As my friend and colleague the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment knows, Australian business has to be internationally competitive. The budget includes a $15 million business engagement package to continue tackling non-tariff barriers faced by Australian exporters and to increase the competitiveness of our service exports in particular. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government is pursuing the most ambitious trade agenda in Australia's history, having concluded or upgraded seven trade agreements since we were elected in 2013, including the historic Trans-Pacific Partnership 11. This morning Minister Ciobo launched formal free trade agreement negotiations with the European Union. We are pursuing these job-creating deals because we know they drive economic growth, they open doors for Australian businesses in growing markets around the world and they create jobs. Our thriving tourism industry is supporting 600,000 jobs. In fact, under the Turnbull government 16 times as many tourism jobs have been created as under the previous Labor government. The Turnbull government is continuing to provide record funding for Tourism Australia, and is supporting $45 million in grants through the Building Better Regions Fund to help move even more tourists into our regional areas. The budget will also fund work to identify solutions to grow our cruise sector, which contributes $2.7 billion to the economy each year, and to create many jobs through our creative industries through the $140 million Location Incentive Funding Program. We're very excited about this because it's going to encourage more international productions to film in Australia, underpinning our creative sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget also further delivers on the government's largest diplomatic expansion in over 40 years and the white paper's commitment to open more overseas missions over the next 10 years. We are providing $10.8 million for a new consulate-general in Kolkata, India—that brings to four the number of diplomatic missions in India—and $8.4 million to open a high commission in Tuvalu. The new consulate-general in India will help Australian businesses access opportunities in India's growing mining sector. We're also protecting our interests in the ever-changing Indo-Pacific region. Tuvalu is a key member of the Pacific Islands Forum and an important partner in the Pacific, and this will bring to 14 the number of missions that we have in the Pacific. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're stepping up our efforts to create a more resilient and prosperous region, and the Pacific will benefit from over $1.3 billion in aid in 2018-19. This is Australia's largest-ever contribution to the Pacific, and it represents over a quarter of Australia's total aid program. It includes funding for undersea telecommunications cables for Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, and this is all about delivering more reliable communications infrastructure and providing economic development benefits for our partners in the Pacific.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll also invest an estimated $4.2 billion in total eligible official development assistance in 2018-19, including $410 million for humanitarian funding and, in this increasingly dynamic and volatile world, we need to have funding to help those in need after a crisis. The aid budget is responsible, it's affordable, it's targeted and it's delivering sustainable outcomes in health, education and gender equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also providing $10 million over three years for the new Australian Aid: Friendship Grants scheme—I think this will be welcomed by all sides of the parliament—which will enable Australian community groups like service clubs, diaspora groups and civil society entities that are not currently registered with DFAT to deliver aid in conjunction with funding from the Australian government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the white paper also seeks to promote and protect the international rules based order, and I'll just mention one area where this is of concern: the Turnbull government continues to seek justice for the victims of the downing of Malaysia Airlines MH17. We're providing $50.3 million over four years to support the Dutch prosecution of those responsible and assist the next of kin to participate in court proceedings. The coalition government will continue to advance Australia's security and prosperity in a highly competitive world.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  I rise to contribute to the consideration in detail debate for the budget, particularly with regard to tourism, because there is no doubt that this budget is a missed opportunity when it comes to tourism with the coalition failing to restore the $35 million funding cut from Tourism Australia last year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Investing in Tourism Australia is a no-brainer. The fact is that every dollar spent on tourism advertising and marketing generates a return on investment of some $16. What's more, we know that tourism has been identified as one of five supergrowth sectors by Deloitte. It employs more than one million Australians and, given where we're located—in the fastest growing region of the world—there is enormous opportunity for us to grow the economy and grow jobs, particularly in our regions, if the government provides appropriate support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Upon coming to office, the coalition cut two of federal Labor's successful programs: the T-QUAL Grants Program and the Tourism Industry Regional Development Fund. Both of those programs supported industry development by providing grants for projects that would not only attract both interstate and international visitors but also encourage them to lengthen their stays. Communities across the nation benefited immensely from these programs. While the tourism sector is performing well in Australia, the fact is a number of challenges remain around regional dispersal and extending the average stay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The continued success of tourism relies on a government that supports it, and the coalition should prove it does by restoring funding to Tourism Australia. It's not just Labor saying this; the TTF, the peak organisation, said, 'It's dismissed as a joke by Minister Ciobo'—and I note that his attitude towards the sector is now on the record. They describe the 2018 budget as bittersweet saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the Government has missed a golden opportunity to reap the benefits from substantially increasing its funding for Tourism Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This follows the disastrous 2017 budget, which saw not just the cuts to Tourism Australia but the increase in visa application charges. Of course who can forget the minister's performance in question time speaking about any increase in the Passenger Movement Charge as 'killing the goose that lays the golden egg'?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He made a goose of himself, because immediately after that the government introduced a budget that in fact increased the passenger movement charge, in spite of the fact that there was very clearly an election commitment from both sides of politics that that would not happen. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we know that tourism does matter. When the government were elected in 2013, they forgot to appoint a tourism minister; so they have improved somewhat—they at least have someone as tourism minister now. We know that tourism generates more than $97 billion in economic activity. It's got to be regarded that investment in tourism is just that—it's an investment that produces a return; it's not simply a cost. We know that there are enormous opportunities. At the last election, we were the only political party that produced a tourism policy. When we're in government, we certainly won't forget to appoint a tourism minister; indeed, we will make sure that tourism is very much linked in with infrastructure and transport. We know that all the great cities of the world that rely on tourism—New York, Paris, London—have very effective public transport networks, and we know that that linkage with provision of infrastructure is so important. We know also that tourism infrastructure matters in our regions. There is incredible opportunity for us to grow tourism in the regions around Australia, not just at the Reef and the Rock. More importantly, there is an opportunity to grow jobs in regional centres. So we regard tourism as a priority and we regard this budget as a lost opportunity. Indeed, the feedback from the sector is that it is a lost opportunity. Tourism is critical to Australia's future, and it's about time the government gave it due support. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AN0" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CIOBO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  Well, there you go—that's the full commitment of the shadow tourism minister. He comes in, rambles for five minutes, making all sorts of false allegations, and walks back out. That is the summation of Labor's approach to tourism. When it comes to the Australian tourism industry, the Australian Labor Party is nothing other than a complete and utter fraud. This guy opposite, the shadow tourism minister, gets up, rattles off a few platitudes and then not only walks out he has next to nil investment in Australia's tourism industry. This is from the Australian Labor Party, who just took five minutes lecturing the coalition about tourism funding, yet when they were in government they actually cut funding to Tourism Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the shadow minister makes the false allegation that there's been a $35 million cut to Tourism Australia's funding, he fails to mention two things. The first is that that reduction in TA funding was a consequence of the operation of the Department of Finance's foreign exchange financing of the tourism agency. That's what that was: Department of Finance foreign exchange fluctuations. That's what drove that reduction. But what we know now and what the actual facts are now is that Tourism Australia is receiving record funding under the coalition. When Labor was elected, the federal coalition had left Tourism Australia with a substantial amount of funding. In the 2007-08 budget, there was $136.3 million. What did Labor do in 2013-14? Funding was down to $130.4 million. So, when the shadow tourism minister walks into this chamber and starts rattling on about reductions in Tourism Australia funding, well, Labor would know, because Labor delivered reductions in funding for Tourism Australia. That is in complete and total contrast to the coalition, which has increased funding for Tourism Australia to record amounts. When there was a change in the forward estimates, it was as a consequence of the Department of Finance's foreign exchange dealings. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing to note about Australia's tourism industry is we have a record number of tourists staying for a record length of time and spending a record amount of money. Lo and behold, there has been record funding from the coalition. So there are four records for Australia's tourism industry: record numbers, record spend, record length of stay and record funding from the coalition. So I frankly reject entirely this fraud of a shadow tourism minister when he comes in here and starts telling the coalition how we're getting tourism policy wrong, because the fact is that the results tell a very different story to what we're hearing from the shadow tourism minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other example that we saw was when he tried to verbal me in relation to TTF. What I did was question the authenticity of the shadow tourism minister, which he tried to manipulate and twist into somehow being a criticism of the industry. Do you know what? I have been proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with Australia's tourism industry for decades with operators on the Gold Coast, operators in regional markets like Cairns and operators in our major cities, all of them driving this magnificent industry from strength to strength, notwithstanding that, for the two terms that they were in, the Australian Labor Party slashed Tourism Australia's funding, massively increased the passenger movement charge and levied a host of new taxes on Australia's tourism industry. It was the men and women of Australia's tourism industry—including my very own family—that continued to make sure that Australia went from strength to strength.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm so pleased that the foreign minister and I work hand in glove in promoting Australia globally. Take, for example, the bold new campaign in the North American market. It's a terrific campaign, which is, in fact, up for a number of awards at the forthcoming global television advertising industry awards in Cannes—a testament to the bold vision of the MD of Tourism Australia, John O'Sullivan, and of the board of Tourism Australia and to the fact that the foreign minister and I can work together as a team to maximise the opportunity for Tourism Australia to continue to put its best foot forward. We will remain invested in giving the tools that Australia's tourism industry needs to make sure they go from strength to strength, to continue to provide record exports, to continue to see record numbers of tourists, to continue to see record spending in the tourism industry, and to continue to drive investment in the tourism industry so that we can, most fundamentally, continue to create so many jobs for those hardworking men and women and the next generation of young Aussies coming through.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:17</span>):  I want to ask the trade minister about non-tariff barriers. The foreign minister mentioned in her introductory remarks the allocation in this budget to tackle non-tariff barriers, and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Foreign </span><span style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">olicy </span><span style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span style="font-style:italic;">hite </span><span style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">aper </span>released in November last year made the point that the government will implement new non-tariff measures to respond to business concerns. As the minister knows, this is a big problem and a serious problem. It's arguably the biggest problem confronting a lot of Australian exporters and potential exporters. As tariffs have gone down around the world over the last few decades, a lot of non-tariff barriers have gone up, and I think the minister made the point in his remarks at the Press Club two weeks ago that G20 countries have implemented more than 7,400 non-tariff measures in the last 10 years. In the budget, as I mentioned, there's funding allocated in the DFAT portfolio. There's also funding allocated in the department of agriculture's portfolio. That's for ag councillors, I understand, to be posted to the UK, Mexico, Japan, India, Chile and Russia, but not China, which I thought was interesting. But I didn't want to press that point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was interested in learning more today, if we can, about the DFAT allocation of $15 million over four years for a package of initiatives to support the Australian business community. In estimates, a couple of weeks ago, we were advised that $6.6 million of that $15 million would be allocated towards tackling these non-tariff barriers. Can the minister provide us with some more details on what that funding will be allocated to do and, specifically, whether this is the funding allocated to tackle that issue identified in the white paper or whether there are other things that the minister is intending to do here? And, while the minister's on his feet and thinking about this, I'm interested in the minister's views on a proposal by the former National government in New Zealand to establish a cross-agency team of their equivalent of DFAT and agriculture to coordinate the work that government does on non-tariff barriers in key export markets. It's something that I understand the new Labour government in New Zealand has continued with, so that, now, there's a single point of information and contact for exporters when dealing with government, whether they're dealing with an ag issue or some other issue, that can address their concerns and help to make sure there's better coordination when industry needs the support of government. So my first question is: what does the minister think of this as potentially a way to tackle this big and important problem?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I've got the chance, I might ask also the minister for his thoughts on the value of internship programs for young Australian professionals and how they might be inserted into trade agreements. The minister would be aware that the French government recently negotiated an agreement with the Chinese government—a reciprocal program that allows young professionals to gain commercial experience in China, undertaking an internship for I think up to six months. In their submission to the foreign policy white paper, the Australian Chamber of Commerce Shanghai, who met with both the minister and me today, recommended that such a program should be replicated for young Australian professionals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an idea that wasn't picked up in the white paper, but it's an idea that I think is a good one. Not enough Australians have experience working in Asia. I'm conscious—and I'm sure the foreign minister will make this point—that the New Colombo Plan facilitates that. This is something that could operate over and above that. Knowing as we do, from work that Asialink and PwC have done over the last 12 months, that we have a serious deficit in terms of the number of Australian professionals with experience working in Asia, I wonder whether there's some thought being given to trying to implement a similar program to this to make sure that the next generation of Australian businesspeople have these sorts of skills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've said that, if my party wins the next election, we'd seek to establish a similar program to the one that the French have recently negotiated with the Chinese. If it works, it's the sort of thing that I think we could do with other countries in Asia. So my question to the minister is: does he support this approach of increasing the amount of Asian business skills that young Australian professionals have by setting up internship programs with our Asian neighbours?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  While I'm glad to hear the member for Blaxland ask some questions quite rationally, as opposed to the member for Grayndler, I've spoken previously in this chamber about the New Colombo Plan, and, as somebody who was a student in Asia learning a language and as somebody whose background as a practitioner was predominantly doing trade deals, living and working in Asia, with the foreign minister's focus on economic diplomacy before taking on this role that she now fills, the delivery of the New Colombo Plan is being received so well, not just here in Australia but indeed particularly across the Asia-Pacific. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was disappointed in the member for Grayndler's very emotional beat-up against the government, again unnecessarily. If I go back to the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd era, I was then based in Asia and I was doing deals, and I had my head in spreadsheets. When you're doing very large deals, often there is a cell on a spreadsheet for sovereign risk, and that usually impacts a discounted cash flow, in one way or another. At that time, Australia's sovereign risk was far higher than it was previously and certainly far higher than it is now, and that is because the Australian economy was being managed so poorly by the previous Labor administrations, which had a detrimental impact on investment coming into Australia but also on Australia's reputation internationally. If there has been something in particular that this Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and his predecessor has done so well, it is executing those free trade agreements. Indeed, the Korea, Japan and China agreements all stalled under the previous Labor government. We saw the impact ultimately residing in the state of the national economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at our national economy now. Our national accounts came out only a couple of weeks ago. What we see is unemployment at 5.4 per cent. What we see in the first quarter of 2018 is a growth rate of one per cent, making annual growth 3.1 per cent. Business confidence is up and investment is up. This is an extraordinary set of figures for Australia's national economy. When you break down that last quarter of growth, the No. 1 one thing that drove Australia's growth for the first quarter, the biggest contribution to our GDP growth, was exports. We saw even in the last financial year $374 billion in exports. Now that is a record for our country. In Queensland alone: Queensland's total exports of goods were valued at $70 billion in 2017—that's an increase of 25 per cent. Of course, the biggest export good for us in Queensland is coal, followed by beef. There are nearly 25,000 people employed in the coal industry in Queensland and nearly 20,000 in beef—both enormous producers of jobs and growth to our economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking at the track record of this government, as somebody who has worked in trade most of his life, I cannot tell you how proud I am to be part of a government that has concluded seven FTAs, and to think of the FTAs that have impacted us, particularly in Queensland, such as the Japan, Korea and China FTAs and, more recently, Peru and the TPP-11—a negotiation, by the way, that the Leader of the Opposition thought we should fold on—all being delivered by this coalition government. That is what, ultimately, is opening up opportunities for us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Negotiations are now to start with the European Union. This is a marketplace of half a billion consumers. This is a marketplace with a US$17.3 trillion GDP economy. Again we see opportunities opening up, because we have the single most comprehensive, ambitious trade agenda that this country has ever seen—which leads me, of course, to ask a question of our Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. Could the minister expand on how the Turnbull government is delivering on our ambitious trade agenda? And how will that agenda continue to drive opportunities here in Australia, particularly opportunities that will drive growth?</span>

This year's budget delivers the weakest levels of Australian development assistance in history, now spending just 22c in every $100 of our national income on foreign aid in 2018-19. On the current trajectory, by the end of the forward estimates this will be just 19c in every $100. The aid budget has now been cut in every single budget since this government came to power. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a deep interest in contributing to global poverty alleviation, and our international development program supports security and stability in our region. The minister's own DFAT white paper that was released late last year said that Australia's overseas aid program aims to:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… assist developing countries reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development in line with Australia's national interest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, in London a few months ago, the Minister for International Development, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, cited opinion polls to justify Australia's poor aid budget. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia we had some research done where it showed that about 80 per cent of Australians believe that we should not be spending more on foreign aid or that what we spend is about right.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it seems that the government thinks an opinion poll is the best way to determine how much we should spend on overseas development assistance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the Turnbull government, the New Zealand government gets it. They've described their decision to boost aid funding in this year's budget as a clear demonstration to the international community that New Zealand is serious about addressing global and regional challenges, and their decision to lift overseas development assistance to 0.28 per cent of gross national income over the next four years is a demonstration of that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A Shorten Labor government will contribute more to international development assistance than this current government. We've repeatedly urged the Turnbull government to return to a proper bipartisan approach to international development assistance, so I was heartened to hear the foreign minister last week say that she believes that foreign development assistance should absolutely be increased. My question to the minister is: at a time when Australia's influence in the region is under stress and you yourself believe that we should be spending more, why haven't you been able to prevent $11 billion worth of aid cuts in the Australian budget? </span>

The unprecedented growth in the Indo-Pacific region will provide job-creating opportunities for my electorate of Forrest, particularly while Australia's economy, one managed by the Turnbull government, remains resilient, competitive and agile. I am a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which is planning a delegation to India and Indonesia to meet Australian businesspeople in both countries to discuss the challenges they face in day-to-day operations, the scale of opportunities both markets provide, and the obstacles to expanded trade such as language, cultural traditions and infrastructure. The delegation will also meet with committee counterparts in the respective parliaments. Can the foreign minister outline how a new consulate-general in Kolkata, India, will further help businesses in Forrest access opportunities in India's growing economy and advance our interests in a changing Indo-Pacific? </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to supporting small to medium businesses in Forrest, the coalition government is creating a new generation of outward-looking young Australians with an abiding interest in our region through its flagship foreign policy initiative, the New Colombo Plan. I'm delighted that former Busselton Senior High School student and 2018 New Colombo Plan scholarship recipient, Ms Hayley Winchcombe, was earlier this year named the inaugural New Colombo Plan ASEAN Fellow at a special reception with the leaders of the 10 ASEAN countries, co-hosted by the foreign minister and the Prime Minister. How does this type of educational exchange help guide Australia through a period of profound change in our region, boost employability and drive economic growth? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since February, I've been supporting another form of educational exchange. As part of the Australia Awards Women's Leadership Initiative I've been mentoring Nirose Silas from Vanuatu. Nirose recently completed a Master of Business (Management) at Queensland University of Technology. An auditor by profession, she is returning to her native Vanuatu, where she hopes to continue to work with the Public Accounts Committee supporting the Vanuatu parliament. Nirose's future goal is to become the Auditor-General of Vanuatu. I wish her the best in this. She's absolutely committed to improving the leadership skills of women in Vanuatu and supporting them to take on senior government and public sector roles. How is the coalition government's aid and humanitarian budget supporting girls and women like Nirose in our region to reach their full economic, social and political potential? And how will this budget allow generous community organisations in Forrest to tackle poverty and inequality in our region through the government's new Australian Aid: Friendship Grants? </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in order for us to benefit from the immense opportunities in our region, Australia must be well placed to meet a diverse range of security threats—from Islamic terrorism to threats to open sea lanes which enable trade in goods and energy that fuel the region's growth. Countries continue to disrespect, challenge and undermine international law. North Korea's long-range missile and nuclear programs are one such example. We, and I in particular, remain deeply concerned by the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17. No members of my electorate were lost on that fateful day, but the grandparents of the three young Maslin children live in Dunsborough, in my electorate. This was beyond a dreadful day, and it was a tragic day in the life of that family, and every day since, for them and their whole family. Minister, how does this budget seek justice for the victims of the downing of MH17?</span>

                    </a>  Okay. This question is about beef exports to China. In March last year, the Prime Minister signed an agreement with the Chinese Premier, here in Canberra, that will increase the number of meat processors in Australia that can export chilled beef to China. It's an important agreement. The minister issued a statement at the time—I think with the former Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce—saying it was worth, potentially, about $400 million to Australian industry. Unfortunately, now, 15 months later, no additional Australian meat processors have been able to export chilled beef to China. When asked about this at estimates a couple of weeks ago, it was made clear that the agreement that was reached last year in March to expand access is still being worked on by the department. </span>

Minister, I know that the beef companies have written to you about this, and they've told you this, and they've also written to the Prime Minister, so my question is: what action is the minister taking to resolve this issue?</span>

I have met with them and I remain in contact with the Maslin family and the other families throughout Australia of the 38 people who were aboard flight MH17 from Amsterdam. The Australian government's commitment of $50 million is to assist the families of the victims to take part in the Dutch proceedings. There will be a state prosecution led by the Netherlands, and we want to ensure that the families can take part. The funding will also go to support those proceedings. The Ukraine government has entered into the necessary treaty arrangements and extradition arrangements with the Netherlands, so we believe a very full prosecution will be able to take place. But the member for Forrest would also be aware that, on 25 May, after receiving further details from the joint investigation team, Australia and the Netherlands called upon Russia to accept state responsibility for its role in the downing of MH17. We share the grief of the families around the world of the 298 people who were killed, and we'll continue to do what we can to get justice for the families here in Australia.</span>

Under this women's leadership initiative, the female recipients of Australia Awards who have studied in Australia will be mentored by an Australian businesswoman or parliamentarian, or a woman from civil society, so that they can maintain that connection through the Australia Awards alumni, but it is also about supporting women in the Pacific, who do face many challenges. </span>

First, we're providing women with the skills, the capabilities and the capacity to take leadership roles in their families; in governments, both provincial and national; in business; in communities; and in civil society. Second, we're supporting the financial empowerment, the economic empowerment, of women by giving them the necessary skills and access to microfinance, and ensuring they can join the formal labour market. Third, we're dealing with the scourge of domestic or gender based violence in the Pacific. No country is immune, but it is particularly prevalent in the Pacific. This alumni program is part of our efforts to support women in the Pacific.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You also raised the New Colombo Plan. I'm particularly proud of that, because from a standing start in 2014 to the end of this year over 30,000 young Australian undergraduates will have been overseas, pursuant to funding under the New Colombo Plan. The member for Blaxland says, 'Why don't we have an intern program?' That's precisely what the New Colombo Plan is. Australian undergraduates have the opportunity not only to live and study in one of 40 locations in the Indo-Pacific but to undertake practicums and work experience. We have had some amazing levels of cooperation from businesses and governments and civil society, who are supporting young Australians undertake these practical experiences, working experiences, as part of the New Colombo Plan.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to Kolkata, I point out that it is the centre of India's mining and resources sector. I'm pleased that the member for Forrest asked a question about her constituents. The new consulate general will enhance two-way cultural, education, research and tourism connections and provide consular opportunities, but for the member for Forrest's electorate I think the tourism and the mining opportunities will be enormous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the question of aid, the member for Blaxland asks why there isn't a bipartisan approach to increasing the aid budget. I say: why isn't there a bipartisan approach to maintaining a budget surplus and maintaining an affordable aid program? He talks about $11 million in cuts. The trajectory that Labor had embraced was utterly unaffordable and was never going to happen. The aid budget has increased—2.1 per cent per year. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AN0" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CIOBO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  Before I get to the questions from the member for Blaxland I will speak to the questions asked by the member for Fairfax and the member for Forrest. Both of them are outstanding local members, outstanding for their consistent advocacy on behalf of their constituents—in particular their small to medium sized enterprises. I had the privilege of being with the member for Fairfax and going to Yandina, where I had the chance to meet with a macadamia nut processor and farmer. I note that one of Australia's premier macadamia nut processing plants, Nutworks, is in the electorate of the member for Fairfax. It employs more than 60 people and is now exporting its products worldwide. In fact, Kylie Watson, the CEO of Nutworks, at an FTA seminar recently explained how an increase in inquiries from China, spurred as a consequence of the introduction of the FTA, prompted Nutworks to start exporting its macadamias. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It was the timing of the reduction in tariffs. We really started to see an increase in enquiries, particularly coming out of China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a consequence of the member for Fairfax's strong work and understanding of his local community and his being a strong advocate for them in the government's party room.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise, I've had the privilege of being with the member for Forrest and speaking to not only local tourism exports but small and medium sized exporters. They are the people who are creating employment in Australia and giving opportunities for new young Aussies to be able to participate in the labour force by getting jobs in the small to medium sized enterprises that are now exporting their products and services to the world. That's a direct consequence of this, the most ambitious trade agenda that Australia ever had and—as we have seen in relation to the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement—their advocacy and their level headedness with the Australian public about the opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there is good spirit shown by the shadow minister opposite, but we should never forget it was the Australian Labor Party who described the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement—they came in here asking in an anguished tone what was happening bilaterally and why wasn't the Australian government doing more—as a dud deal. This deal, which has underwritten a third of Australia's economic growth, was described by Labor as a dud deal. In fact, they turned the other way when the Australian trade union movement ran the most disgraceful, dishonest, multimillion-dollar campaign against China and Chinese workers and said the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement was going to wreak devastation across the Australian economy. So you can understand why I might take a minute to reflect on Labor's track record. Again, you don't look at what Labor say; you have to look at what Labor do. And their track record on the bilateral relationship with China on trade and on investment is absolutely disgraceful! </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time that I have remaining, I'll speak more directly on non-tariff measures; the government have put money on the table. We've put money on the table to deal with non-tariff measures in a comprehensive way, because when I talk to industry I hear concerns about non-tariff measures, in the same way as I get strong advocacy from the member for Forrest and the member for Fairfax as well as so many coalition members, who raise with me the concerns of their constituents on NTMs, or non-tariff measures. We're working to break down those barriers. Under the coalition, we've seen some of the most expeditious outcomes around protocols to get Australian goods into markets like China than by any government in Australia's history. We're also putting more money down. I'm sure the shadow minister would like to know that I'm looking very closely at what New Zealand has done in relation to opportunities for an interdepartmental committee. I don't want to use IDC loosely, but I'm looking for opportunities for coordination between the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources and the Department of Trade and Investment, and I'm happy to speak to him directly about other concerns that he has.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Denison</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:46</span>):  Australia continues to refuse to sign the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, even though over 50 nations have signed so far and close to 100 more are expected to. Australia, along with the US, has even tried to derail the treaty's progress. This is an historic treaty—one that's being led by countries without nuclear weapons and that bans the production, stockpiling, testing, possession, hosting, use and threat of such weapons. It recognises that any use of nuclear weapons would have catastrophic consequences for our planet. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we see the posturing by the leaders of the US and North Korea in recent months, it's easy to see why so many Australians care about this. That's why I was proud to sign the ICAN Parliamentary Pledge, which is a commitment of parliamentarians around the world to support the treaty and urge their governments to sign up. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia needs a more independent foreign and security policy and shouldn't keep blindly following the US. If we were more independent, we'd realise that this treaty is essential, because nuclear weapons, regardless of whose hands they're in, are a threat to everyone. The government must listen to the community and sign up to this treaty, because a complete abolition of nuclear weapons is the only option for us.</span>

I thought it didn't look like much. I went to see my GP and he too said, 'It doesn't look like much, but we might just get that checked out.' They cut it out, and I've got to say: melanoma. So a bit of a scare. Then, of course, they had to hack off a whole lot more. So can I say to our guys out there: it is worth going to get a check-up; it is worth going to get your skin checked, get your heart checked, get your cholesterol checked and, for some of the older guys, get your prostate checked. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  In this short space of time, I thought I'd mention leadership. But let me first begin by giving a few words of support for the ABC. While I don't always see issues in the same way that some ABC journalists reflect, I have a great deal of respect for the majority of their work. It absolutely demonstrates a high degree of media leadership, especially in our regions—reliable news, weather reports, local stories and material of regional interest. I would hope that political leadership matches the ABC's media leadership and dispels any idea at all regarding the privatisation of our ABC.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of leadership locally, I'd like to thank all those school leaders who came to our leadership events over the past two weeks, showing me how talented and perceptive they are about the qualities of a good leader. Thanks to the schools: Nowra Anglican College, St John the Evangelist Catholic High School, Nowra High School, Bomaderry High School, Sussex Inlet Primary School, Milton Public School, Shoalhaven Heads Public School, Minnamurra Public School, St Georges Basin Public School, Bomaderry Public School, Bomaderry High School, North Nowra Public School, St Michael's Catholic Primary School, Milton Public School, Moruya High School, Sunshine Bay Public School, Moruya Public School, Batemans Bay Public School and St Peter's Anglican College.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you, in particular, to the leaders of the high schools who genuinely want to make a difference. I look forward to working with these leaders to examine in detail how to improve homelessness, get rid of plastic bags and, especially, to stop using plastic straws. We'll develop a social media method to work up ideas and advocate for change.</span>

Jill Bilcock AC was recognised for her service to the Australian film industry. Ms Bilcock was recognised as a role model for aspiring editors and praised for her contribution to Australia's cultural identity. Neville Sillitoe OAM was recognised for his service to athletics. Mr Sillitoe has coached many successful Olympians, including Gary Holdsworth, Greg Lewis and the incredible Peter Norman. Shirley Jones-Griffin OAM was recognised for her service to the performing arts, particularly in the field of ballet. Dr Terence Ahern OAM was recognised for his service to medicine—Dr Ahern works out of a local medical office in Brunswick. Robert Gottliebsen AM was recognised for his services to print, media and education. Mr Gottliebsen is a regular contributor to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Business Spectator</span>, and has spent more than 30 years commentating on business and investment in Australia. These people join a select group of inductees to our unique Australian honour system. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Wills is a wonderfully diverse electorate. It really gives me great pleasure to know that such great people call our electorate home. These inductees represent and demonstrate excellence in our society, and they support their local communities. We're all better for their activities, their passion and their commitment to others. And, as their federal representative, I want to extend my appreciation, acknowledge their hard work and thank them for their extensive service to our electorate of Wills, our community and the nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  I rise to encourage locals in the city of Albury and nearby Jindera to attend one of two community information sessions being staged by the National Broadband Network this week. In this place, the NBN rollout is often discussed in overcharged political terms and tones. It should also be remembered that for regional Australia the arrival of the network has provided us with a far earlier chance to experience much better broadband options. As Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, and as a country MP with two major regional cities in the middle of connecting, I won't pretend the rollout hasn't had its challenges. But what I have noticed is—amid all the claims of upload and download speeds and delivery objectives—the NBN and its retail service providers becoming more aware that it is real people wanting to connect to the network. Supply and demand of the net has become such a commercial numbers game that the people who deliver the technology sometimes forget the people at the end of the line. When a business owner cannot connect, when a student can't study, when mum and dad can't Skype their family overseas, it's an issue and it needs addressing. I want to acknowledge those involved in the NBN, from management to the technicians on the ground, who already look after all these people, and to encourage others to realise that your business will be a lot better off if you do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  At this moment, around the country, including here in Parliament House, thousands of people—in excess of 10,000 at Princes Park—are attending vigils to remember the life of Eurydice Dixon, whose tragic death in Melbourne last week has shocked us all. Her rape and murder has also reignited calls for action on gender equality and respect for women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a tragic irony that I had planned to speak today about a local youth-led community group in my electorate known as GPAN, or Good People Act Now, which works to tackle gender-related and domestic violence issues. The GPAN project trains young people to become leaders amongst their peers, and equips them with the tools to challenge harmful beliefs about gender and relationships. GPAN focuses on peer-to-peer bystander action and teaches how to safely challenge sexism, stereotypes and disrespect, as they witness them. It also works to promote emotional maturity in men. This initiative is an innovative example of how young people can challenge the gender drivers of violence at a grassroots level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate GPAN on receiving $100,000 from the Victorian Labor government to fund important programs that promote gender equality and an end to violence against women, and to develop their model in a way that can be replicated in other communities. These are young people taking action. Their work has never been more important and more called upon than it is at this poignant and tragic moment. As we all grieve for the loss of this bright young woman, and search for answers, our thoughts and the thoughts of GPAN are with Eurydice's family, friends and local community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:57</span>):  I had a great experience recently, connecting a local not-for-profit organisation with a local business, all for a great cause. Makeables Tingalpa, which is part of Multicap High Needs Disability Support, is a not-for-profit disability employer. Since 1991, Makeables has provided employment, job skills and lasting working relationships for people with high-needs disability. Multicap's business manager, Joshua Walsh, recently reached out to me asking for help connecting with businesses in the area. Makeables offers fantastic services for local businesses. This includes manual assembly and finishing services such as packaging, bag sealing and labelling. This can save businesses in employment costs and warehousing space. Makeables employees also benefit from these arrangements. It gives employees life-changing skills and training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the great pleasure of meeting these employees at Makeables Tingalpa this month and seeing their work firsthand. I thank my good friend David Bateson from Wynnum Business for putting Makeables in touch with Little Images, a local childcare photography business. Owner Leigh Farley says that Makeables employees have done great work putting together a promotional mail-out for Little Images. Makeable employees folded letters and brochures for Little Images and inserted them into windowed envelopes to be sent to prospective clients. They also included a chocolate drink, so people could read over everything with a nice cup of hot chocolate. I'm glad to have helped make this arrangement possible.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>):  Morry Breen is a Central Coast builder, environmentalist, inventor, unionist, footballer and coach who last week was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for his services to our Central Coast community. Unfortunately, Morry was admitted to hospital on Sunday morning and missed his celebration at Wyong Rugby League Club, where Greg Tun, Mike Campbell, Neil Rose, Rod Wicks and others spoke of his extraordinary contribution. Morry's son Jim spoke on his behalf. Jim said that when Morry found out he had been awarded the OAM, he said, ‘I'm not a royalist, but I got this Queen thing and I'll accept the bastard for the club and all the people.' Jim said of his Dad that Morry always had the courage of his convictions. Jack Mundey agreed. Jack and Judy visited Morry in Wyong hospital today, and Jack has spoken often of Morry and their time together in the green ban movement. The most significant of these bans for the coast was the green ban the Central Coast Trades and Labour Council, under Morry's inspiring leadership, successfully imposed on the Hooker-Rex proposed residential development of Riley's Island in the 1970s. Prior to that, Morry had played a major role in preserving the red gum forest of the north Entrance Peninsula, standing up to the threats of international mining companies to preserve the bush and putting his family home on the line to do it—typical of Morry. For these efforts and many more in sport, affordable housing and the environment, we owe Morry a great debt of gratitude. Morry, we're all grateful that you arrived on the coast in 1963 to take up coaching the Wyong Roos—up the green and golds! Congratulations, Morry Breen OAM, and thank you.</span>

Dubbed 'the pod', this new centre is designed to take learning out of the traditional classroom with robotics, interactive touch-screen displays, 3D printing, writable walls, an indoor drone-flying space as well as a 360-degree imaginarium. I had the pleasure of attending the official opening recently, and after touring the centre and experiencing the imaginarium myself, I can say without a doubt that this new facility will inspire the imaginations and dreams of the next generation.</span>

To be able to immerse yourself in another world and see actual footage of the surface of Mars or explore the Australian outback from the comfort of your school introduces students to a whole new way of thinking, interacting and learning. I would like to congratulate the principal, Dr Mark Sly, on bringing future learning to Coomera Anglican College and taking students' learning literally out of this world. The parents, students and wider school community are so impressed with the pod, I have no doubt it will set an example for learning environments right across the country. Well done to everyone.</span>

Particularly, I think, I'd agree with myself even more if I could pick the people who had to do more yoga and do a little bit less talking! In fact, 21 June is the International Day of Yoga. It's the fourth annual United Nations International Day of Yoga. We've hosted, this week, people practising yoga from all over Australia. For the first time in any federal parliament, there was Indian TV there. Yoga, of course, is an ancient practice and it means to unite, to join and the bringing together of the physical, mental and spiritual components of what it means to be human. It's a gift to the world from India, and it's widely practised across Australia but also in my electorate, which is home to many thousands of migrants from India and South Asia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I confess it is a life regret of mine that, despite a few false starts, I've never managed to build or maintain a practice of yoga. I've tried. I've failed. I feel silly. So I admire people who do, not just for the exercise but for the mental clarity it brings. In 2005, I visited an ashram and stayed there in India for two weeks. I did daily yoga with one of the fittest guys. He said he stopped counting how old he was when he turned 90. He was unbelievable. I congratulate people across Australia in their wave of yoga festivals this week in my electorate and elsewhere. I also thank the Indian high commissioner for being at the parliament this morning with us.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  It is 22 July 2018 that marks the centenary of Cranbrook School. The school started with 64 boys and has grown to become one of the great educational institutions of Australia. One hundred years ago, the founders of the school sought to create an Anglican school that would produce well-rounded individuals, giving the boys a range of academic, sporting and cultural opportunities to help them fully develop their personality. I attended Cranbrook under two inspirational headmasters: Mark Bishop OBE, a distinguished scientist and one of the finest liberal educators Australia has produced; and Dr Bruce Carter AM, an outstanding leader of young men, who taught me Latin and gave me so many opportunities to develop my knowledge and leadership skills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last century, Old Cranbrookians have enriched the nation and the world. Among their number are chief justices, soldiers, entrepreneurs, sportsmen, businessmen, scientists, artists and humanitarians. The school's motto, 'esse quam videri', means 'to be rather than to seem to be', which is perhaps why I'm only the second Old Cranbrookian to serve in this place, as it's a good preparation for life but a poor preparation for politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As with any independent school, it's important to acknowledge the very great personal sacrifice of parents who choose to send their children to Cranbrook and to support the school through a wide range of other activities. I'm grateful for the education I received at Cranbrook and I will always be proud to be an Old Cranbrookian. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Headmaster Nicholas Sampson as well as the staff and students of Cranbrook. You have custodianship of an important tradition which stands for educational excellence and active citizenship. I wish you the best for your celebrations and good luck in the next century. </span>

We know that 3.5 million jobs will potentially be impacted by automation in some way. In a labour market of 12 million, that's a big deal. Getting young people ready for those changes and skilling them up is a fundamental national priority, and getting them to lift their digital skills base is hugely important. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of schools in my area within the seat of Chifley that are doing just that, working very hard to prepare young people for these changes. Last week we got to demonstrate what having a strong digital skills base and having proficiency in technology means, when Tesla visited two schools in our area to show the technology behind leading-edge electric vehicles. The first stop was Plumpton High, where we met with three outstanding students with engineering teacher Stephen Attard and head of TAS Nigel Shakespeare, Plumpton having competed in F1 in schools competitions for a number of years and doing fantastic work there. We also visited Quakers Hill Public School through the strong leadership of Principal Bert Lo Campo. Both schools are learning a great deal but also getting the next generation involved in digital skills development. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  I have some fantastic news for residents of La Trobe. After waiting and waiting and waiting, we've finally got the state Labor government to put out an expression of interest for the Monash Freeway Upgrade Stage 2. The total cost will be $711 million and the project is expected to be completed in early 2022. Stage 1 saw the construction of an extra lane from Clyde Road to South Gippsland Highway. Stage 2 will see an extra lane from South Gippsland Highway to Warragul but also going out from Clyde Road to Cardinia Road. This is taking in this huge growth corridor in suburbs such as Officer and going right out to Pakenham. This is something I've been fighting for for many years. The great news was that back in March 2016, when the Turnbull government committed $500 million—that money hasn't been spent, sadly. It should have been spent, and we should be opening stage 2 today, but instead we are putting it out for tender. Part of stage 2 is the Beaconsfield Interchange and the extension of O'Shea Road. This will greatly reduce traffic congestion on Soldiers Road and Clyde Road and will make the lives of people driving around the electorate much easier, especially parents dropping kids off at school. So it's great news today. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  Hello, boys and girls, what window should we look through today? Should we look through the round window? What about the square window? I know, let's look through the murky window of the Liberal Party, where the ABC is privatised. Do you know what 'privatisation' means? It means that the things that the people own, like the public broadcaster, are sold off by the government to greedy private interests. It means no Bananas in Pyjamas, no Big Ted, no Little Ted, no Jemima, no <span style="font-style:italic;">Playschool </span>and the programs that my children and millions of Australian children have grown up with for over 50 years. It means no public broadcaster delivering sound news and information and Australian content. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia wouldn't be the same without our ABC. It's not a world I can imagine. But the Liberal Party can. They've overseen close to $300 million in cuts and a loss of 800 jobs. Have you ever cut $282 million from important public services, boys and girls? No? Me neither. And they've done all this despite their election commitment of no cuts to the ABC. Have you ever broken a promise, boys and girls? My message to the Prime Minister and the LNP is this: it's our ABC. It belongs to all Australians. Hands off! </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to officially open the dual-lane Tone Bridge on the Cranbrook road last week. The previous bridge was a 90-year-old timber single-lane bridge and was inadequate for the traffic using the road. This upgrade will now provide safer access in and out of the Shire of Boyup Brook, particularly for the school buses, caravans and heavy haulage vehicles which regularly use the road. Vehicles will also not have to stop and give way to oncoming traffic when approaching the bridge. This was not only difficult; it was dangerous for large trucks and road trains carrying very heavy loads. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the WA government for contributing the matching funding for this project, as well as the Boyup Brook shire and shire president Graham Aird for facilitating the project. I know the new bridge will stand the test of time and last for at least another 100 years, and I congratulate the contractors, Fulton Hogan, on their work. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government contributed $2.45 million towards the $5 million project through the Bridges Renewal Program. This program provides funds to upgrade and replace bridges to improve access for local communities and allow for increased traffic movements. My electorate has benefited from over $7.5 million in funding, including in the town of Williams, where $5 million has been allocated to replace two bridges. Both bridges take Albany Highway across the Williams River running through the town, and provide a key link between Perth and the Great Southern.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:11</span>):  Just over two years ago, Jo Cox was murdered while doing her job, which is our job. This parliament came together then in solidarity with her, her family, her colleagues and all those who loved her. This solidarity should continue—it must—as Jo Cox's work continues as an enduring legacy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Jo Cox Foundation has been carrying on her values through its work in the UK, particularly on the question of loneliness. On this question, I hope that there can be bipartisan support here, as there is there, with the recognition that not all human needs are material and that we do have a responsibility as a society and as individuals to reach out to those who are isolated. Loneliness is a killer, but it need not be. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm mindful of Jo Cox's example and the work of her foundation in another respect. In her first speech, Jo Cox spoke with hope and optimism about multiculturalism. She said that we have more in common than that which divides us. Of course we do—but we can't let that go unsaid. We can all be kinder, more respectful and less cynical; and more generous, less defensive and less selfish. In this place, we have to reject the voices of division, be they overt or more insidious, such as through proposals to create, in effect, two classes of Australians. Where we are from, how we came here, what faith we practise—none of these things warrant a tear in the social compact which binds us to each other. We're all in this together.</span>

It is never easy to talk about people who take their own lives, but it is an issue we as a government must address. In this budget, the government provided an increase of $338 million in mental health funding, with a focus on suicide prevention. It is important that all of us, no matter where we are in the community, continue to focus on the prevention of suicide, in particular among people who are dislocated from our community. I thank Ryan for writing to me and submitting his speech. Hopefully, over the coming weeks, I will be able to present more speeches to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  Over the years, the Liberal Party has accepted a number of significant foreign donations, including $14,000 from Kazumasa Ikoma of Japan, $50,000 from Kin Chao Sun of Hong Kong and $1.5 million from British citizen Michael Ashcroft. For over a year, Labor has refused to take foreign donations, but the Liberal Party still remains open to taking foreign cash. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you care about foreign influence on Australian elections, if you are worried about the hacking of US voter register databases in 2016, then you should be committed to getting foreign money out of Australian politics. Bill Shorten has moved a private member's motion in order to stop foreign donations coming into Australian politics. But somehow the government has managed to morph the debate over foreign donations into another part of its attack on charities and not-for-profit organisations. Labor supports the principles outlined in the Hands Off Our Charities alliance statement. Hands Off Our Charities includes Oxfam, Save the Children, WWF and Human Rights Watch. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe we can end the corrosive influence of foreign cash in Australian politics without stymieing the important work of charities. We call on the Liberals to stop taking foreign donations, to follow Labor's lead and to pass a ban on foreign donations that doesn't hurt charities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:15</span>):  When I visit retirement villages across the coast, I'm often asked about what we're doing to guarantee essential services for older Australians, including almost 31,000 people aged over 65 in my electorate on the Central Coast. Last week, I was at Brentwood Village meeting with residents and hearing about what was important to them. We shared our plan to support older Australians, and I listened to their thoughts on the future of our nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I also had a particularly special visit to a local retirement village, where the Wood Glen Retirement Village association hosted the Prime Minister for a seniors forum. It was a wonderful event, with more than 100 guests joining us from Wood Glen as well as from neighbouring villages Tarragal Glen and Forresters Beach. It was a great chance to hear from older Australians about what matters to them and an opportunity for them to ask questions of the Prime Minister. Peter Hanson of Tarragal Glen asked a question about the cost of electricity. John Anstice asked about tax reform. We also heard from many self-funded retirees who spoke to us about Labor's retirement tax and the attack on their savings. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the members of the residents committee, Chairman Dr Tony Neaverson and Vice Chairman Dr Jim Paterson, thank you for all your hard work in putting together this event and for your thoughtful remarks, for your great questions and for the delicious morning tea. To the village manager, Vanessa Fordyce, and RetireAustralia's CEO, Alison Quinn, thank you for your hospitality. Your organisation and preparation of this event made it a wonderful morning for all concerned.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  This past weekend, there were two attempts to raise the Harbour Defence Motor Launch <span style="font-style:italic;">1321</span>. This patrol boat took Australian Z-unit special forces in behind enemy lines in World War II, and its crew conducted themselves in an exemplary way. This boat is still with us in Darwin. We've tried to get it off the beach twice in the past weekend. I want to acknowledge in particular the not-for-profit organisation Save Motor Launch 1321 and its chairperson, Robert Welfare, a solicitor in Darwin, for all his tireless work. I also acknowledge Scott De La Rue, from Freo Group, who'll be providing cranes and trucks to get a 25-tonne boat trailer down the old Catalina ramp in Darwin. Thanks very much, Scott. I also acknowledge Chris Boyer from Trafficwerx, Ronnie from Flash Tyres, the guys at NT Welding and Michael Foreman from Systems Homes. Thanks very much for your corporate social responsibility and your pro bono work on this project. We will get the <span style="font-style:italic;">Rushcutter</span> up onto the trailer in mid-July. I thank everyone who is helping with this important project to safeguard military history in the Northern Territory.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  At this time of year, over 1,100 Rotary clubs across Australia are meeting for their annual changeover dinners. It will be a time of camaraderie for members of those clubs but, more importantly, an opportunity to reflect on their achievements over the past year and to install new club presidents and executives for the year ahead. Rotary is a global movement, and here in Australia some 30,000 people are members. The organisation plays a central role in so many communities across Australia. Rotary members give selflessly to assist other community organisations or to raise funds for great causes. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most notably, Rotary has led the way in its global campaign to end the prevalence of that awful disease polio, and achievement of that goal is now in sight. As a member of Rotary for many years and a former club president, and now as an MP, I see the role of Rotary in our community time and time again. I therefore want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to those club presidents and all their executives who are completing their term in my electorate, including presidents Peggy Yu from Chatswood; Carl Heath from Chatswood International; Andrew Chew from Chatswood Sunrise; Alon Beran from Crows Nest; Roger O'Dwyer from Hunters Hill; Harry Clarsen from Lane Cove; Silvio Gmur from North Sydney; Iain Clark from my own club, North Sydney Sunrise; and Derek Matz from Northbridge. They can all be proud of their achievements and that of their clubs over the last 12 months. I know so many in the community are grateful for their support. Well done to them all.</span>

Over 150 CEOs, business and community leaders joined 50 of Australia's top chefs to cook and serve a feast for 1,300 Australians at an event that raised $2 million. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">OzHarvest was founded by the inspirational Ronni Khan in 2004. I'm so proud of the fact that I attended the launch of OzHarvest in 2004, and at that launch in Surry Hills in my electorate, I said it reminded me of the lyrics in the Paul Kelly song 'From Little Things Big Things Grow'. I was certain that OzHarvest would go from strength to strength, and indeed it has. It was the first organisation in Australia to rescue perishable excess food. Ronni has been driven by her passion to make a difference and stop good food going to waste. Starting with one van in Sydney, OzHarvest has now grown to 50 vans operating across nine Australian cities. Over 100 tonnes of food is rescued each week from over 3,000 food donors, with the food delivered directly and free of charge to over 1,000 charities. Since 2004, 83 million meals have been delivered, and 28,000 tonnes of food has been saved from landfill. I urge people to watch the film next Monday night about OzHarvest.</span>

Helen Brownlee is one proud local who has been rewarded in the recent Queen's Birthday honours. She has devoted much of her life to sport and improving female participation rates in sport and at the Olympics. Helen has participated in competitive canoeing, winning Australia's first international slalom medal. Helen was a judge at the 1972 Munich and 1988 Seoul Olympics and remained a member of the competition jury at the 1992, 1996 and 2000 Olympics. Helen is the first woman to be granted life membership of the Australian Olympic Committee as well as being the first woman elected to the Australian Olympic Committee executive team, including being vice-president since 2013. Helen is also the first female president of the New South Wales Olympic Council, a position she has held since 1990, and has been an executive member of the International Olympic Committee since 1998. Helen has also served on the Oceania National Olympic Committees and has been chair of the Women and Sport Commission and president of Australian Canoeing, the Australian canoe federation. The sport of canoeing has been thankful for the work and service of Helen Brownlee as well as the many females who have chosen canoeing and gotten involved in the sport because of Helen's commitment and dedication. Helen, congratulations on this award and thank you for all you have done for your sport and our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  I rise today to acknowledge and place on record the dedication and selflessness of 11-year-old Ashton Brown, who is in year 6 at St Francis Xavier college in Goodna. After learning about the struggles of homelessness people in his community, Ashton decided to do something about it. Aged only nine years at the time, Ashton started his own charity, Homeless Helpers, and has since raised thousands of dollars to help provide comfort to those doing it tough. Among many achievements, the charity has run signature local events such as a car wash and a motorbike ride across Brisbane, where more than 100 riders took place. On top of this, Ashton spends hours in his home kitchen cooking meals to hand out to the needy. Ashton still finds time to play soccer for local Richlands under-11 team, but his passion for helping those less fortunate is something his mother, Jacqui, is immensely proud of. Just last week, Jacqui was elected president of Homeless Helpers as Ashton is currently too young to hold any formal positions—not that that will stop him from leading the charge on this worthwhile cause. Ashton has big plans for Homeless Helpers, including the purchase of a caravan to be known as Homeless Helpers Happy Place, and would eventually like to run his own refuge house. It's young people like Ashton who act as outstanding role models not only for other young people but for all of us in the wider community. I commend Ashton for his incredible initiative and effort to date, and I wish him all the best for future successes with Homeless Helpers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:25</span>):  I rise tonight to acknowledge the increased participation of women in sport, both in my electorate of Menzies and generally throughout the community. I was pleased last week to be able to visit the Veneto Club in Bulleen, where new female change rooms have been constructed with a Stronger Communities grant, and then to go to Quambee Reserve in Ringwood North, where there are plans to restructure, rebuild and refurbish the change rooms for female participants. The Veneto Club is a famous Italian club in Bulleen started some 40 years ago by Dave Barro and other early immigrants from that region of northern Italy. It is World Cup time, and the club has produced some wonderful soccer players, not the least of which is Marco Bresciano, who started playing soccer at Marcellin College over the road and, of course, for the Veneto Club.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This significant participation is a great thing. In Melbourne, through AFL, through the leadership of people like Susan Alberti, a great friend of mine, we've seen increased female participation. But we've got a nice problem now, and that is that we need more change rooms and a refurbishment of the old change rooms. It's a great problem to have, because participation in sport is good not just for physical activity but also for mental awareness, and it's great to see so many young women participating in sport. Through the Stronger Communities grants to places like the Veneto Club and Quambee Reserve, we can help to encourage that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  Last week, I hosted a morning tea to celebrate 27 of Werriwa's worthy volunteers and recognise their efforts in our community. This is the second year I've had the privilege of recognising those in our community who selflessly provide their time to help others. They are the backbone of our community, allowing participation in sporting events, providing food and comfort to the elderly, looking after children and new arrivals to our country, and providing calming and green spaces to those in aged care. Volunteers take many forms, whether they are in local football or netball clubs; at schools like Lurnea High, where year 11 students prepare breakfast for their fellow students who can't have breakfast at home; or in organisations like The Salvation Army at Macquarie Fields. Volunteering also contributes enormous amounts to our economy, providing support that money is not available to buy. In New South Wales, the latest figures indicate the volunteer rate has risen slightly to just over 18 per cent, a two per cent rise in the last four years. But I especially thank those from our community who took the time to nominate the volunteers that were recognised last week. It's important to acknowledge the hard work of all our volunteers and their efforts. My community is a better place for the contributions of our volunteers: they turn our suburbs into communities.</span>

Last but not least, I'm so proud and so honoured to congratulate and acknowledge my dear friend Mr Michael Pointer for his Order of Australia for service to the beef livestock industry through a range of roles. Michael is not only a wonderful Australian, he is a leader in his industry and an outstanding role model. Importantly, Michael is a true gentleman of the utmost integrity. These people are all extremely deserving recipients and wonderful Australians who contribute to our society. I congratulate them all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  Being a teacher is a vocation. You give up lots of additional time outside the nine-to-three teaching hours. You give up your holidays and weekends. Teaching doesn't just stop at three o'clock.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have risen today to give thanks to Mr Warren Irwin, a teacher who has dedicated five decades of his life to educating young students. He started out as a teacher in 1969, when big hair, platform shoes and colourful clothes were all the rage, and he's still teaching now at Nepean Christian School out at Mulgoa. He's also been a teacher at Christian Brothers' High School at Lewisham and at Wycliffe Christian School at Warrimoo. His career highlights include being awarded the 1995 BHP award for science curriculum development. Associated with that award, he presented at science teacher conferences both interstate and overseas, including the British ACE science teachers conference at Manchester university. He has also appeared on a children's TV show to demonstrate the Rubens' tube.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More importantly, Mr Irwin is an amazingly inspirational and gifted teacher of science. What I love about that is that he's inspirational. He loves bringing what exists outside into the classroom for students to marvel at and experience. He has not stopped innovating in the 50 years that he has been a teacher. He is currently building an agricultural studies work-and-learning space on the grounds of his current school, and even in his 70s he has an unrivalled work ethic. I would like to wish him all the best and very much thank him for his 50 years of service.</span>

Our country towns and villages are built by those who commit their time and energy to the common good.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was first published on 29 May 1958, by the Cumnock &amp; District Progress Association. The first volunteers were Colleen and Pat Hopper, Nan Austin, Ruth Downey, Bruce Sparkes and Bob Hutchins. In its first editorial the Review stated:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then the volunteers have run through the years and the generations.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A tax on tampons and sanitary products is a tax on women, plain and simple. The tampon tax costs Australian women around $30 million a year, with individual women forced to pay $1,000 over their lifetime. As time has passed, this tax has become more and more conspicuous for its hypocrisy and blatant discrimination. It's a relic from another era that simply doesn't belong in today's world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased to be bringing this motion before the House this evening on the very same day that our colleagues in the Senate agreed to axe this unfair and discriminatory impost on women. But it's appalling and embarrassing that the Turnbull government is doubling down on its commitment to this preposterous throwback policy. At the very same time that Mr Turnbull is running a relentless crusade to hand back billions of dollars to big business, multinationals and the banks, he's pushing back on removing this ridiculous tax on Australian women. Let's be clear, tampons are not a luxury. They are a necessity, just like other GST-exempt health and hygiene products such as sunscreen or incontinence pads. Anyone who tells you otherwise has clearly never menstruated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This issue is one that shows how deeply removed this government is from the modern world—how absolutely and utterly out of touch so many of its members are with basic community standards of fairness and equality. They're going in to bat against the GST on superyachts, but won't lift a finger to remove the tax on women. They think it's fine for a tax to be levied on tampons, but not Viagra. Devoid of any sort of sensible argument, to protect the tax the government has reverted to childish name calling, with the Treasurer declaring that calls to remove the tampon tax are 'silly'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, we see things very differently. I think it's very fitting to note tonight that there is not a single government member who is prepared to rise and speak on this motion. I do want to pay special tribute to the member for Ballarat, who will be speaking later, for her lifelong commitment to ensuring that this tax on tampons and sanitary products is removed. We on this side of the House have a concrete plan to axe this unfair tax. We'll work with the states and territories to scrap it urgently upon coming to office. Any financial impact will be offset by adding GST to 12 therapies which the Chief Medical Officer has said have no scientific basis or any evidence based proof of efficacy. People will of course still be able to access these services, but they will have to pay GST on them. It's a fully funded plan that we have: it won't hurt the states, and it has already secured the support of the premiers of Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia and the chief ministers of the ACT and the Northern Territory. The Turnbull government has no excuse not to act. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, from the outside, it's all blindingly obvious that the tax needs to go, but it illustrates a much deeper and more impactful problem: what happens when you develop policy that affects women without having women at the table? One thing is for certain: if women had had a deciding say when the final details of the GST inclusions and exclusions were being nutted out by the Howard government, this tampon tax would not have made it out of the starting gate. But back in 1999 these laws were drafted by a largely male cohort of public servants, reporting to a largely male cabinet in an overwhelming male parliament. Is it any wonder that this is what they came up with? The reality is that until we have equal representation of women in this place and the other place, until women have equal access to the policy development table, until Australian women have equal representation in cabinet, this parliament will continue to develop policy that disadvantages women. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a plan to fix the tampon tax. It's fully costed and it's a no-brainer. More importantly, Labor has a plan to make sure this sort of discriminatory policy never sees the light of day again—at least, not under a Labor government. We'll restore the women's budget statement so we know what the gender impacts of budget decisions are. We'll subject every single piece of legislation to a gender analysis to identify any potentially adverse gender impacts. With 48 per cent of our federal representatives now being women, we'll have the right people at the table to make the right decisions for Australian women. It's time for the government to follow suit on axing the tampon tax and bringing these important initiatives forward.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:38</span>):  I second the motion. I'm very pleased to support this motion. There are significant financial and social obstacles that still face women in Australia. In our society too often women are treated with disdain and complete disregard. The statistics of rape, domestic violence and sexual abuse point to just that. The death of 22-year-old Eurydice Dixon in Melbourne is a tragic reminder of just how quickly women's lives can be taken. It was because she chose to walk home, which should be a right, not a death sentence. Thirty-eight per cent of women between the ages of 18 and 24 report that they have been sexually harassed in the past year, according to the Bureau of Statistics. Our economy and tax system too often treat women with total disdain and disregard. Women retire with 53 per cent of the superannuation that men do. Women earn about 17 per cent less than men do. That data is one of the reasons why women are more likely than men to experience poverty and homelessness. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has done little to improve the lot of women. Since being in government, the Liberals have tried to cut paid parental leave, calling working mums rorters and double dippers. Their childcare policy creates losers at either end of the financial spectrum. They've cut penalty rates and cut community legal centres, all of which disproportionately impacts women. They've cut almost $2 billion worth of pay rises and support for workers in feminised industries such as early childhood education and disability care. They failed to reinstate the women's budget impact statement, which was canned by self-proclaimed feminist and former Minister for Women Tony Abbott. And now we have them unwilling to budge on the simplest of measures to bring a modicum of equity to every menstruating woman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women are now in the unenviable position of having to rely on the benevolence of a Liberal government still, unsurprisingly, predominantly filled with men to change the rules. Really, I should say 'increasingly' filled by men, as they allow men to push women out of held positions. We rely on these men to decide whether our pads and our tampons are necessary items or not. A classification of 'necessary' is already bestowed upon condoms and things like Viagra. Only a bunch of blokes would let it get to this point. You really have to wonder what their definition of 'necessary' is if it doesn't apply to tampons or pads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to remind everyone in the room that we have to buy these items every month for as long as we have our periods. Menstruation is not a choice. It's part of a woman's reproductive health. While there is a policy in place that deems Viagra more necessary than pads and tampons, the message being sent to women and men is that man's ability to have sex is more important than a women's access to basic hygiene.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those who believe that removing the tax is tokenistic and won't make a real economic difference to the lives of women, I want to share with you what I was told recently by a young woman who had to count every penny while she was at university. She told me that she and a group of friends worked out that it was slightly cheaper to go on the pill and skip periods as often as they could than buying sanitary items on a monthly basis. This is the sort of calculation that young women trying to make ends meet have done. So, on economic grounds, for women who are students, who are among the working poor, who are unemployed, who are homeless, who are carers—for any woman who is doing it tough financially—the cost can be a factor in the decisions they make about their reproductive health. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to all the gentlemen in the room, and I note that there are but a few on the other side: these things aren't cheap; they definitely aren't a choice; and the women of Australia would be better served by you as their representatives if you were to stand aside for once, stop the garbage arguments, axe the tax and let us get on with it—and support this motion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite should not continue to treat this matter with disdain and disregard. These are important issues not just to women but to people who care about women. This government, despite the lack of women in its cabinet and even in the house at large, has an opportunity to take one simple step in the right direction for women. We say, 'Take the glory—we don't care. Just do it: axe the tax.'</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:43</span>):  I too rise to support the member for Newcastle's motion to axe the tampon tax, and I join the member for Macquarie in doing so. I do think it's absolutely extraordinary that not a single government member has been prepared to speak on this motion at all. Either they're for it or they're not. Clearly, they're not, or they're too embarrassed by their complete lack of action to have the courage of their convictions and get up and talk on this motion. It is extraordinary, frankly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This tax, this tampon tax, is the perfect example of what happens when you have a political process that is overwhelmingly dominated by men. The GST was designed by men in the senior ranks of the Public Service, approved by the Howard government cabinet that boasted just one woman and, in 1999, ultimately passed by a parliament that was made up of 169 men and 55 women. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nearly 20 years later, we are doing little better. We've still never had a female head of Treasury, but there are five women in cabinet now—a long way short of equal, but an improvement nonetheless. In Labor's shadow cabinet, we have seven women. We have a parliament that is now one-third women, thanks in no small part to the work done by the Australian Labor Party. We have quotas to ensure we preselect women in winnable seats, and those quotas are working. Labor is inching even closer to a true fifty-fifty equal representation of men and women. Right now, it's at 46.7 per cent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the other side of politics took gender equity as seriously as we do, we'd be much closer to equal representation in this place. Sadly, there is no sign that the conservatives really care about gender equity at all, with only 23 per cent of Liberal MPs being women. That's actually down from 25 per cent when the GST passed. If you add in the National Party, the coalition's overall number drops to 21 per cent women. Not only do the Liberals stubbornly refuse to introduce even modest gender quotas so that talented women can overcome the structural barriers that keep them out, they're now busy tearing down the women who are already here. Is it any wonder that they don't have any plan to get rid of the tampon tax?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's come a long way since the 1990s on gender equity. The coalition, by any measure, has gone absolutely backwards. Be in no doubt that this tax is discriminatory. It is unfair, and it is a tax on women. Women's sanitary items are essential health products. They are not a luxury item. It is quite simply unfair that women should have to pay extra for such items, while reproductive products for men, from condoms to Viagra, don't attract the GST. It's time to axe this tax once and for all, and that's exactly what a Labor government will do. Getting rid of the tampon tax would save the average Australian woman $1,000 over her lifetime. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an age where the gender pay gap remains stubbornly wide, it's only fair that we find ways to give women some cost-of-living relief. That's not just about the hip pocket. It's about sending a message to Australian women that the tampon tax is wrong as a matter of principle. It is not that this is just a pie in the sky opposition promise—we have come up with an alternative means of funding for the states and territories to replace the revenue lost by GST, and it is a fully costed proposal. Whilst there's been talk, in fact, even on the government side, with former Treasurer Hockey saying they were going to axe this tax, and there have been proposals before, part of the difficulty is finding a GST offset that all of the states and territories can agree on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've done that by consistently applying the GST to a range of natural therapies that are not supported by clinical evidence. We will collect enough revenue to cover the cost of scrapping the tampon tax. It's a sensible solution, consistent with the government's own policies when it comes to the rebate on private health insurance. Most of the states are already onboard, and I note the three that are not are all Liberal states and I encourage the Prime Minister to act on that. If we're lucky enough to form government at the next election, I am confident that we will be able to get unanimous support for this proposal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning, we saw the Senate vote in favour of scrapping this tax. There is no excuse. This tax absolutely has to go, and yet the Turnbull government is doing nothing constructive about this. Their only response is to try and pass the buck to the states or say that the proposals we put forward are silly. The Liberals could have adopted our policy in the May budget. They didn't. They could adopt it today. They have shown absolutely no interest in axing this tax at all. That's what you get from a government that does not take gender equality, or, indeed, basic fairness seriously at all.</span>

I would like to read them into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. He said, 'What we'—Tomago Aluminium—'need is constant energy supply. The question is, when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing, where does that energy come from? If it's not coming from coal-fired power, where is it going to come from?' I will give you an example. Last Saturday, 9 June at 6.00 pm, our national grid needed 26,000 megawatts. That was the demand: 26,000 megawatts. At 6.00 pm, we had zero coming from solar power—the sun had set—and the several thousand megawatts of wind capacity was only generating 100 megawatts. So do the numbers: we had 100 megawatts in total coming from solar and wind, and we needed 26,000 megawatts of electricity to avoid blackouts. That's what Matt Howell was saying. But he went on, 'We have people saying "batteries". The truth is this: the largest battery in the world'—in South Australia—'would power this smelter for all of eight minutes.' Eight minutes—one plant, eight minutes, and the world's largest battery. It is clearly a nonsense. Matt Howell has belled the cat on that—we had the previous Labor government of South Australia running a fraud, a con and a hoodwink on the population of South Australia, telling them that their big battery was to back up their renewables. And yet it could only run an aluminium smelter like Tomago for eight minutes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Matt Howell continued, 'You've got to have access to baseload power. As we see the continued penetration of'—subsidised—'renewables, it's hollowing out our baseload fleet. If we want to be a nation that makes things, rather than imports them, we need to have internationally competitive energy.' It's worth noting that, at the moment, the cost of energy or electricity in this nation is more than double what it is in the United States of America. He went on: 'And I would say, if it's good enough to export millions of tonnes of high quality thermal coal from Australia to feed the world's growing fleet of advanced low emissions, high efficiency, coal-fired power stations, then it must be good enough to do the same thing here. To do anything less is rank hypocrisy.' Matt Howell, hear, hear to you, Sir! And yet we have the Labor Party of Australia: their plan for energy in Australia is to replicate the failed experiment that we saw in South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In South Australia, we saw this mad experiment inflicted upon the residents of that state where they had a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target, and that is the exact policy that the Labor Party wants to inflict on the entire nation. And what were the results of that experiment in South Australia? It gave South Australia not only the highest electricity prices in the nation, it gave South Australia the highest electricity prices in the world. And that is what members of the Labor Party want to inflict on the entire nation. Not only did it have the highest energy prices in the world, but South Australia also had the highest rate of electricity disconnections in the nation. There were kids unable to do their homework at night because they couldn't turn the lights on; people living without a refrigerator, unable to keep food fresh in their fridge; and people unable to charge their phones or iron or wash their clothes. That is the policy that was inflicted upon South Australia—with record disconnections—and that is the policy that the Labor Party wants to inflict on all of Australia. It is simply not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a very big job: we have to get the cost of energy down in this nation, and down substantially. Everything the Labor Party will do will push the price of electricity higher and higher and higher in this nation. We've seen the results in South Australia. That is what they want to copy.</span>

                  <a href="E09" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms OWENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  What a shemozzle this government is making of action on climate change and energy, and of ensuring that Australia has a world-class electricity system supporting our economy and our prosperity. The Finkel report laid out a blueprint for the future after five years—nearly six years now—of inaction by the Turnbull-Abbott government. The Finkel report sought to maintain security and reliability in the National Electricity Market that is facing significant transition and technological change. We welcome the recommendation from the Chief Scientist to establish the Energy Security Board and the call for increased security, future reliability, rewarding consumers and lowering emissions. But this Prime Minister keeps pandering to the conservative climate change deniers in his coalition, and he fails to take action. We've seen the entire dismantling of our carbon price framework, making Australia the only country to entirely dismantle a legislative climate change policy. This government's budget saw not one measure to tackle climate change—not a single cent. Power prices have skyrocketed under this government, and the ongoing energy crisis and the chaos in the coalition over policy mean higher power prices for Australian families and businesses. Those on that side of the House don't help matters when they cut the energy supplement, costing pensioners $14 a fortnight. If you're living in a harbour-side mansion, it doesn't matter, but it certainly matters if you're struggling to make ends meet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This national energy crisis needs leadership and long-term planning to ensure the reliability of the national energy market and emissions reductions to meet our international obligations, but this government is overseeing one of Australia's most significant public policy failures, and there's quite a bit of competition for that award. They've been fighting amongst themselves over climate change policy for years. They are failing to act on climate change and failing to deliver climate change policy. During the last Labor government, we decreased carbon pollution by 11 per cent, but pollution has increased by six per cent and risen every year under the Liberal government. For the third consecutive year, the Turnbull government has overseen an increase in Australia's pollution levels. Emissions rose 1.4 per cent last year. And the government's own emissions projections show that Australia will not even come close to meeting our obligations under the Paris Agreement, and that agreement has a ratchet mechanism that will see countries increase their pledges to meet the two-degree target. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Current pledges under the Paris Agreement are consistent with three to four degrees of warming, but our government pretends that their 26 to 28 per cent target is all they have to do. If the government is serious about meeting its obligations under the Paris Agreement, it will have to strengthen its 2030 targets as well as implement real policies to reduce emissions, especially in the electricity sector. After coming down by 10 per cent under Labor, the government's own data shows pollution will rise and continue to rise all the way through to 2020. Australians want action on climate change and more investment in renewable energy, and that's why a Shorten Labor government will target a 45 per cent cut in emissions by 2030 on 2005 levels, net zero emissions by 2050 and 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030. And we'll do this because we have a plan. Unlike those opposite, we know Australia must act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's energy system must deliver reliability, security and affordability, and that's what Australia's national energy market needs, plus a plan for future needs to ensure investor confidence and certainty in the market, or else energy prices and pollution will continue to rise, and confidence in the reliability of the sector will continue to plummet. The Australian Energy Market Commission tells us that electricity retailers are taking a battering in terms of consumer sentiment, now ranking lower than the banking and telecommunications industries in terms of trust in the sector, falling from 50 per cent in 2017 to just 39 per cent in 2018. This is a massive vote of no confidence not only in energy companies but in the Turnbull government. We need to shift to a clean energy economy and take real action to achieve decarbonisation. With the national focus on the National Energy Guarantee, as Mark Butler said, there's a risk of overdoing the reliability obligation and underdoing the emissions reduction obligation, but we can do both. Australia has the opportunity to invest more in renewables. This is where the future lies. It's not just that renewable energy is cleaner and, increasingly, cheaper; it's also because investors, increasingly, are alive to climate-related financial risks. What we see from the government is just not good enough for Australia's future. We must act decisively to guarantee the reliability of our energy systems across the entire energy market.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247742" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOWARTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:59</span>):  It's great to be able to rise and speak on this motion that the member for Hughes has put forward. The member for Hughes has moved that this House recognise the need for households and small businesses to access affordable reliable energy. He notes that the government's National Energy Guarantee is recommended by the independent Energy Security Board, and that it involves no taxes, subsidies or trading schemes. It creates a level playing field that ensures all types of energy are part of Australia's mix, and it provides certainty for investors in new and existing power plants and reduces price volatility. Finally, it condemns the opposition's plan to replicate South Australia's 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target, which will mean more subsidies and therefore higher prices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that final note, that's an important point that the member for Hughes raises, because we saw the unreliability, the unaffordable situation that South Australia found itself in—a capital city within Australia with blackouts for a couple of days. What does that do to small and family businesses? Getting back to the point that the member for Hughes starts with: the fact that households need affordable energy. Yes, they do. But so do small and family businesses. I think of restaurants in my electorate of Petrie, like The Golden Ox, where Mr Nick Tzimas has told me that his bill keeps going up and up and up. The member for Parramatta didn't mention that under six years of Labor electricity prices doubled. I also think of manufacturers like Packer Leather in my electorate, employing over 120 people. They have got probably over $100,000 worth of renewable energy on their roof, and that cuts their bill by five per cent. I really worry for the future of manufacturing and jobs in this country if our electricity pricing continues to go up and up for those small and family businesses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this issue it's really important that we have bipartisan support in relation to the NEG. It looks like a lot of the states are signing up to it, which is really healthy. In relation to renewables and what Prime Minister Turnbull has done here, he is the first Prime Minister to actually mention that we need storage around renewables. There was nothing from the Labor Party about that when they were in office, and nothing from the South Australian government in relation to storage. It's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that has mentioned storage and has been there for it. When we look at things like Snowy Hydro, if I talk to people in my own electorate about Snowy Hydro, they will say, 'Well, that was a nation-building project.' When you talk about Snowy Hydro 2.0, they say, 'Woop-de-do. Who cares?' But the fact is that that is a plan to provide reliable energy as more coal closes and so forth, and it will have that project that our Prime Minister has put forward for decades to come. That's a good thing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to coal, in Queensland most of the generation is government owned, so the Queensland Labor Party owns the generation there. Ninety per cent of it is coal, and they too want to get to 50 per cent straightaway. The fact is that the NEG does provide stability and certainty. We need the opposition to get on board because we need to have the best interests of businesses and residents at heart, and we will. We have signed up to the Paris Agreement. We will meet those renewable goals, but we can do it in a timely manner without rushing to the 50 per cent that those opposite want to do. The fact is that I have solar on my roof, both in my home and in my family business. The member for Dickson has solar on his roof and in the family business as well, I'm pretty sure. It makes sense for businesses to have solar on their roof because they actually use it during the day when they're generating electricity, when the sun is up, between nine and five, for businesses to invest in it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I fully support what the member for Hughes is saying. We still have a lot of coal jobs in Australia, where our coal is cleaner than overseas. Our black coal is much cleaner than our brown coal. We can't just throw those workers out on the scrap heap by moving to the 50 per cent renewables that they want to. We are moving there steadily, smartly, with a plan. The NEG is worth supporting. We really need some bipartisan projects here, and I think that would be a good one to start with. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr THISTLETHWAITE:</span>
                  </a>  It's quite sad that we actually have to debate this motion here today. If we lived in a commonsense world, if the parliament adopted a commonsense approach to this, we wouldn't have to debate an issue such as this. If we were in a commonsense situation, we would all accept the scientific evidence of climate change—that it's occurring and that it is a real threat to our economy, our living standards, our environment and our children's future. We would accept that the major cause of climate change is burning fossil fuels to produce energy—that is the major source of carbon emissions here in Australia and throughout the world. If the parliament adopted a commonsense approach to this issue, we'd accept that, if we care about our kids' future, we must, over time, reduce the amount of energy that we produce from fossil fuels and increase the amount of energy that we produce from renewable sources. And, if we were in a commonsense situation, we'd be mature enough to work together on policies that achieve the outcome of reducing reliance on fossil fuels and increasing renewable energy. If we did this—if we made an orderly transition to a situation where we did have 50 per cent of our energy produced from renewable sources by 2030—we'd have a cleaner environment, we'd have lower electricity prices, we'd have new industries being generated in Australia, we'd have more jobs created in the energy sector in this country, and, importantly, we'd be making a smooth transition to a cleaner future with as little disruption as possible to our economy and the livelihoods of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's how it works in most of the world. In most countries throughout the world they've adopted a commonsense approach to this important issue. But the actions of this government represent everything but a commonsense approach to this issue. The major source of conflict in this government over the last decade has been the issue of climate change and energy policy. In fact, it's fair to say that a policy war has been going on in the Liberal Party for the last decade, which has resulted in indecision, a lack of actions, increases in emissions, a lack of a mechanism to make an orderly transition to a cleaner future—in fact, the mechanisms that the previous government put in place were dismantled—and a lack of investment and creation of jobs in the renewable sector. Most importantly—and this is the government's greatest shame out of the lot of them—we've seen skyrocketing electricity prices in our economy. This has made it harder for families, for workers, for pensioners, and for small and big businesses to make ends meet in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite come in here and start arguing and blaming Labor, but the reality is that they've been in government for five years. For the last half a decade there's been a Liberal-National coalition government. You've had plenty of time to work on developing a policy in this area—just work on one policy that you can agree on to reduce emissions and make a clean transition to a cleaner energy future. Because of that policy indifference, because of the war that's been going on, Australians have suffered. And it's our kids who will suffer in the future because of a lack of decision by this government on this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is winter now, and I regularly speak to pensioners in my electorate who can't afford to switch on the heater because of the increase in electricity prices. Families are entering repayment plans with their electricity provider, because they can't afford to pay the bill up-front. This lack of policy certainty and this government's war and indecision has created a lack of investment in a new generation of renewables in this country. On this issue alone the government do not deserve to be elected at the next election. They've had five years to sort this out, and they've failed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've come up with several policies. They came up with the Clean Energy Target—they had two goes at that. They asked the Chief Scientist to come up with a policy, and twice they've rejected it within their own party. Labor said that we'd agree to it with some amendments, but they couldn't even agree on it. Now they've got the National Energy Guarantee. Again we've said that we'll agree on it, albeit with higher emission standards for the future, but they still can't agree. Guys, before you come moving motions like this, sort yourselves out in your own party room about climate change and energy policy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:09</span>):  It's always a pleasure to speak on a motion moved by the member for Hughes, the second shadow minister for energy in the federal parliament. It's really interesting. This is a motion that is supposedly on the National Energy Guarantee, the NEG. The member for Hughes didn't mention it once in his entire five-minute contribution.</span>

                  <a href="249127" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CONROY:</span>
                  </a>  I was listening well, because that was a foretaste for the civil war that we will see in their party room tomorrow, the civil war that the member for Hughes and his allies have been running for the last five years, the civil war that is the reason this government has flip-flopped on energy policy so often. We had Direct Action, which did nothing for energy transformation. We then had the glorious period of the emissions intensity scheme, which the Minister for the Environment and Energy floated for 12 hours. He did a great interview on the ABC. After that he got ripped to shreds by the member for Hughes, Alan Jones and ex-Prime Minister Mr Abbott, and within 12 hours he folded. I've had cases of flu that have lasted longer than energy policy in this country. Then we had the clean energy target, under Chief Scientist Alan Finkel, which lasted for about six months. Again the government folded to the backbench insurgency. And now we have the NEG, which the member for Hughes is trying to undermine. He's undermining it very actively right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn to the other part of this motion, which is about ending energy subsidies and having a level playing field. I couldn't agree more with the member for Hughes, except he didn't mention one subsidy—the negative environmental externality of carbon pollution. Any good economist knows that a free negative environmental externality is a subsidy to that production because it imposes a cost on the broader economy. There is no greater example of that than carbon dioxide spewing into the atmosphere from the fossil fuel industry, from conventional thermal energy generation. That's why the last Labor government put a price on carbon, because we wanted to level the playing field, place a hard cap on emissions and give industry the best incentive to reduce their carbon emissions. So, if the member for Hughes were serious about cutting down on subsidies, he'd talk about the negative environmental externality that is carbon pollution. Yet again he is running down renewable energy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is, every independent expert and every independent commentator in this field agrees that the cheapest and most reliable form of new generation in this country is a combination of renewable energy, solar and wind, backed up by peaking gas and pumped hydro storage. Every single independent commentator has agreed on that. It is only the fact-free zone in the coalition party room that doesn't agree that that is the cheapest and most reliable form of replacing our ageing coal-fired power stations, which have reached or are approaching the end of their life. They are very old; they are breaking down, as we saw with the Tomago example two weeks ago, which the member was so keen to talk about. Two weeks ago, three of the four power stations in my region were losing units, because these power stations are very old and very expensive to run. We need urgent replacement, with renewable energy backed up by gas and pumped hydro, and possibly battery storage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a great opportunity here. Not only is this cheaper and more reliable; it is the basis for us becoming a renewable energy export superpower. We will be able to export that energy either directly through high-voltage DC connectors to South-East Asia, as they are talking about in the Pilbara region right now, or through power to gas, converting that solar and wind energy into ammonia or hydrogen and exporting that to North Asia, where it's desperately needed. That will give us a great export industry in the future. Once the world makes its transition, we will also be the home of cheap energy. We will regain that standing of cheap energy because we've got the best solar resources in the world. So, when it comes to energy-intensive manufacturing, whether it's aluminium smelting, bauxite refining or steelmaking, we've got a great opportunity to have those industries powered by renewable energy, backed up by gas and storage, and we will be the cheapest possible energy producer supporting those industries into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On renewable energy metals, we have 60 per cent of the world's current lithium reserves that can be mined, so there are great opportunities. All we need is a plan, support for renewable energy zones, and a vision, and the Labor Party opposition provides that. By contrast, we've got a civil war being run by dinosaurs in the coalition party room, by the member for Warringah and by my friend the member for Hughes, and this nation is suffering because of that civil war.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberQuestion">Mr Katter</span>
                  </a>   asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, in writing, on 14 September 2017:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) Is the Minister aware of the hydroelectricity proposal that was originally launched as the 'Tully Millstream', promised by the LNP in 1995 and then soon after abolished by LNP Energy Minister Gilmore, and which resurfaced as the 'Reverse Tully Millstream' and has now evolved into the 'Southern Tablelands Development Scheme' (STaDS).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) Is he aware that this scheme adds 50,000 ha of irrigated (sugar cane) farm lands south of Ravenshoe West of Tully and moves the project from north of Tully, to south of Tully, and should deliver 600 MW of hydro and pump storage power from Tully.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) Is he aware that the Snowy Mountains 2.0 is ineffective in providing security on the north Queensland grid (1 million people), since that grid is nearly 5,000 km from Snowy Mountains 2.0 and line losses over that distance would be prohibitive, making the STaDS proposal a necessary adjunct to Snowy Mountains 2.0.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) Is he aware that when STaDS is added to the 'triangle of power' (Hell's Gates Dam, Kidston Pump Storage and Big Kennedy Wind Farm), the resulting 'quadrangle of power' will add 2,200 MW of baseload power and 400 MW of hydro.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) Is he aware that north Queensland's existing renewables will then be providing over 8 per cent of the entire national grid, which when added to the existing 6 per cent, will deliver nationwide 14 per cent renewables and that to go higher than 20 per cent would jeopardise the cheap $28 per MWh coming out of existing coal fired power stations, versus renewables at over $90 per MWh.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(6) As the STaDS proposal will provide 300 MW of hydro peaking power and 300 MW of pump storage peaking power; 300 million litres of ethanol; 300,000 tonnes of sugar (piped as liquor) to the Tully Mill for processing; and will fatten 500,000 cattle each year off algae ponds (grown from CO2 emissions which will be entirely 'carbon captured' in the algae ponds); when will the Minister commit to the Tully Hydro promised to the people of North Queensland and people of Tully/Ravenshoe 21 years ago.</span>

This includes a number of extreme weather events including Cyclones Yasi, Marcia and Debbie, and other extreme storms for which over 99 per cent of claims received were paid.</span>

However, in situations where a policy holder is not satisfied with an outcome they should seek a review of the decision using their insurance provider's internal dispute resolution process. If a policy holder remains unsatisfied they should contact the Financial Ombudsman Service, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, or seek legal advice.</span>
