If senators in the chamber recall, we had just dealt with item (30), which related to schedule 15, which related to the compliance regime. We separated that out because the Labor Party requested that we deal with it separately. The Greens now oppose schedules 1, as amended, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 in the following terms:</span>

If you recall, we had a substantive discussion yesterday around the bereavement allowance, which isn't always about jobseeking. So we have concerns around all of those schedules. I raised all of these issues during my contribution in the second reading debate, and again when we've been discussing various schedules of this bill during this debate.</span>

I'm not going to be asking a lot on these schedules, because we have dealt with some of them already. I want to ask about the widow allowance. How many women who will be on the jobseeker payment immediately before 1 January 2022, and who would have been eligible for widow allowance before 1 January 2018, won't be eligible for the age pension as they won't meet the residency requirements?</span>

In relation to schedule 6, widow allowance, I'll just take you through the information that I have. As you are aware, if the bill goes through it will be closed to new entrants from 1 July 2018 because of the changes in relation to the bill. So people who would have otherwise claimed widow allowance will be exempt from mutual obligation activities if they satisfy the criteria that currently apply to widow allowance—that is, they were born on or before 1 July 1955, ceased to be a member of a couple since turning 40, have no recent workforce experience and are not a member of a couple.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the forward estimates, the total population of people who will be on Newstart allowance, so the jobseeker payments that we're now referring to in this schedule, from March 2020 who would otherwise have been granted widow allowance is estimated as 4,818 over five years, so to 2021-22. Existing widow allowance recipients will be unaffected by the closure, remaining on the payment until they reach the age pension age, and then they will transfer to the age pension. From 1 January 2022, widow allowance will cease and around 400 recipients who are over age pension age but who do not meet the age pension residence qualification rules would be transferred to the age pension under one-off transition arrangements.</span>

                    </a>  We've had substantial discussion also around schedule 3 and there's already been rejection of our attempts to oppose schedule 3. Raised at the time of that debate were concerns around the women whose overseas portability of a wife pension will be affected, and this seeks to address this particular issue so that that group of around 200 women will not be affected by these changes. So this is to try to make this particular amendment to the changes to the income support system a bit fairer for those who are affected by the changes in this bill. It relates specifically to the overseas portability of the wife pension.</span>

I'm not complaining that others have been grandfathered; I want that clearly on the record. But the fact is that others have been grandfathered, which does make additional complexity. We went through some of that complexity yesterday in the discussions under the bereavement payment. Why was this considered too complex when there are other complex arrangements in place? Also, have you calculated the dollar impact on these women's incomes of losing access to this payment?</span>

Could you tell me whether you did look into the impact it would have on women? I heard your answer in terms of foreign pensions and things, but those pensions and payments to these women are calculated on the fact that there's a proportionality there. In terms of the payments, have you calculated the impact of the loss of income on these women? Also do you know whether pensions from other countries will increase for those that receive them if they lose this payment, or if they are just directly losing a payment? If so, what impact is that likely to have on their income?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 6 of the bill would close widow allowance to new entrants from 1 January 2018 (or the date of Royal Assent if that is later). The allowance would cease entirely from 1 January 2022. The effect of the amendment would be that, from 1 January 2022, women who have been receiving jobseeker payment, and would have been eligible for widow allowance if they had applied before the commencement of the amendments in Schedule 6, would instead be eligible for the aged pension. This will capture a group of women who may not otherwise be eligible for the aged pension because they do not meet the residence requirements in section 43 of the Social<span style="font-style:italic;"> Security Act 1991</span>. Without the amendment, this group may have been eligible to claim special benefit which is calculated at a lower rate.</span>

This is a lower rate than the aged pension. The aged pension is calculated under the pension rate calculators in sections 1064 and 1065 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Social Security Act 1991</span>.

These are issues that were raised by members of the community and also by the National Welfare Rights Network, who raised very substantial concerns, particularly about the provision for widows. I was pursuing questions about that earlier. They are also extremely concerned about the impact on recipients of sickness allowance, given that people who have an illness aren't able to work for that reason, which is why we're seeking to ameliorate some of these issues. We did seek, through amendments, to remove this schedule. That was unsuccessful, so we're trying to ameliorate some of the impacts on people who could be significantly affected by this amendment. Hence, I urge the chamber to support these amendments.</span>

As I've said, the item provides for recipients of sickness allowance immediately before the commencement of part 1 of schedule 5 of this bill to continue to be paid sickness allowance for a period without requiring them to satisfy the activity test for that period or further periods of incapacity that immediately follow the first period. My understanding is that government has made comments around how this particular provision will operate, so can I ask the government if my understanding is, in fact, correct? Could you confirm that? That gives us at least a record in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> of how this provision will operate, so that there can be a degree of certainty around that transition period.</span>

The schedule itself, as you are aware, closes the sickness allowance to new entrants on 20 March 2020, and ceases the sickness allowance altogether on 20 September 2020. Just for the benefit of <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard,</span> sickness allowance is the short-term income support payment for people aged 22 years to under pension age who have a temporary incapacity due to illness or injury and who have a job or study to return to after their recovery. It is paid at the Newstart allowance rate. It is generally granted for the length of a person's medical certificate, up to a period of 13 weeks. If payment is required after 13 weeks, a person must lodge another medical certificate. As I've stated in answer to Senator Patrick's question, around 8,400 existing sickness allowance recipients will continue to receive sickness allowance beyond 20 March 2020 until their current medical certificate expires—so their medical certificate takes them beyond the March 2020 date. Of these existing recipients, it is estimated that around 7,700 will lodge another medical certificate after 20 March 2020 and will be required to transfer to the jobseeker payment. They will be exempt from mutual obligation requirements, if they meet the incapacitated exemption rules. From 20 March 2020, new entrants who would previously have been eligible for sickness allowance will be able to claim assistance through jobseeker payment instead. The new entrants will also be exempt from mutual obligation requirements if they meet, again, the incapacitated exemption rules. That's the information I have to provide to you.</span>

The rationale at the moment is: do you have a job to go to? For the persons that you are referring to, on 20 March 2020 there will be some who go over that date, and they'll be exempt from mutual obligation requirements if they meet the incapacitated exemption rule. That's the first cohort. Then there are those, obviously, who are new entrants, and they go straight to jobseeker payment, and they also meet the incapacitated exemption rules. In relation to those rules, it is then about incapacity as opposed to: do you have a job to go to?</span>

These amendments to schedule 6 are provisions for women who are over the age pension age, who would have been eligible for the widow allowance if it continued to be open for recipients after 1 January 2018, who are ineligible for Newstart due to their age and ineligible for the age pension due to the residency requirements. We're putting in provisions whereby they would automatically then go onto a special benefit payment with the same means test as the current widow allowance so that their cohort is not worse off than they would otherwise have been. That's why we are seeking to ameliorate some of the provisions of the creation of the jobseeker payment, which rolls a whole lot of allowances into the jobseeker payment. That's the reason for this particular amendment.</span>

These are about declared program participants and serious failure determination not to apply to declared program participants. These amendments, as I said, relate to section 13. We're still concerned about some of the impacts, and it's not clear in this provision, on some of the exemptions around declared program participants.</span>

They remove subsection 28C(2), which gives the secretary the power to make provision in the determination made under subsection 21C(1) for the operation of the social security law in relation to people who become or stop being declared program recipients at a particular time, including in relation to things that happen before that time. They also amend schedule 14 to expressly exempt declared program participants.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the Senate inquiry, issues were raised around the impact of sections 13 and 14 as they relate to declared program participants. We're seeking here to make it clearer about those declared program participants. These relate to those sections around drug and alcohol addiction. I'm not going to traverse those whole arguments again, because we did have substantive discussions on those around our previous amendments, the ALP's amendments and Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments. I'm not going to traverse those again. This is seeking to address some issues where the legislation is a bit grey in those particular areas, specifically as they relate to declared program participants.</span>

Whilst some of our concerns here have been addressed, others haven't been. I don't think it addresses the substantive issue we have about the grey area in relation to the secretary's power to make provisions directly around the declared program participants. That's what we have concerns about. Our concerns still stand, but I do acknowledge that there have been some changes.</span>

We would support the Greens in their attempts to go some way to ameliorating these problems. We're very concerned that the government is failing to recognise the complex nature of substance abuse as a health condition and, indeed, the impact that that has on peoples' lives, including sickness, injury and eviction that can be associated with addiction.</span>

It relates to the bereavement allowance. We had a long debate yesterday; I'm not going to go through that debate again.

We had that debate yesterday, particularly as it related to the amendments moved by Senator Hanson. It was made clear then that a number of people will still be significantly affected by this, even with the previous amendments by the government and Senator Hanson, just as a number of people are significantly affected by all the clauses we've been talking about this morning. Having said that, I'll remind people about the debate we had yesterday, which clearly articulated those that would still remain affected. This amendment, while it deals with clause 2, is specifically focused on clause 4, which is in effect a new clause. It's a different vote than the vote that we took I think only two nights ago—it seems like a whole week—in this place on schedule 4. That is my intent and focus with this particular amendment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:34</span>):  I acknowledge that the amendments made yesterday go some way towards improving the situation for bereaved persons, who will no longer be reduced completely to the jobseeker rate of payment. Again, I say to One Nation: if you truly want to support people who are bereaved then we should go back to the income and assets tests for the age pension, not the income and assets tests for the jobseeker payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When One Nation tried to assure the chamber that they had won a great victory for bereaved people, because people would be paid more than they were currently, that was patently false. They were only being paid more relative to the cuts that this government had put on the table, which would have reduced people's payments to the jobseeker rate of payment. All that amendment did was to restore the current rate of payment, but not for everybody who will receive it, because of the change in the income and assets test. If One Nation truly wanted to help people who are on low incomes, who have few assets—who are eligible for the age pension, for example—then they would be supporting the Greens amendment here now.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the minister: if someone is old enough to qualify for a pension and if their assets test is low enough that they would qualify for an age pension but they are otherwise working and they want to go back to that job after they have finished their period of bereavement—so it's a bereavement version—will you pay them the age pension for that period, or will you pay them a jobseeker bereavement allowance?</span>

So, in concluding my remarks on this today, I say to the chamber: if someone is bereaved they may be employed and they may need income support just for the period of bereavement. They're not a jobseeker—they're quite capable of returning to the workforce—but they need that income support. I say to the chamber: there is nothing wrong with restoring the previous version of bereavement allowance. The previous version of the bereavement allowance pays it at the rate of the age pension. We can be secure knowing that it will continue to be paid at the rate of the age pension and not attached to a recalculated version of the jobseeker allowance, which we know has not tracked along as well as the age pension has. Historically, that allowance has been much lower than the age pension, and I would much prefer to see this allowance continue to retain its value alongside the age pension.</span>

                    </a>  Thirty people you're saying will be worse off. It is the Labor Party that has just brought in a policy to do with franking credits that will affect at least 610,000 people. It could be up to a million people. Are they worried about it? Here they are in this chamber, screaming like pigs about 30 people, but they want to bring in franking credits that are going to affect 610,000 people. Let's get the figures into order.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just so that we're clear, under the amendment put forward by One Nation, everyone who qualifies for the bereavement allowance under the jobseeker payment will be no worse off and some people will be better off than under the current arrangements. Payments are targeted to those who need it. Bereavement allowance is paid to people in lieu of work, and this is why it is exempt from normal mutual obligation tests and waiting periods.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's clarify a couple of things. Labor sat here last night, as I said, screaming like pigs that people would be left worse off. No, Senator Watt, they won't. One Nation has made the qualification very generous in its approach to the bereavement allowance. Initially, as you said, we voted with the government. We reflected on that with further information. That's why I introduced an amendment in this chamber. Under the government's amendment, if you look at it, as I clarified last night:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(1) The amount of the person's payment is worked out using the following formula—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">right? It is the 'daily rate of person's youth allowance on the relevant day' times 14 weeks times two by the government. Ours is times seven, which is far better than what the government was putting forward. It is far better for people. It will be income and asset tested, as all welfare money should be. Those people with less than $253,750, not including the family home, will be eligible. That takes out the family home. That is over a quarter of a million dollars. Those people who don't own a home will qualify for the bereavement allowance if they have less than $456,750 in cash and assets. That is not poor people. I don't think we could be fairer. Bereavement will be made available for people earning up to $1,053.34 per fortnight during the bereavement period. In regard to casual workers or people who have no access to leave arrangements, these people will qualify provided they do not earn over the income threshold during their bereavement period or hold assets higher than the amounts I quoted. This is because these people would be with little or no income during this period, during the lack of work.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the chair, I'm disgusted by the aspersions that Senator Watt put on me last night in the chamber. They have lied. Labor have lied and Senator Watt has lied about many things with regard to my involvement. They've lied about the penalty rates. In fact, in the federal parliament in 2017 PHON senators voted to restore penalty rates. Further, in the Senate in 2017 Labor stopped PHON, Pauline Hanson's One Nation, from moving an amendment  to restore penalty rates that had been removed in deals between union bosses, including Bill Shorten, and multinational companies. There was also the aspersion about asset sales. In fact, I've been the greatest advocate against selling assets. I have been for the last 22 years and I will continue to be. Labor's lies, as they have—</span>

                    </a>  The aspersions that have been put upon me are not true, and the verballing that has happened in this chamber is not correct. We're talking about 30 bereaved people that are going to be affected by this. We don't know the numbers of people who will go through bereavement, because death can happen to anyone at any time. Numbers cannot be put on this. The whole fact is that this country is in one hell of a mess when it comes to the welfare payments that are being put out. The welfare payments have to be restored. I have no problem with that, and we stand for those who really need help. But unless we address the expenditure that we pay in welfare payments, we are not going to rein in our debt. There are people who are abusing this.</span>

That is there in this. We will go back to it. Look at our amendment. Don't be hypocrites. You actually didn't vote against my amendment; you agreed with it. But you have used this chamber to put your comments across to discredit One Nation and me personally, which I will not stand for. I am a senator representing the people of Queensland and the people of Australia.</span>

I say 'with a heavy heart' because a lot of the points put forward by the Greens and by Labor are very valid and I agree with a lot of them. But I've come to this decision because we can't throw the baby out with the bathwater, and what has convinced me is the up-front payment to bereaved people. When you have a death in your family, when your partner has died, you need that money up-front. You need it for funeral costs and you need it for immediate expenses. In my mind, that is the overriding issue here, and I will be voting with the government.</span>

                    </a>  Senator Hanson and her colleagues saw the error of their ways, came in yesterday and moved an amendment to try to reverse some of the cuts they had voted for twice when they turned up to the chamber on Monday night. It has been stated over and over again by the minister, both yesterday and today, that, despite that amendment, there will still be roughly 30 people per year who will be worse off as a result of the cuts that One Nation has voted for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment provides the opportunity for One Nation to fully rectify the mistake they made on Monday night. This amendment provides the opportunity to ensure that not one low-income person—mostly low-income women—whose husband dies will be worse off as a result of these changes. One Nation need to understand very clearly that if they vote against this amendment they will be making at least 30 low-income women around Australia worse off every year. They have the opportunity to stop that from happening. So this will be another test of Senator Hanson's rhetoric and claims that she stands up for battlers. Here are 30 low-income women a year who Senator Hanson and her colleagues can protect from these cuts every single year. Labor's going to be doing it. The Greens are going to be doing it. We'll see what the other crossbenchers have got to say. But if Senator Hanson and her colleagues vote with the government, as they do 85 per cent of the time, against this amendment, then they will be making people worse off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In her remarks, Senator Hanson tried to draw some analogy with Labor's policy about dividend imputation. Every recognised expert in the country—even the Commonwealth Treasury, an arm of the government—recognises that Labor's policies will overwhelmingly affect wealthy retirees. There is a very small number of pensioners who would be affected, and Labor's position has consistently been to stand up for pensioners. So if Senator Hanson on the one hand is going to vote against this amendment and make 30 low-income women a year worse off, and on the other hand is going to oppose Labor's policies on dividend imputation, which overwhelmingly affect wealthy retirees, then Senator Hanson's absolute rubbish about standing up for battlers will be fully exposed. She will be actively taking the side of wealthy retirees in propping up a tax loophole that costs the budget $5 billion per year, and at the same time she'll be voting to hurt and make worse off 30 low-income women every year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson, I would respectfully say to you that you should be taking the opposite approach. If you're serious about standing up for battlers, you should be voting with Labor on this amendment to protect these 30 low-income women, and you should stand with us in cracking down on a tax loophole that is overwhelmingly used by wealthy retirees. I wouldn't have thought that they are the people who are supporting you. I would be disappointed if what you have decided is that you're going to become a propaganda machine for wealthy retirees, but that seems to be the decision that you're making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm on my feet, I might also ask Senator Hanson whether overnight she has reflected on the other cuts that she and her colleagues voted for on Monday night. On Monday night, One Nation voted with the government, with the Liberals, to cut the wife pension, to cut the widow allowance and to cut the partner allowance—more cuts to pensions that are currently aimed at low-income people. So far, the only amendment that Senator Hanson has moved to rectify her cuts from the other night relates to the bereavement allowance. Senator Hanson, will you be bringing forward amendments today that reverse the cuts that you voted for on Monday night to the wife pension, the widow allowance and the partner allowance? Or are you going to stand by and see these low-income battlers hurt by your very own cuts?</span>

I know we've tried to go through this as thoroughly as we can. I'm clear about who misses out on receipt of the bereavement allowance. What I'm less clear about is the eligibility of people for a lump sum payment. I'm hopeful that the amendments that have been passed by this place substantially improve people's position. My understanding is that the bereavement allowance is typically paid at the rate of the age pension. What I'm less clear about is whether a current Newstart recipient who becomes bereaved continues to be paid at the Newstart rate or is bumped up to a bereavement allowance.</span>

Apparently they're not, and this amendment will make sure that they're not missing out. I was unclear, for example, whether that lump sum payment would be made available to everyone, but, as you've clarified, it currently is.</span>

It's the equivalent of the age pension over time, and it's the overall payment that is the same—sorry for making that assumption. I wanted to make sure that I understood fully that Newstart recipients are currently receiving the age pension version of the bereavement allowance if they become bereaved. That is, they move from the lower rate to the higher rate in their period of bereavement. I was unclear of whether that was currently the case. Just to be clear, currently, Newstart recipients who become bereaved get paid at the age pension rate of their bereavement allowance. Is that correct?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  It's considered that these people should be able to care for themselves at the time of bereavement. I feel for people who will go through this stressful time of losing a loved one. But in relation to a lot of people in Australia who are on welfare payments and who are trying to support themselves at this time, this is quite generous—having $253,000 apart from the family home or over $456,000 in cash and assets. This is when a lot of Australians are working extremely hard, paying taxes and trying to keep a roof over their own heads with escalating power prices—which I must say are in line with Labor's policies, renewable energies, plus also to do with the Greens and the escalating costs of power—to try and support themselves.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Watt made reference to the wealthy end of town that are going to be affected by the franking credits. Let's put it into perspective. A lot of the people that were getting the refunds from the ATO with regard to the franking credits were those people who were not on tax returns, and they were under the $18,700. So it is going to affect those pensioners, those self-funded retirees, who are struggling. To sit here and criticise about 30 people who have assets in excess of $253,000 and own their own home is a joke. It is an absolute joke. You have used this platform here in this house, on a sensitive issue like this, to bag out me and One Nation with an amendment that we put forward that is going to assist—and no-one will be worse under this—to put across your political agenda. That is not good enough and you are pathetic in your performance.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  I think Labor's position on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017 is clear and unequivocal. We will not support tax cuts of $65 billion for big business while this government continues to attack the poor people in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've always opposed this significant structural deterioration to the budget. We've had this government argue about budget deficits. Do you ever hear them argue about budget deficits now? This will be a significant structural deterioration, and we will not support it. This is a hit to the budget that shows the rank hypocrisy of a government which lectures the Australian people about the need for budget repair. They used to talk about a debt and deficit disaster and a budget emergency but what's the situation now? The deficit for this year has blown out by eight times. It was $2.8 billion in their first budget and it's now $23.6 billion. Net debt has more than doubled since they took office: $175 billion in September 2013 and $353 billion in January 2018. Gross debt has crashed through the half-trillion dollar mark for the first time and it's set to get to $684 billion in 2027-28. So, given all these statistics, it's ironic to think that what the government has on the table is a $65 billion hit to the budget. The components that we are debating today alone cost $600 million over the forward estimates and $36.5 billion over the medium term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, they claim that there are economic benefits, but we've been clear since the plan was first introduced about highlighting the extremely minimal economic benefits as a result of the full plan, let alone the parts that the government managed to get through: one per cent of economic growth in 20 years time and a $2-a-day increase in wages in 20 years time. We hear all these arguments about the great benefits of these $65 billion tax cuts, but the government's own figures show that it's one per cent economic growth in 20 years and a $2-a-day increase in wages in 20 years time. This is at a time when wage growth is at record lows. Private sector wages growth has flatlined in the last year, being equal to inflation. Australian families are facing a nasty cocktail of rising costs in electricity prices, stalling wages growth and record high underemployment, and this government has nothing to offer—absolutely nothing to offer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has long held concerns about low wage growth. The dwindling bargaining power of workers and their representatives has played a central role in stagnating wages growth and rising inequality. And what's the government's solution? Cut wages and raise income taxes. The government has also supported penalty rate cuts from 1 July this year, and they seek to raise income taxes on over seven million Australians with incomes between $21,000 and $87,000 from 1 July next year. They're coming after working-class Australians while they want to give massive cuts to the banks and massive cuts to overseas corporations. What is wrong with this government?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A worker on $55,000 will pay $275 a year and someone on $80,000 will pay an extra $400 a year. So the battlers in the community out there, who are doing it tough day in day out, are the ones that will get hit by this bill, and the big end of town will walk away with big smiles on their faces. And Senator Cormann can go and crack a Havana cigar with them, because that's what he's doing: giving a gift to the big end of town.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor opposes both of these measures. It goes to this government's approach and their misguided priorities that their answer for flat wage growth is a cut to pay and higher income taxes. We hear those who support it saying that it's needed to drive investment. But it was only a few years ago that we had the biggest investment boom Australia has seen, with a headline corporate tax rate of 30 per cent. The United States Congressional Budget Office put out a paper earlier this year saying that the statutory corporate tax rate is only one of the many features of the tax system that influence corporate behaviour, and that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Because of their broader scope, average and effective corporate tax rates are better indicators of a company's incentives to invest in a particular country than is the statutory corporate tax rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The paper points out that at a headline rate of 30 per cent in 2012 the average rate for Australia was 17 per cent and that there was an effective tax rate of 10.4 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Budgets are all about priorities, and this government quite simply has its priorities wrong. Big business tax cuts are priority No. 1. Priority No. 2: high income earners get a tax cut. The battlers, the working class, get tax increases, and high-income earners get a tax cut. Workers earning above $21,000 will have their tax increased, and penalty rates will be cut. That's what you get from this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got our priorities—ensuring that we deal with inequality. We want to deal with inequality in this country. That means properly funding our schools, and proper investments in infrastructure. It also means a fairer tax system, further dealing with superannuation tax concessions, levelling the playing field for first home buyers through reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax, and capping to $3,000 the deductions people can obtain for managing their tax affairs, as well as our plan to impose a minimum 30 per cent tax on discretionary trusts to deal with the issue of income splitting and deal with something that has been in the too-hard basket for too long. And we are proposing reforms to dividend imputation, where Labor is making hard decisions to make sure that essential services are properly funded to improve our schools and hospitals and provide tax relief for middle- and working-class people. Labor is about looking after working people in this country. The coalition have eyes only for the big end of town, only for big business, only for the people who put money into their election funds. We care about ordinary Australians. We care about making sure that people in this country have a decent life—completely the opposite to this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also want to deal with this issue of intergenerational equity, making sure that we've got the policy settings in place for further generations of Australians—their kids and their grandkids. They're the ones we want to look after, because if we don't we won't have the revenue to pay for essential services, such as schools and Medicare; we won't level the playing field for first home buyers through reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax; we won't properly fund our schools, our TAFEs or our universities; we won't have the money to adequately fund important infrastructure; and we won't have the proper policies to deal with climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing fair about what this government is proposing. The issues that we believe are important will not be afforded under this government. This government is hopeless in their position on ordinary working-class people. We've got a better alternative. We always hear the government saying that Labor has no policies for growth, nothing for jobs or wages. So let me remind the Senate of what Labor is actually providing. We're investing in human capital. We're investing in the greatest resource we have: the people of this country. We're investing $17 billion extra into Australian schools so that schools are properly funded—not some rort that the government puts together to pretend it's dealing with schools. We will remove cuts to skills and to the TAFE system, which has been ravaged under this government and state governments. We believe that TAFE is important to make sure that working families can get their kids into vocational education and give them a decent job for the future. We'll invest in physical capital. We will have lots of commitments in national and local infrastructure, such as the Gladstone Port Access Road, the Ellenbrook rail, the Townsville Port channel widening project, the Mackay Port Access Road—all policies aimed at economic growth and job creation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to these policies, Labor has announced the Australian Investment Guarantee. This guarantee will kickstart new investment, support jobs and build the long-term capacity of our economy. Unlike the government's company tax cuts, the Australian Investment Guarantee will guarantee that every dollar spent underpins new investment. We are guaranteeing the investment that will create jobs for the future. This is well targeted and affordable. Our policy will allow all businesses to immediately expend 20 per cent of the value of eligible depreciable assets in the first year of all new investments, with the balance depreciated in line with normal depreciation schedules for the first year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian investment guarantee is a permanent accelerated-depreciation scheme, and it will operate indefinitely. It will apply only to eligible investments valued at over $20,000, with no pooling of assets allowed, to ensure it's well targeted at productivity-enhancing investments. The Australian investment guarantee is a pro-growth, pro-jobs reform that rewards businesses making new investments in Australia. Only companies that make the decision to invest in Australia will benefit from this tax relief, while up to 60 per cent of the government's company tax cut handouts goes directly to foreign shareholders. We want to make sure the incentive is there for Australian businesses to invest, not just to give a boost of profits to overseas investors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been lots of support for this policy. The Chief Executive of the Ai Group, Innes Willox, said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Investment Guarantee would provide a significant boost for businesses to invest particularly for longer-lived investments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed measure comes at a time when business investment, and particularly non-mining investment, has been slow to recover in recent years.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a measure designed to lift investment, the Investment Guarantee would increase the stock of invested capital, boost the quantity of capital per worker, raise productivity and underwrite an acceleration of real wage growth.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stated before, Labor will not be supporting this bill. It sums up the completely wrong stance that this government is taking of giving away $65 billion on a hope and a prayer that there will be investment. Labor, instead, has a superior policy offering. We've put out a significant policy agenda to date and will have more to say between now and the next election. And if you hear this argument about the credibility of the coalition and their economic policies, just laugh, because Malcolm Turnbull, the current Prime Minister, has no economic credibility. Where have they been on economic issues? They wanted to increase the GST. I think that lasted a week. They wanted to let taxing powers go back to the states. I think that lasted a couple of days. And now they're on the trickle-down approach with $65 billion of tax cuts, much of which will end up overseas. Remember, this is a government that continues to argue to maintain dividend imputation and give tax cuts back to people who are not paying any tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear the government arguing that this is about pensioners. It's not about pensioners; it's about wealthy self-funded superannuation recipients getting money that no-one else in the community gets. It's an absolute nonsense. When this government first came to power, it wanted to reduce indexation for the pension. We know who the friends of the pensioners are. It's not this government. It's not Malcolm Turnbull. The friends of the pensioners are the Labor Party. We will look after pensioners—real pensioners, not rich people that don't need money given back to them for nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that wanted to reduce the indexation for pensions and reduce the pension. This is a government that wanted to freeze the asset income tax threshold for pensioners for three years. This is a government that wanted to reset the income test for single pensioners and pensioner couples combined. It wanted to increase the qualifying age for the pension to 70—the highest anywhere in the world. This is a government that wanted to abolish the senior supplement and make the seniors health card harder to achieve. It wanted to cut support for the states and territories for seniors concession cards. It wanted to abolish the mature-age worker tax offset. The government also abolished the pensioner education supplement. And the government will cease paying current aged care payroll tax supplements for aged-care providers. This is a government that doesn't care about pensioners. This is a government that only cares about the big end of town, handing money to the rich and the wealthy at the expense of working class Australians. This is a disgrace of a government; a rabble of a government. The sooner its tenure comes to a finish, the better for Australia and all workers. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  The Greens believe that all Australians, no matter who they are, should pay their fair share of tax. We believe it's fundamentally unfair for us in this place to be legislating for a tax cut for big, wealthy, greedy companies, some of the most profitable companies in the world—many of them multinational companies—who currently aren't paying their fair share of tax. If we do legislate for a tax cut for the big end of town, then the burden is going to fall on other Australians to make up the difference, and that's fundamentally unfair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be completely unambiguous and totally clear. The Greens will not support tax cuts for big, wealthy corporations—not in this government, not ever. It is not in our DNA—unlike the Labor Party, who have come in here today and said that they won't support tax cuts for big corporations by this government but have said very clearly, through Mr Chris Bowen, that they will support tax cuts for big corporations if they form a future government and if the budget allows them to do so. Mr Bowen has made it very clear that his personal philosophy in his book is that he's not against tax cuts for big wealthy corporations. Well the Greens are, and let me tell you why. They don't work, except for returning profits to shareholders and bumping up fat cat CEOs' pay packets. That is all they're good for. There's no evidence that the benefits will trickle down to others in the economy. In fact, we are 100 per cent confident that the burden will fall on the most vulnerable Australians to pick up the slack. And I'm going to give you some really, really good reasons why I believe that is the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You will never get tax cuts from the Greens for big wealthy corporations. We were the ones who initiated the first Senate inquiry, which broke a lot of ground in this place four years ago, into multinational tax avoidance. We've got a long way to go but we've managed to achieve a lot already. People don't understand; there's always a lot of spin in politics—I get that—but the only thing we've heard about in this debate is headline tax rates. We haven't talked about effective tax rates, which are tax rates after the various deductions—of which many are very generous and provided by the government for big corporations—or average tax rates. Australia actually has some of the lowest effective and average tax rates in the OECD—not the highest, as Senator Cormann and the government will tell you, but some of the lowest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only a few years ago in this place we were told that we had a budget emergency. We used to be told relentlessly that the country was going broke and that we urgently needed cuts to spending, including cuts to the most vulnerable—to single parents, to the unemployed, to students—and here we are just a few years later about to give tens of billions of dollars in essentially handouts in corporate welfare to some of the biggest, wealthiest companies in the world. So the budget emergency apparently is gone. I'll bet you it comes back at some stage in the near future, once this tax cut has gone through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give reasons why I don't believe that a tax cut for wealthy corporations will benefit Australia and average Australians. Trump's tax cuts have been in this debate ad nauseam and, basically, we're following, as we often do, the US, following one of Trump's key policies here. But what have we seen in the US? We've seen a very clear trend towards big corporations buying back their shares, and increasing payouts to CEOs and to shareholders. Morgan Stanley recently published a survey of some of the biggest companies on the New York Stock Exchange and 44 per cent of them said that they were going to use the funds from their tax cut to support share buybacks and give back money to shareholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who actually understand finance and how markets work, there's a lot more to this than there seems in this debate. This is not just about the fact that companies are choosing to buy back their own shares or give money to shareholders over workers, which is something I'll get to in a minute, but there are no guarantees at all that we're going to get the much-needed tax cuts going into wage rises in this country. There is no evidence at all that that's going to be the case. The reason companies are doing this, the reason any company buys back its shares or returns money to shareholders, is that they don't have a better return on investment. That's a fundamental principle of finance, which means that they're not going to spend that money by investing that money in their business to get a better return—the best short-term returns being giving the money to shareholders, their own CEOs or buying back their shares.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole basis of the argument that we've heard from Senator Cormann and the Treasury for the tax cuts, how the simple logic goes—for those students in the gallery today—is: we give companies tax cuts, they take that money and they invest it back in their business; that investment leads to productivity growth and, because they get productivity growth, we get increased wages and more jobs for workers. If you want a clearer signal that that is total and utter rubbish, just look at what CEOs and companies are doing in the US. They are not investing this money back into their business. You invest in your business only when you see, for example, an opportunity to increase demand for your products or lower your costs. Most of these corporations are highly efficient as they stand now. They are in very competitive environments and have their business models locked away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are they doing with this handout from governments and the Australian taxpayer? They are buying back their shares and returning the money to shareholders. Apart from the fact that workers are missing out, it also means the entire logic behind this tax cut is a lie. It is a mistruth. It is false. Companies do not agree with the Treasury secretary or Senator Cormann that they'll reinvest this tax cut into their businesses, increasing productivity and ultimately hiring more people—the so-called trickle-down effect. The evidence is simply not there to support this. When you lower tax on a corporation and they buy back shares, it enhances their potential net profits after tax, their returns on assets and ultimately—guess what—the valuations of their shares. This makes sense to anyone who understands finance. Who benefits the most when a share's valuation and therefore the share price improves? Those CEOs who are paid tens of millions of dollars with all their share packages, and shareholders; that's who. This is a rort for big businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are big businesses around the world and in Australia arguing for tax cuts? Let me tell the Senate and those students listening in the chamber today how the system is gamed to the advantage of multinational corporations. These companies are called multinational or transnational because they have operations in countries all around the world. Does that make sense? They go into a country and lobby for a tax cut. What happens after that? When one country goes ahead and cuts their corporate tax rate, other countries then say, 'Wait a second, we're going to miss out on investment and business here, because money will flow to where businesses get the best return,'—the same argument that Senator Cormann has been progressing throughout this debate—and then another country cuts their corporate tax rate, and so on and so forth. This is a race to the bottom. The IMF has warned about a race to the bottom on corporate tax cuts. These multinational corporations are gaming the system. They are going around the world and lobbying to get tax cuts in different countries, and then other countries have to do the same thing in order to remain competitive and stay ahead of the curve,. My question to the Senate is: where does it end? We are going to drop our headline corporate rate to 25 per cent, which is in line with the OECD average; Mr Trump is going to drop his to 20 per cent or 15 per cent. Who knows where it stops?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who benefits? It is companies with operations in different countries, because they will arbitrage and leverage direct foreign investment based on tax rate. They are running this show, this government and many governments around the world. They donate to political systems. We're all aware of the special interest effect, which is so on display in multilateral trade negotiations like the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, where rules are being written for us—our democracies, our parliaments—by multinational corporations through shady negotiations that lack transparency, including allowing corporations to sue us if they don't like the sovereign decisions of parliaments. This is the world we live in. You cannot ignore the reality that this tax cut today has come about because Mr Trump dropped his corporate tax rate, as have other countries in this race to the bottom. Now, to remain competitive, we are doing exactly the same thing. Where will it end? We need corporations to not only pay competitive and fair headline rates but also pay their tax in the first place. Many of these corporations already know how to rig and game the system by not paying tax at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what about wage rises? Will we get any guarantee from the big business lobbies, from Senator Cormann and the Liberal government—or from a Labor government, if they form government—that their big business tax cuts will lead to workers' wages rising? I asked questions of the Treasury secretary and the Treasury officials during estimates, and they gave us a figure of one per cent over time, which works out at $750 a year. Now that is not a step $750 increase every year; that is a level $750 a year. But let me tell you: if—'if'—we ever get to $750, it relies on the economic logic that I've just described, that companies will reinvest the windfalls from a tax cut back into their businesses, increase investment, increase productivity and have more money and more jobs for workers. That's what it relies on, and I'm telling you that that is a false assumption that underpins the model of our Treasury. This is not to mention the fact that when corporations do reinvest back into their own businesses, often it's in labour-saving technology, to cut their costs, and not in giving workers more jobs or giving workers pay rises. That is also not what the evidence bears. So the whole fundamental premise behind us supporting this corporate tax cut to somehow magically, like a magic pudding, create jobs and create higher wages for workers is a false story. It is not the case, and the Senate should not be supporting this.</span>

                    </a>  You may laugh, Senator Macdonald, but my record will show that I've contributed a lot more than you have in this place towards economic debate in this country. So let me tell you what the Greens propose. We propose the best way to get wage rises—and even Senator Macdonald doesn't disagree that we have a problem with wage rises in this country. The Treasury secretary has acknowledged it; Senator Cormann has acknowledged it. Wage growth has been sluggish for too long. We've put forward very good policies for stimulating wage rises in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For three years, we've also run with a platform of investing in infrastructure in Australia—exactly what we need to enhance productivity and grow long-term jobs. That is exactly what we need to do. Funnily enough, some of the world's top economists have actually criticised the whole tax cuts debate and said that the best way to enhance productivity and ultimately create more jobs and higher wages is investing in long-term productivity-enhancing infrastructure. I'm proud that my party took to the last election not only a comprehensive package on how much investment is needed in this country in infrastructure and what kinds of infrastructure are needed but also the best way to finance it, including the establishment of an infrastructure bank. As Senator Williams would know, much of that infrastructure is needed in rural and regional Australia. I chaired a select committee into exactly this thing. It went around the country collecting this evidence. So we have a plan for stimulating jobs, sustainable growth and productivity that will help workers. The government's policy is not the right path.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I've talked a bit about the policy, but what about the politics of this? I'll talk about that in the last four minutes that I've got left. We know that One Nation, behind closed doors, are close to cutting a deal with the government, if they haven't already, to support this. No doubt this has been brought to the chamber because they've already cut a deal. I would hope that One Nation have thought long and hard about what they're going to get in return for supporting what is the key piece of legislation in the economic space for this government in its term of government. It is a bad policy; it is a policy that we shouldn't be supporting. I will say it again: the Greens are the only party in this place who are unambiguously saying, 'We do not support corporate tax cuts for big wealthy corporations.' Labor, as usual, want to have their cake and eat it. Mr Bowen has been out there saying he's not averse to the principle of supporting tax cuts for big corporations. I noticed that, in the last contribution from Senator Cameron on this policy, he was very careful to say that he wouldn't support it from this government while the budget wasn't being balanced, while we had a budget crisis on our hands. But they're not ruling out that Labor will support big tax cuts for big wealthy corporation if they get into government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's be very clear about this. The only party that is ruling it out is the Greens, because we see a different future, a different vision for this country—a vision that runs an inequality lens over every single policy we enact in this parliament. Asking corporations to do less and asking poorer Australians to do more is not going to help inequality in this country. There is so much more we need to do. We can raise revenue by tackling structural problems in our tax system. We can tackle problems of unfairness in our property market by removing negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. We can fix the rort that is petroleum resource rent tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's so much more we can do, and I'm very proud to say to you, Senator Macdonald—through you, Chair—that the Greens lead on these issues and Labor and sometimes even the Liberals follow. Since I've been in this place, we have consistently put forward good economic policies—not that it's often acknowledged. We've still got our work to do to get that acknowledged, but we have consistently always put forward good economic policies to make Australia a fairer place—I'm very proud of our track record—and we will continue to do so, and I'm not at all bothered if other parties adopt our policies. I see that as our role in this place: to push other parties as a change agent, to get what we need in this country to move towards fairness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Supporting tax cuts for corporations, the big end of town, who already don't pay their fair share of tax and already get generous tax deduction concessions so they have low effective and average tax rates, is madness. What we should be doing is actually asking them to pay the full amount of tax. We should be cutting down on rorts and reductions that allow them to continually pay no tax. We should be looking at an overhaul of our tax system, and we should be looking at ways of raising revenue that allow us to pay for our social safety net and support our most vulnerable, including our students. We should also be looking at ways to make the country fairer at the same time, and I think that blueprint is out there for everyone to see, but it just takes political courage. It takes political courage to stand in this place and make those decisions. Once again, I'm proud to be part of a party that does have the political courage to come in here and state a very strong position on important matters relating to inequality and fairness in this country. That's why we've been elected to parliament by the people who voted for us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to hearing the high level of debate from other senators—including you, Senator Macdonald, up next—on why the evidence suggests we should be cutting tax for some of the world's wealthiest corporations, who are going to use this money to buy back their shares, pump up their valuations and pay their CEOs more money, and have made no guarantee they're going to invest this tax cut back into industry, investment and jobs in this country.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:58</span>):  This is a debate, so can I start by referring to the previous speaker, and can I say that, in my long years in the Senate, never have I seen a government of the Liberal and National parties ever adopt an economic policy of the Greens political party. At least Senator Rhiannon, who's just been tossed off the Greens ticket, acknowledges this. She is an advocate of the communist philosophy and policy, and, I have to say, most of the Greens political party are people who follow the ultra-left-wing socialist approach to economics, and such is their right. But, of course, world history has shown that it simply does not work. Just have a look at Russia and the communist philosophy there. It didn't work. They got rid of it. Have a look at China. It is allegedly still a communist country, but all of their economic policies are pro-market, pro-capital policies, because the socialist policy that the Greens political party always espouse simply does not work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go through and expose a number of the myths that you've just heard from Senator Whish-Wilson—myths that the Greens political party keep trying to propagate and keep trying to scare the schoolchildren with. And you did scare them, Senator Whish-Wilson—they left the chamber!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those myths are just that—myths—and I intend to expose just those that I have time to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, can I set the scene? In Australia—we're a relatively new Western country; we've only been going a couple of hundred years—every investment that has made Australia the great country it is has effectively been a foreign investment, one way or the other. There is money circulating around the world. Companies around the world, people with money, look around the world and say, 'Where can we invest our money?' Fortunately, over the years, particularly in the fifties and sixties under the Menzies Liberal government, a lot of people invested their money in Australia, as a result of which we built new factories, we built dams and we built new businesses, and all of that new activity created jobs and prosperity for Australians. We got to the stage where Australia's standard of living was amongst the highest in the world. We got there because of our economic activity, because of good government in the Menzies years and because people with money overseas, who wanted to invest, invested in Australia, building Australia and creating jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't have to be terribly clever to work out that if you've got money to invest in Australia then you look around—you look up all the banks; you perhaps ring your stockbroker or financial adviser—and say, 'Where can I invest my money so that I will get the best return for my money?' Of course you do that. We all do that. Why wouldn't you do that? That's what people with money around the world do; they look around and say, 'Where will we invest our money so that we can get the best return for us?' They say: 'In Australia you pay corporate tax rates of 30 per cent, but if you go to France you can get tax rates of about 20 per cent and falling. If we invested in the United States we'd get tax rates of 15 per cent. So why would we bother investing our hard-earned money in a country which is going to tax us more than anyone else?' It's a matter of simple common sense that people who invest, and invest in productivity, are going to go where they get the best return. The communist philosophy doesn't like that because the communist principle is that all business is bad and capital is bad. But we've seen what's happened with the communist philosophy in the past: it simply does not work. People with money want to invest where they get a return. People don't have a particular penchant for Australia. They will go where they get the best return, and of course that is where the corporate tax rate is the most relevant and the best from their point of view. It's a matter of common sense. I can't understand why people are even concerned about this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will quote a prominent Australian—I was going to say 'distinguished', but that's not right—who said this about tax rates:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a quote. Let me ask you, Madam Deputy President: was it perhaps from Malcolm Turnbull? No. You're wrong if you said that. That quote came from Mr Bill Shorten in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, 23 August 2011. I'll repeat it. This was Mr Shorten:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Correct, Mr Shorten! You were once right. He went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right, Mr Shorten! You were right a second time. I assume that, because of that, Mr Shorten and his team opposite us will be supporting this proposal from the current government, which does exactly what Mr Shorten was advocating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's another quote, if I could just take the time of the Senate:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Lowering the corporate rate for smaller businesses only [as the Greens propose] creates an artificial incentive for Australian businesses to downsize—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">that is, go down—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In worse case scenarios some businesses might actually lay people off to get smaller—and the size-based different tax treatment would create a glass ceiling on business workforce growth. Instead we want a level playing field regardless of the size of the company.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I could ask 20 questions: was that Scott Morrison, was it Malcolm Turnbull or was it Senator Cormann who said that? No, you'd be wrong. That was said by none other than the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bill Shorten, in a speech to ACOSS in Melbourne on 30 March 2011. If you needed any evidence, any argument, those two quotations from Mr Shorten actually sum it all up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I just digress a fraction. I was recently involved in the Senate Select Committee on the Future of Work and Workers. In a one-line explanation, this committee's inquiring into what will happen in Australia in 10, 20 or 30 years time. A lot of the jobs which we currently have in Australia are now done, effectively—this is my terminology, not the technical terminology—by robots. So, what are the rest of us going to do in the not-too-distant future?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was absolutely blown away by the evidence of Mr Michael Cannon-Brookes, who leads a company called Atlassian. He was talking about other things, but what impressed me about Mr Cannon-Brookes's evidence to the committee was how global we are all are the moment. The jobs in Australia are the jobs anywhere else, and we can do them in Australia, given the right scenario. This is a company which started not long ago with a couple of people—a couple of innovators. They were young people who had an idea and started this business in Australia. Mr Cannon-Brookes said to us that the company manufactures software and helps teams collaborate and communicate better in their workplaces. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We currently have 110,000 enterprise customers in over 160 different countries—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an Australian born and bred company, and, remember, a couple of years back they started with just the two of them. He went on:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We employ 2½ thousand staff in 10 different offices, more than a thousand of which are in our Sydney headquarters, and have won 'Best place to work in Australia' two years running</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Cannon-Brookes was not particularly talking about tax cuts, but his evidence to the committee indicates just how tough it is to do business in Australia if we have rules and regulations that make us worse off than our competitors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this instance he was talking about skilled migration, but the same applies to the tax rate, so I'll just read a couple of words from what Mr Cannon-Brookes said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So let's talk about skilled immigration. The lack of access to experienced global talent is the single biggest factor constraining the growth of the tech industry in Australia. From my view, we think about skilled immigration completely backwards. We focus on overseas workers taking jobs from Australians, and, in high export industries like mine, it's just not the case. Highly skilled experienced migrants are job multipliers at Atlassian. For every one senior person we import, we can hire many, many more around them. Their experience spreads to tens of other employees close to them in the organisation. It is absolutely invaluable to me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He then went on to complain about some of the recent changes to the 457 visas, and that's a matter that the government should look at. I know the government's been pushed into 457 arrangements that aren't quite suitable because of demands from the unions and the Labor Party. We haven't got it right. He goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Our future success depends on our ability to attract the world’s best tech talent</span>
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">
                    </span>
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">… today. To unlock the huge job-creating potential of tech companies in Australia, we need to change the way we think about skilled migration. The government should be helping local companies attract world-class employees, not close the door in their faces.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, this is not actually germane to this bill but it gives an idea of how an innovative company like this understands that we have to compete with the world and of the sort of rhetoric you get from the Greens political party about immigration taking away Australian jobs. You can see from a guy who's at the coalface that that is simply not the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same with corporate tax. Sure, every country in the world would like to tax corporate profits by 50 per cent or perhaps even 100 per cent. But you have to be real. In fact, Senator Whish-Wilson rightly says that Australians ignore reality. I'm afraid he ignores reality. To remain competitive we have to be competitive in the tax rate that we charge corporations. I did want to go through all of the myths that Senator Whish-Wilson and Senator Cameron before him had spoken to the Senate, but I'm going to run out of time. Let me just deal with the first one, which was that Australia cannot afford company tax reform. This is just plain wrong, and contrary to the facts. Our business tax reform is fully costed and it is reflected in the government's budget forecast and projections, which show that the budget will return to surplus in 2021 and will remain in surplus over the medium term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For members of the Labor Party, and for members of the Greens political party who supported them through those horrible Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years, I should pause a minute to explain what a budget surplus is. Within six years, Labor, supported by the Greens political party, took Australia's bank account from effectively $60 billion in credit—that is what the Howard government left when it left office in 2007—to something like $250 billion in deficit and heading towards $700 billion in deficit. The Labor Party and the Greens' great economic policies—the same as the old communist regime—took Australia from having $60 billion in the bank, in the kitty, to a deficit approaching $700 billion. It was borrowed from foreign lenders, to whom who we had to pay interest equivalent to the cost of a new hospital every day. This is the economic credibility of the Greens political party and the Labor Party!</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are heading towards a surplus. These are Treasury figures, and we know that will happen. The budget is forecast to be in surplus by the time the company rate under this proposal is reduced to 27.5 per cent for companies with a turnover below $250 million, and is projected to have been in surplus for six years before the company tax rate eventually reaches 25 per cent for all companies. In response to the claim by Senator Whish-Wilson and Senator Cameron that Australia can't afford this, these reductions come in over the next five to 10 years. In that time, the surplus will be real. The Australian budget will actually be in surplus so, yes, we can afford it. We're only bringing ours down to 25 per cent at this stage. It's still not competitive with America and France and Britain. In fact, all of the other developed countries of the world and many undeveloped countries of the world have a tax rate that will be even lower than that. But at least it's heading in the right direction, and it will make investors think seriously about investments in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition, the Labor Party, are proposing to save the cost of the company tax cuts if they are not proceeded with. But they've already committed the entire fiscal cost of those company tax cuts, and more, to increases in expenditure. So Labor say we can't afford these tax cuts, and yet they've already announced that they're going to spend more than those tax cuts would have cost on other expenditure—which socialist governments like the Labor Party and the Greens are always prone to doing. It's easy to give away someone else's money—it's not their money; it's the taxpayers of Australia's money. It is very easy to rock up to some place and say, 'Yeah, we're going to give you a pocketful of money,' and people say, 'Gee, isn't that good.' But someone has to pay for it. And who pays for it? The ordinary taxpayers of Australia—the hard workers who go to work every day, work diligently and pay their tax, which the Labor Party and the Greens then just want to give away for anything that might increase their vote. It's not the way to run a country. It's not the way to run an economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a matter of record that, at the 2016 election, the Labor Party promised a worse budget bottom line than the coalition over the following seven years, despite locking in a higher tax rate of 30 per cent for all businesses with a turnover of $2 million or more. That, as a matter of logic and simple arithmetic, is just wrong. The opposition cannot simultaneously direct tax cuts towards other priorities on the spending side of the budget and argue that they are unaffordable. That's the illogical argument that you're getting from Senator Cameron, and no doubt other Labor speakers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other myths that have been created by Senator Cameron and Senator Whish-Wilson that I would like to have time to dispel, but I'm sure my colleagues who follow me in this debate will do so. Can I simply conclude by again quoting a prominent Australian on these figures—and I repeat these words because they are so germane and so accurate:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Would you believe—you do know, because I've said this before, but you'd struggle to believe—that those words came from Mr Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition. I certainly hope that he and his colleagues follow those words now.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you for your advice. I'll take your advice. It is a guide that we can normally rely upon and that is normally a very good guide to what happens in the chamber, but this morning, perhaps for some other reason, senators who were scheduled to speak in the normal order have decided not to. As it happens, I was just sitting at my desk in my office writing the speech on company taxes that I was due to deliver here, but, fortunately for me, this is an issue that we have all canvassed very widely in this chamber over the last few months, so I'm sure I'll be able to make a contribution without having a speech here in front of me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really pleased to have the opportunity to again make the case in this chamber for why Australia's company tax rate must be cut, why it must be reduced. There are many compelling reasons for this, which we will hear throughout this debate, but I want to take this opportunity to address some of the arguments that have been made so far in this debate that I find less compelling. One of them was made earlier in the chamber by Senator Whish-Wilson. He concluded his contribution to this debate by saying that what was lacking in this debate and what was lacking on the part of the government was courage, and if only the government had more courage it would have taken a different approach to company taxes: instead of advocating for a reduction in company tax rates—as the government is—the government would seek to find more revenue from companies, to raise higher tax revenue from companies in this country. I would respond to Senator Whish-Wilson, through you, Chair, by noting that there is nothing courageous at all, politically or otherwise, in bashing big business and saying you're going to take more revenue from them. In fact, it's the least courageous thing you can do in Australian politics, it's the easiest thing you can do in Australian politics, because what you are doing is appealing to the base political instincts and ignorance of some people in the community, and some people who have deliberately sought to whip up ignorance in the community, by portraying big business as somehow evil, as somehow noncontributors to our society and as somehow evading their obligations to pay a fair amount of tax in this country. It's very popular and very easy to make this argument, and that is what the Greens do. I think it lacks political courage, in fact, to make these arguments. So, I don't share Senator Whish-Wilson's view that the courageous thing to do would be to raise more revenue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that Senator Whish-Wilson and the Liberal Party and I just bring different philosophical approaches to this issue. The Greens are in favour of big government. They think government knows best and they think that more money here in Canberra would be a good thing and that less money in the pockets of Australians, including Australian businesses, would be a good thing. That is fair enough. We have different philosophical world views. They take their approach and we take ours, but let's not pretend that this is a question, somehow, of courage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's almost a year ago that the Senate passed the first part of the government's Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan. I want to congratulate and thank crossbench senators, who, at that time, did the right thing by supporting tax cuts for small businesses with up to $50 million in revenue. But now the crossbench has a different task, and that is to help the government finish the job—to legislate the rest of the enterprise tax plan. The case for finishing the job of the enterprise tax plan and passing the rest of the tax cuts is even stronger now than it was 12 months ago. All of the same arguments made then about stimulating increased investment and the flow-on benefits that would accrue to employment and wages, of course, remain exactly the same.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, there are two significant additional arguments that I hope crossbench senators, in particular, carefully consider. I want to thank them for so far engaging constructively with the government on these issues. In my view, it's to the great credit of senators Leyonhjelm, Anning and Bernardi that they've already agreed to support the government's full package. It's also a credit to the One Nation senators, as well as Senator Hinch and our new colleague from South Australia, Senator Storer, that they remain open-minded and that they are willing to negotiate. But, coming back to these two new pieces of evidence that we have now that we didn't have 12 months ago, I wrote an article for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> earlier this month remarking on one of these, which is that if the Senate stops now, if the parliament stops now, and leaves in place only the tax cuts legislated for small business, rather than finishing the job and legislating the rest of the tax cuts for all other businesses, then what we will be perhaps inadvertently doing is leaving in place an inefficient and distorting two-tiered company tax system. It will put in place a series of perverse incentives and it will vastly limit the benefits of the tax cut passage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the political dynamic here. It is much easier to be seen to be supporting tax cuts for small business. After all, who hates small business? Not even the Greens, I believe, hate small business. A different tax rate for larger businesses would effectively create a discriminatory company tax system that will punish businesses for their success. It's not what we should be doing; we should instead be encouraging businesses to grow. It is a very good thing when a small business becomes a large business. A two-tiered company tax system will do the opposite. It will hit companies with a five per cent tax increase as soon as they pass a turnover of $50 million, regardless of how profitable they may be. It will discourage innovation and create a perverse incentive for companies on the margin to limit their growth or to artificially structure their affairs to avoid crossing this threshold and paying more tax. It will inevitably impact business investment, economic growth and job creation. A two-tiered company tax system will seriously dampen the benefits that we could otherwise count on from cutting Australia's company tax rates. The truth is that the biggest bang for buck in economic terms will come from lowering taxes on our largest businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Saul Eslake, an economist, has noted that the greatest growth in private sector employment in recent years has in fact come from big companies. If we want to see more of some of the record 403,000 jobs created in the last 12 months, it is not going to come by penalising big business. I doubt that any of those 400,000 people, many of whom got jobs in large businesses in the last year, want their employer to be penalised for their success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ABS surveys on innovation also show that large businesses are the most likely to adopt new and innovative practices. Despite all of the propaganda that you hear about corporate tax avoidance, the reality is that it is big business that pays the overwhelming share of company tax in this country. That means that it's big business who is most likely to respond to the incentive provided by a reduction in the company tax rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the facts: according to the latest figures from the Australian Taxation Office, Australia's 2,475 biggest companies—that is, the top 0.2 per cent of companies—pay almost 64 per cent of all company tax in Australia. Sixty-four per cent of company tax in Australia is paid by the top tiny proportion of Australia's largest businesses. They are paying their fair share.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party has also been running an inherently contradictory argument here. They say that big business pays no tax, or avoids paying the right rate of tax, and therefore we shouldn't cut their rate of tax. But, if a business doesn't pay any tax, then how would it benefit from a reduction in the rate of tax? If they pay zero dollars tax at 30 per cent because they make no net profit, then they will still pay zero dollars tax when that rate is reduced to 25 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the companies who already pay billions of tax that will benefit from a lower tax rate and will respond to a lower tax rate with increased investment. The international capital flows that a lower corporate tax rate is designed to attract overwhelmingly go to big business. If we want to attract more of that investment, we need to ensure that the return on that investment is competitive. It won't be if we continue to fall behind our competitors by having a higher corporate tax rate. One dollar of profit in a jurisdiction with a 25 per cent corporate tax rate is more attractive for an investor than $1 of profit in a jurisdiction with a 30 per cent tax rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Economists disagree about the exact share of where the company tax burden falls. Is it on shareholders through lower returns? Is it on employees through lower wages? Or is it on customers through higher prices? They disagree about the proportion of the burden that falls on those three groups but they all agree that it's a shared burden. All of those three groups bear the burden of company taxes and it's a burden which is ultimately borne by people. Ultimately, the cost of company taxes is paid by individuals. It doesn't matter whether they are customers, whether they are employees or whether they are shareholders, they all ultimately pay company taxes. And I think the shareholders, employees and customers of large businesses are no less deserving of being relieved of that burden than small businesses. We all interact with large businesses every single day. Ironically, it was perhaps Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten who made the most cogent argument against a two-tiered tax system. When he was Assistant Treasurer in 2011, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… lowering the corporate rate for smaller businesses only (as the Greens propose) creates an artificial incentive for Australian businesses to downsize.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In worse case scenarios some businesses might actually lay people off to get smaller—and the size based different tax treatment would create a glass ceiling on business workforce growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Instead we want a level playing field regardless of the size of the company.</span>

                    </a>  Senator Whish-Wilson objects, but I encourage him to take up his objection with the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, because I'm only quoting his words. In his view, a differential tax rate between large and small businesses could lead to businesses laying off workers, and I don't think that's what we want to see. I think Bill Shorten was right in 2011 when he said we want to see 'a level playing field regardless of the size of the company'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Leaving in place a differential rate of company tax also runs the risk that the company tax system will become even more progressive over time. I'm sure that's in fact exactly what the Greens would propose. We could see in this country more thresholds and higher rates imposed on larger businesses to resemble the personal income tax system. This would even further compound the inefficiencies that we already may see from this differential rate. And it is not hard, sadly, to foresee a future government succumbing to this economic populism, but, the truth is, we would all be poorer for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, there is only one way to fix this dilemma. Unless the Senate crossbench and those opposite propose to vote for increasing taxes on small business—and one would hope no-one in their right mind would propose doing that—then the alternative, if we want to see a 'level playing field', if we want to see a consistent tax system, is to help the government finish what it started and pass the rest of the company tax cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned at the beginning of my speech that there were two new pieces of information we have today that we did not have 12 months ago. The second new piece of information that we have today is of course the success in the United States of President Trump's sweeping tax reforms which passed the US Congress in December. They lowered the US corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent, with a range of other cuts to US taxes to make the system more competitive. In previous debates, I and other senators have talked about the remarkable investments that these changes have encouraged. I have read out the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of companies who have increased the wages of their employees, who have announced new investments in their domestic businesses or who will be delivering higher returns to their shareholders as a result of the passage of the Trump tax cuts. I won't do that again today because we already all know about the positive impact the tax cuts have had on the US economy. I should point out that that's an economy which already had a lower unemployment rate than Australia and a stock market at near record highs—that is before the effects of these tax cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I do want to talk about is, in fact, the negative impact that the Trump tax cuts could have on the Australian economy. It sounds strange that another country reducing its taxes could in some way harm Australia, but the truth is that it will if we fail to respond. Australia has relied on foreign investment since the First Fleet, and we remain dependent on it today. It has massively enriched our country for over 200 years and, if we continue to attract it, it will continue to do so. Australia would be unimaginable without the foreign investment that we have enjoyed in that time. But there is not a limitless amount of international capital available for that foreign investment here in Australia. It's scarce. There is no guarantee that that investment will come here to Australia. If the returns are better in other countries, that is where the investment will go. We can't force people to come and invest here in Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">America is not just a competitor nation in the fight for scarce international capital; it is our No. 1 source of foreign investment. In 2016, Americans invested $860 million in Australia, or 27 per cent of our total foreign investment. But in 2016, when an American investor was contemplating investing either at home in the US or abroad in Australia, they faced a comparative tax rate of 35 per cent in the US and 30 per cent in Australia, so it made quite good sense for an American investor, contemplating investment between those two countries—assuming that the investment was the same—to make that investment in Australia. That investor was going to get a better return on investment only due to the fact that the Australian company tax rate was five per cent lower at that time than the United States rate. But the same investor making that same decision today faces a very different playing field. That investor is contemplating a 21 per cent corporate tax rate at home in the United States or a 30 per cent tax rate here in Australia. What would you do if you were that investor, particularly if you wanted to invest in a large business in Australia, which still faces a 30 per cent tax rate? Would you invest at home—where it's probably, to be clear, going to be more straightforward, simple and easy to do and has a lower corporate tax rate—or would you invest overseas in Australia, where you're going to face a higher tax rate? If the investments were comparable, of course you would invest at home. It's simpler, it's easier and you get a better return on investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only way that you would continue to invest in Australia with our higher corporate tax rate is if the returns in Australia were so much better that they were enough to compensate for that much higher corporate tax rate. I hope that's the case. I hope the returns in Australia are always so generous and so strong that investors choose to disregard our higher corporate tax rate and invest here anyway, or perhaps sentiment will rule the day and they really like our weather or our cuisine and they choose to invest here. But I think all of us can acknowledge that the truth is that that won't continue to happen. We will have investment returns comparable to any other nation, and if we have a tax rate higher than most other nations then that investment will start up to dry up, including from the United States, our largest source of foreign investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, the United States is not the only country in the world cutting its corporate tax rate. Our second biggest foreign investor is the United Kingdom. In 2016, they invested $515 million, or 16 per cent of our total foreign investment. Today, the UK corporate tax rate is 19 per cent. They have been cutting their corporate tax rate for a decade. Back in 2010, it was comparable to Australia's at 28 per cent. Incidentally, in their corporate tax reform in the UK, they didn't just reduce the rates of tax paid for all their businesses; they abolished the previous differential rate that they used to have for small business because they recognise, as Bill Shorten does, that it's inefficient to have two different rates of tax depending on the size of the business. So, in lowering their corporate tax rate overall, they abolished their different tax rate for small businesses. Now they just have one tax rate of 19 per cent, significantly lower than Australia's, and it's forecast to continue to fall.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nations across the world are following suit. Corporate tax rates are continuing to come down. According to the Tax Foundation in Washington, DC, in 2017 the average global corporate tax rate was just 22.96 per cent, a full seven percentage points lower than in Australia. We are now in the handful of top corporate taxing nations in the OECD, and to be honest—let's be clear—the OECD is really a club of high-taxing nations, so it is a particularly bad statistic to be a high-taxing nation within a club of high-taxing nations. The truth is that Australia is increasingly out of step with the rest of the world. Our corporate tax rate is higher than those of the rest of the world now, and it will get higher still if we refuse to act. It would be inefficient for us to leave in place a rate differential between our small businesses and our large businesses. We are falling behind the rest of the world. If we don't act we will pay for this. If we don't act we will all regret this week, when the Senate decided not to support this tax package.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that the crossbench continue their productive conversations with the government. I hope they continue to show an open mind about this plan. I can even hope, perhaps, for a miracle and that those opposite will come to their senses and revert to the view they used to hold only a few years ago, which I suspect the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, still holds deep down but perhaps doesn't have the confidence to argue for within his caucus. Perhaps a miracle will happen and they will return to the view they all held back in 2011.</span>

There has been absolutely no question about our opposition. Our opposition is not conditional. We haven't been flip-flopping. There's no umming or ahing or sending conflicting messages. It's not our view that company tax cuts are affordable in any environment. Unlike Mr Bowen, who believes that there may be a set of circumstances under which these company tax cuts are justified, we are straight up opposed to tax cuts for big corporations, because they are bad policy. They would be terrible for our country and they would further exacerbate the intergenerational divide that is growing within Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Company tax cuts are just another means of rigging the economy in favour of the big end of town. They're part of the same old, outdated neoliberal agenda that told us that if only we privatised anything that wasn't nailed down, if only we deregulated and attacked unions—if only we did all those things—then wealth would magically trickle down to everybody. Well, it is a failed agenda. The verdict is in: the Australian people just don't buy it. And nor should they buy it. The evidence is everywhere. We're seeing massive inequality, we are seeing wages flatlining, we are seeing skyrocketing corporate profits, we are seeing CEOs cream it with bonuses, and all the while ordinary Australians are being left behind.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from recent ABC reporting—the same reporting that the Prime Minister tried to shut down—that hundreds of corporations with an income in excess of $100 million are paying no tax, yet the government is still arguing the case for a tax cut. When it comes to corporations, the problem we have in Australia right now is that they are not paying their fair share. Let's fix that problem before we start a debate about what it means to have an effective corporate tax rate. We think it's time the companies finally paid their fair share so that governments can invest in what we do know is going to boost productivity in this country, so that we can invest money in infrastructure and services that we need—things like quality health and education systems, schools and hospitals, and a world-class National Broadband Network. That's productivity-boosting infrastructure. We need investment in our outdated electricity and transport systems so that we can make the transition to 100 per cent renewable energy, create jobs, ensure we've got reliability and bring down prices for consumers. Instead, what we have is a $65 billion handout—I'll say that again: a $65 billion handout—to the big end of town in some magical hope that they will pass this on to their employees. It is wishful thinking at its worst. We have to stop pretending that corporations are a vehicle for social change. They're not. Corporations exist for one reason only.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I note that there is some level of bleating coming from the other side! I had a very enjoyable evening with Senator Farrell, but I must say that as the night went on his predictions looked less and less likely to come about.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it wasn't just an election victory for the Liberals in my home state of South Australia; it was actually a victory for all South Australians. This wasn't just any old typical election. We had an interesting third force in it, and that was the Nick Xenophon team. So with all the challenges that were thrown at Steven Marshall and his team and that they had to overcome, it was a resounding victory. It was a great victory. And I think that still, no matter how much of a challenge was thrown at us by the third-party Nick Xenophon team, the main challenge still remained the Weatherill Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been 16 years under this government, which has profoundly neglected South Australia, and I believe that it has profoundly neglected where I live in South Australia—rural and regional areas. South Australia was the laughing-stock of the country, with the highest-priced and most unreliable power in the nation.</span>
              </p>

                  </a>  What about the MDB Plan?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator RUSTON:</span>
                  </a>  The fact is that we've seen a debt of massive proportions bequeathed to the people of South Australia because of the reckless spending that we saw under the previous government. I think that the Labor Weatherill government is a very strong reason that the people of South Australia saw off this very incompetent and tired government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't have to go very far to have a look at some of the things that caused the problems and caused the people of South Australia to decide to move away from that government. There were horrific scandals like the Oakden aged-care facilities and Families SA. This was a government that made an art form out of avoiding accountability and responsibility, and, as Senator Farrell just raised, this was a government which held a gun to the head of the Murray-Darling plan in its desperation to get re-elected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could go on, but I just want to reinforce that the neglected regions and rural sector in South Australia are the main reasons that I believe this government was thrown out, and resoundingly. A great example was South Australia's moratorium on the commercial production of genetically modified crops. This was politically and ideologically motivated. This moratorium has been constantly justified by the previous Premier, Jay Weatherill, and his previous minister for agriculture, Leon Bignal, who is yet to win his seat, on the basis that it provides farmers some sort of commercial advantage in being able to access markets sensitive about GM. However, they are yet to provide any real unequivocal evidence that supports this claim. Growers in New South Wales and Victoria have been able to grow GM canola for 10 straight seasons now. So far, they have experienced no adverse commercial impacts in growing this stuff. I think that the jury remains totally out on any evidence whatsoever that has been provided by South Australia about the advantage of doing that. When Premier Weatherill was confronted with the evidence, following calls from South Australian farmers for the moratorium on GM to be lifted, this was his response to ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Landline </span>in July last year:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The truth is there are not a lot of votes out there in country South Australia for us, so in some ways we are free of the electoral imperatives about this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a pretty sad indictment but I suppose it is a very truthful reflection on what Jay Weatherill thought about rural and regional South Australia. Make no mistake, this cynical neglect was only one of the factors that has motivated the South Australian public—but it was the main motivating factor for me to put my hand up to come into parliament in the first place. If you want to talk about cynicism, let's talk about the extraordinary circus of Nick Xenophon's hastily assembled team of party-hopping opportunists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0N" type="MemberInterjecting">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Farrell:</span>
                  </a>  Now you're making some sense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="243273" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator RUSTON:</span>
                  </a>  I'm pleased to see Senator Farrell is at last starting to agree with some of my comments. It was extraordinary how the media pandered to Mr Xenophon's stunts and gimmicks for so many years and rarely held him to account or asked him to provide any funding substantiation for some of the things he threw out there. But as the election campaign rolled on, and Mr Xenophon went from being the populist 'keep the bastards honest' party to thinking he could be a real alternative to the two major parties, it was quite interesting how quickly the wheels fell off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay credit to some of the people who worked extraordinarily hard on this election campaign. Nobody deserves more credit than Vince Tarzia—the lion of Hartley, as he is now called—who not only won his own marginal seat but also overcame the most extraordinary looming threat anybody could ever expect when Nick Xenophon decided he was going to move back to South Australia and take on Vince Tarzia in Hartley. The extraordinary hard work Vince has done over the past four years as member for Hartley saw the challenge very easily overcome in the end. The people of Hartley saw him as a genuine, hardworking grassroots local member, and he was rewarded on election night with quite an easy victory; he even saw a two-party preferred swing to him. I think Bollywood ads and campaign stunts were well and truly not what the voters of Hartley wanted; they wanted a solid local member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal success didn't end there. Paula Luethen defeated the Labor candidate in a tight contest in King. Paula worked absolutely tirelessly for the entire election campaign and was rewarded by the people of King, who put their faith in her to be their representative for the next four years. Carolyn Habib overcame the incumbent, Annabel Digance, in Elder. She defeated her this time, after suffering the indignity of quite a nasty campaign in 2014 where a whole heap of racist tactics were used against Carolyn. Not to be dissuaded, she came back and ran a fantastic campaign for a very comfortable victory. Matt Cowdrey, Australia's most awarded Paralympian swimming star, fought a very tight contest in the seat of Colton and was also victorious. But that wasn't because he was a Paralympian; he succeeded because he doorknocked his entire electorate. There are a number of others. Josh Teague, in the Adelaide Hills seat of Heysen, fought off a very determined fight from the Nick Xenophon Team to win his seat, as did all our members and new candidates in the Adelaide Hills area. David Basham retained the seat of Finniss for us and, as I mentioned earlier, Andy Gilfillan is still fighting a very good fight against incumbent Leon Bignell in Mawson. A couple of other country members gave come in: Fraser Ellis, in Narungga, and Nick McBride in MacKillop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a great result on Saturday night. It reflected that the people of South Australia obviously thought the hard work, determination and solid and stable government offered by Steven Marshall was what they wanted for the next four years. He has worked very hard and he had a plan. Gimmicks, stunts and playing around were never going to encourage the people of South Australia to support a party into government. They wanted stability, certainty into the future and somebody who wasn't going to play games.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most important thing that will support and sustain Steven Marshall over the next four years is the fact that he has such depth in his team. He has a team of members of parliament, all of whom have worked extremely hard. He has a new team that's been elected, plus a team that's been there for a number of years—a solid team. It was great to see Vickie Chapman elected as the Deputy Premier, so we have a gender equity balance at the top of the ticket, with the Premier being a male and Vickie being a female. She is there because she is an absolutely competent and capable performer. She will be an absolute powerhouse to sit behind Steven and assist him as he delivers his first term as Premier of South Australia. Sitting behind them is a team of great members of parliament who will become great ministers. I look forward to working with my very dear friend and colleague Tim Whetstone as we implement policies for rural and regional South Australia. Given the neglect of rural and regional South Australia over the last 16 years, we have got a lot of work to do to catch up. But I am sure, with the combination of fantastic local members that we have out in rural and regional South Australia and the ministers who have been appointed to support rural and regional South Australia, we are now going to see all South Australians benefit from the actions of their government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="244247" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  I rise to inform the chamber about my recent productive visit to the town of Roma, which is part of one of my duty electorates, the vast electorate of Maranoa. I was very pleased to be able to visit Roma and St George on 15 and 16 March. I want to start by thanking all of the people who made my trip not only possible but extremely productive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I particularly want to thank David Bowden, a long-time Roma resident; a long-time Labor Party member; and co-founder of Labor for the Regions, a Labor association within the Queensland branch of the Labor Party that I will talk about a bit later on. Thanks also to Margaret Wright, the president of the Roma ALP branch, for coming out and assisting me in the mobile office that I conducted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to Tyson Golder, the mayor of Maranoa Regional Council, for showing me around the Roma saleyards, which many Queenslanders would be surprised to know are the biggest saleyards in the Southern Hemisphere. I happened to be there on the Thursday, the day which they call the fat sales, on which we usually have the representatives from the meatworks in attendance. On other days we can see 12,000 head of cattle pass through the saleyards. The record is 14,000 head of cattle passing through on one day. I was impressed with the technology that is deployed there to ensure that the cattle get through the system as quickly as possible with minimised loss of condition. As large as the Roma saleyards are, they are looking at expansion, and I commend the Maranoa Regional Council for its initiative in that regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the opportunity of speaking with Robyn Bryant from AgForce. I thank her for giving me a rundown on the local challenges facing farmers and producers in that region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the opportunity of meeting with members of the Roma Community Men's Shed, and I thank them for hosting me for morning tea on the day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to particularly thank Camille Johnson of Golden West Apprenticeships for explaining the difficulties associated with business and training in regional communities, and in particular for her assistance in organising for me to meet with members of Commerce Roma, a very dynamic group of local businesspeople dedicated to the progress of the town of Roma. Thank you to Cyril, Kate and Ann for attending the meeting that we held.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank TAFE Queensland and in particular Jo Ruddy, the new manager, for allowing me the opportunity to visit the Roma campus. Jo certainly has her work cut out for her to increase the usage of the wonderful facility, which is unfortunately and tragically underutilised at the moment. I know they are working on a business plan to try to increase the patronage of that facility. They are marvellous facilities and I encourage local businesses to investigate how they can make use of those facilities for the benefit of the community. I urge the business community to get behind TAFE and make sure that young apprentices and trainees are getting the top-quality training experience that TAFE can offer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank 4ZR, the local radio station, for having me on the program, and I look forward to catching up with Cameron, the host, on air again in the near future. And thank you to the other Labor branch members who came out to meet me while I was in town to make contact and discuss a range of issues. Finally, a very important thankyou to the locals who stopped to tell me their stories as I held a regional office in the main street—on McDowall and Arthur streets. I undertook to follow up a number of issues on their behalf, including matters relating to telecommunications; the NBN; state government related issues, including vegetation management; and the issue of country racing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, it was an extremely productive visit to Roma, and I have committed to getting back to the town later this year. I'm particularly excited about doing that because I do want to follow up on some of the contacts I've made. Firstly, there is the men's shed, which deserves special mention. They've recently redeveloped the men's shed there, and it's an outstanding facility for the town. The formal opening of the reopened men's shed was the week before my visit. It is an example of outstanding cooperation between the local council, the state government and the federal government all chipping in, together with local business people making a significant contribution to the facility. In fact, I was the first politician to visit the reopened men's shed. It was a great honour for me to be there for that—it's a wonderful asset for the community. I saw Anglicare and Blue Care clients and workers present there. The men at the men's shed are in the process of making park benches for nearby aged-care facilities, and there's a huge amount of pride in the work that they're doing. I made a small donation to the men's shed, and I've made a commitment to them that if they need assistance in the federal sphere I'm able to provide them with that and to support them in any future funding applications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned the Roma TAFE and that it has a big task ahead of it to increase numbers. It is a wonderful facility. It currently has around 450 students from throughout the western corridor, which includes the regional areas of Merweh, Balonne, Maranoa and Quilpie, and it has a range of courses, including diesel fitting, furnishing, metal fabrication, health and community certificates, and engineering. I had the opportunity to see firsthand the teaching spaces for the nursing classes that used to run on the campus. Unfortunately, demand has dropped, and the space is not being used at present, but we know that the state government has invested $90 million in a new replacement hospital in the area. I hope that there will be an opportunity for those facilities to be used as part of that. There are challenges which they presented also: the difficulty in attracting teachers out to Roma, competition from internet based training providers, and the loadings for training in Roma versus more-rural areas such as Charleville. Labor recently announced that if we were able to win government we would commence a review of the tertiary education system in Australia within our first hundred days of government. I'm grateful for the knowledge I gained in Roma, which can feed into this process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go back to Camille Johnson, in particular, from GoldenWest Apprenticeships, who was probably the inspiration for my recent visit to Roma to hear firsthand about the challenges for training providers and participants in regional areas such as Roma. Camille came down to Brisbane as part of a representation from GoldenWest Apprenticeships for a skills and training roundtable that I conducted with Senator Doug Cameron on 20 February. Camille has raised a range of issues, including the tyranny of distance in the Roma area being one of the issues for participants in the training sector and the costs and loss of work time for businesses when sending people to training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, a range of issues were raised with me. I learnt that in Roma the loading, as I indicated, is 15 per cent more than for a city-based training placement, whereas further west, starting after Mitchell, which is an hour outside Roma, the loading jumps to 75 per cent. That means that an internet provider servicing a student in Charleville can claim 75 per cent while a student attending Roma TAFE will be subsidised only an extra 15 per cent by the government for their place. These are issues which certainly need to be brought to bear. As I've said, I'm very pleased to talk with Commerce Roma about the major projects that are on track.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to close by thanking Alexia from <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Western Star</span> for speaking with me. There was a very constructive article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Western Star </span>yesterday. That article highlighted the fact that I see myself as an alternative voice for the people of Roma in federal parliament and that I'm also very keen to promote the organisation Labor for the Regions. It's a Labor association within our Queensland Labor Party that is designed to provide a regional voice within the party.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250156" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to make a senator's statement today on some very important issues related to our democracy and political processes. I would particularly like to address issues of participation, accessibility and the integrity of our democracy. First, I would like to note that there is a staggering lack of diversity in Australian politics. Under-30-year-olds make up 40 per cent of the Australian population yet just one per cent of the Australian parliament. At age 23, I'm the youngest person ever to enter this place, and I'm less than half the average age of members across both the Senate and the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Young people are disenchanted with politics, because they don't see parliament fundamentally as representing them. Their future is not being decided by people their age who represent them, speak for them and speak with them. The question before us is: how do we increase youth participation in politics? In my opinion, central to this must be civic education. The political system has only recently been put back into the curriculum, and how well it is being taught is another matter entirely. Civic education—or, as I like to refer to it, democratic literacy—must be taught early and often to equip young people to understand the importance of taking part in the political system and to help us recognise that this is a space in which our future is being created and in which we have a right to participate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's young people—and I am proud to count myself among them—are interested in politics and passionate about the issues, but unless we improve civic education and encourage young people not only to enrol to vote but also to put themselves forward in elections, their capacity to participate in democracy and shape society in the future will continue to be limited. We must stop drawing the correlation between age, maturity and experience, because it is fundamentally damaging our democracy. This is why we Greens have a policy to increase the political opportunities and engagement of young people by lowering the voting age to 16. And this is why the Greens want to see a much greater emphasis placed on encouraging and educating young people about the importance of our political process in order to improve Australian democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would now like to turn to the issue of the accessibility of Australian democracy. Under article 29 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, it is recognised that it is the right of disabled people to stand for elections, to effectively hold office and to perform all public functions at all levels of government. However, many barriers exist to disabled people exercising this right to fully participate in democracy, including voting in elections, nominating for office, making informed decisions, lobbying, and getting their issues on the political agenda. Policies by political parties are rarely produced in accessible formats such as audio, braille, easy read or large print. As a consequence, disabled people are presented with barriers to being well informed on the policies of all parties. The Free Interpreting Service, which is available to non-English-speaking Australians to communicate with approved groups and individuals, including MPs, does not include hearing services. As a result, hearing-impaired people are presented with barriers to communicating with their elected representatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can personally attest to the barriers that exist in this country for a disabled person to become a candidate in campaigning for an election and in entering the parliament—a place that, prior to my arrival, was not accessible to a person who uses a wheelchair and continues not to be so in many ways. I cannot commend enough the people who have worked to make this place accessible for me, but I am also deeply saddened and frustrated that it took my presence to bring this change about. This is why, now that I am here, and having broken in under such unusual circumstances, I intend to make damned sure that I am not the last.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to note that today is World Down Syndrome Day with a theme of what I bring to my community. Disabled people, as equal citizens, bring much to our communities, our democracy and our country. More than that, we have the right to participate at all levels. It is our society that is creating barriers to participation and it is our society that must change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to turn to the issue that has been covered very widely this week, which is the use of personal information collected, stored and used without consent in order to microtarget individuals with political advertising. The names that jump out in this narrative are, of course, Cambridge Analytica, Facebook and Donald Trump. But there are so many weak links in this chain that it becomes difficult to point a finger and even more difficult to draw a line as to what is legal, moral, ethical and democratic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the centre of all this are the platforms, which, on the surface, are tools for connecting with loved ones, entertainment, news, shopping and so on. But, also, what lurks beneath is far more insidious. These tools mercilessly collect your personal information, habits, thoughts, likes and connections and build profiles so accurate that the product that is you is extremely valuable to advertisers, influencers and anybody who is willing to pay to access you and people like you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we come to the next layer of scum—Cambridge Analytica, who seized the opportunity to scrape your details from Facebook, value-add with other big data and build tools for political parties to microtarget you with just the right words at just the right time to buy your vote. Add to this the fact that the Australian Privacy Act does not apply to politicians, political parties or those acting on their behalf, and you have a recipe for the wholesale violation of the privacy rights of Australian citizens. Your private information and every detail about your life is being collected, stored and used for purposes for which you do not give your consent. You are for sale, as your vote is for sale, and this is legal. This is within the terms of service of your platform and your country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the question falls to us: what are we going to do about these issues? We must contemplate this with rigour. We must consider within this place: how democratic is our democracy? How representative, how diverse and how inclusive is this space? We must ask ourselves: how fair is our democracy? Is it working for everybody? Is it working for anybody or is it working for a select few? How can we do this better? How can we make our democracy something which truly represents us all? How can we fundamentally transform it? How must we temporarily fix it? Finally, if we consider, as I do, that increasingly our democracy is being bought, captured and resold by the special interests of a select few, we must consider how best to take it back.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250216" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:16</span>):  I too rise to discuss the health of our democracy but in this case in relation to the enduring value of our liberal democratic allies globally. I was reflecting on the Prime Minister's successful visit to the United States last month and on the genuine warmth and mateship between Prime Minister Turnbull and President Trump. For me and, I'm sure, for others, it was a very timely reminder of the enduring values that have bound and continue to bind our two nations and, indeed, continue to bind Australia with other liberal democratic allies. The strength and value of this particular relationship was reflected in the achievements a couple of weeks ago of an exemption for our steel and aluminium industries from tariffs in the United States, something not achieved by any other nation outside of NAFTA. We're friends with shared values.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also timely to reflect that democracy, even here in Australia, is not self-sustaining and can never be taken for granted. Australia is not immune from threats to our democracy. One of them, as Senator Steele-John has just so eloquently described, is that our democracy does rely on citizens' engagement and enfranchisement. The sad fact is that, globally, democracy is on the decline. According to Freedom House's global freedom index, 71 countries last year alone suffered net declines in political rights and liberties. This marked the 12th consecutive year of decline in global freedom and the lowest point for democracy in more than a decade. It has caused me to reflect on the nature of our own democracy, and on what relationships and institutions we need to make sure we keep it strong here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very clear to me and very clear to many in this place that democracies must continue to deliver both economic prosperity and security. One cannot be achieved without the other, and both economic security and security itself are required for a stable democracy. This means that we must maintain strong relationships with the nations who most closely share our values and with whom we have developed mutual trust and also genuine relationships. Statements last month by both the Prime Minister and President Trump on the enduring importance of global security, free trade and economic growth are reminiscent of the shared values and the relationships between Roosevelt, Churchill and Menzies at the height of World War II. These themes were also reinforced at last week's successful ASEAN Australia summit, which again affirmed the importance of the ASEAN-Australia strategic partnership. It was an explicit reaffirmation of a mutual commitment to rules-based order, sovereignty, economic growth, regional peace and security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, reflecting back to the height of World War II, in 1942 Robert Menzies commenced a weekly radio address with this observation:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">One of the many troubles, I was going to say of democracy, but perhaps I should say of ourselves as a people is that we do not think enough and that we take too many astonishing things for granted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, as in 1942, Robert Menzies could've been referring to a great many issues we take for granted here in Australia. But in this particular address he was referring to what Winston Churchill, the year before, in 1941, had called 'the most unsordid act in the whole of recorded history'. This most astonishing and unsordid act was actually a little known statute, an American statute, called the Lend-Lease Act. It was a very short statute that was passed by the American congress in March 1941 to promote the defence of the United States. The act was integrated by President Roosevelt after a plea from Winston Churchill to the United States, which was a neutral nation at the time, to provide Great Britain with the tools to finish the war. In 1941, Churchill had provided both the moral and economic reasons for the United States' support. This is some of what he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The moment approaches when we shall no longer be able to pay cash for shipping and other supplies … if at the height of this struggle, Great Britain were to be divested of all salable assets, so that after the victory was won with our blood, civilisation saved, and the time gained for the United States to be fully armed against all eventualities, we should stand stripped to the bone. Such a course would not be in the moral or the economic interests of either of our countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This plea resonated with President Roosevelt—again, the president of a nation still neutral. He came to believe it was in the interests of the United States to support the war effort to defeat the Nazis, without once again saddling allied nations with crippling and politically destabilising post-war debts. Quite astonishingly, this act conferred upon the president wide-ranging powers to authorise the selling, exchanging, leasing and lending of any such defence article to the government of any country whose defence the president deemed vital to the defence of the United States. It also provided the president with post-war powers to determine the terms and conditions upon which payments or repayments were to be made, if they were to be made at all. In the words of Churchill, that was 'astonishing' and one of the most 'unsordid acts' ever: the parliament of a neutral nation giving their president wide-ranging powers to provide billions of dollars of materiel support to other nations, with the power to have it repaid, or not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As astonishing as this unsordid act was to both Churchill and Menzies, the motives, which effectively ended a decade of United States neutrality, were complex, pragmatic and, ultimately, far sighted, and they still resonate with nations around the world today. President Roosevelt knew Great Britain was running out of money to fund its war effort and, when that happened, the US would have to enter the war to finish it themselves and pick up the tab for post-war reconstruction. The following year, in his lend-lease speech, as part of the 'forgotten people' series, Robert Menzies was also clearly considering what would happen post the world war. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A world war makes us a world nation; not a parochial community, but a world community. Nothing so contributes to peace among men as the maintenance of ordinary, decent commercial relations, and these relations can be restored only by the most liberal statesmanship when the war is over.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Menzies, Churchill and Roosevelt clearly understood then, at the height of World War II, was that both economic prosperity and security were required for democratic stability. Australia's future, I believe, has always been, and still remains, a shared one with our liberal democratic allies. In a changing global geostrategic environment, I think this is something incredibly important for all of us here in this chamber to remember—a future in which both our economic and security requirements remain inextricably linked with our liberal democratic allies. To endure, our democracy here in Australia has to keep delivering economic prosperity and security for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">History, I'm sure, will record our liberal democratic alliances as having been an astonishing and far-sighted commitment to the present and to our shared democratic futures, the very astonishing thing that Robert Menzies, in 1942, warned all Australians never to take for granted.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  I rise to make a contribution in senators' statements on my favourite topic: road safety. I just want to give a little bit of a history lesson to those on the other side about some of the promises they've made and some of the commitments they've made which they haven't fulfilled. Basically, to set the scene, the Australian federal government is responsible for regulating safety standards for new vehicles and for allocating infrastructure resources, including safety across all our national highway and local road networks. We see these through the Australian Design Rules; leading the National Road Safety Strategy 2011–2020; infrastructure needs, including Roads to Recovery and black spot funding; programs such as Keys2Drive; and funding for ANCAP et cetera.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013 the coalition released their policy to improve road safety. It was a promising document, highlighting the avoidable economic cost of road accidents and deaths. This was underpinned by the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics statistics for the year 2006. You may wonder why I'm using these stats. Well, in 2006, 12 years ago, the annual cost of road safety was $27 billion. The social cost was $17.85 billion, or 1.7 per cent of GDP. The estimated human losses were approximately $2.4 million per fatality, and the losses for hospitalised injury were approximately $214,000 per injury. Twelve years ago those figures were published by the then Bureau of Transport Economics.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have simply had a great policy brought to this place in 2013, and we're going to go through and see what's happened to it. The coalition followed on with the policy by having a report from the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development. They released their <span style="font-style:italic;">Research report 140</span>, conducted by BITRE in 2014, and some of the key take-outs were abundantly evidence based and clear. There were four priorities: infrastructure, safer intersections, distraction from mobile phones and autonomous braking technology. Mobile devices, more broadly, may have been a factor in seven per cent of all crashes in 2013. Seven per cent of all crashes was 83 deaths and 2,300 hospitalised injuries. On autonomous braking technology, the department found that, even without mandating AEB, the technology is expected to save 1,200 lives and prevent 54,000 hospitalised injuries by 2033. But they modelled a hypothetical scenario to bring AEB forward to all light vehicles by 2018. In that scenario, another 597 deaths and 24,100 hospitalised injuries would have been added to that cumulative list by simply mandating, in 2018, that all light vehicles must have autonomous emergency braking systems. They also found in this very important study that the unit cost, which was around $200, is expected to reduce significantly if it is fitted to all light vehicles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we move on very quickly, without any of this good work being put into practice, to the last election. At the last election you could not find a document in the coalition platform that had 'road safety policy' as its heading. We could not find their road safety policy at the last election. Since 2013, the portfolio has bounced around from the Hon. Warren Truss to the Hon. Jamie Briggs—who remembers young Mr Briggs?—the Hon. Darren Chester, the Hon. Barnaby Joyce and the Hon. Michael McCormack. Very clearly it was a policy position, underpinned by great research work, with absolute economic imperatives and social imperatives: reduced hospitalisation costs and reduced deaths, literally saving an additional 600 Australian lives. What did we get out of that policy? Zero. At the last election, you couldn't find it. You couldn't find a reiteration of it. You couldn't find another report to replace it. You found nothing, no action whatsoever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's happened in the meantime? The US has sought agreement with all the leading car manufacturers to have autonomous braking technology as a standard feature by 2022. In Europe, AEB is mandatory in all heavy vehicles, and they're contemplating making it so for all light vehicles from March 2018. In Korea, AEB—autonomous emergency braking—technology and lane departure warning systems will be mandatory by January 2019. These are really simple, evidence based solutions to an absolutely critical problem. I'm not decrying people's competence or diligence; I'm just pointing out the obvious: a great road safety platform, underpinned by clinical research, showing the way forward, about which nothing got done. Did the urgent overtake the important? Did the urgency of their daily lives overtake a very important prerogative, which was to set in train what the evidence was saying: make autonomous braking technology and lane keep assist mandatory and save 600 lives and 24,000 hospitalisations?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't manufacture motor vehicles in Australia anymore, so what are we doing? Why aren't we making it mandatory for all vehicles that come into this country to have the highest quality safety features, as are being adopted in almost all parts of the world? If the manufacturers in Thailand make a million cars and they want to send them to the United States, guess what? They'll make them with AEB, as it's mandatory—as they will if they want to send them to the European Union or to Korea. Australia is the only place, an island of inconsistency, where we're not going to make mandatory a technology that would save 600 Australian lives and 24,000 hospitalised injuries and would be an enormous kicker to the bottom line. If we're not spending that money with people in hospital or people being killed or emergency service vehicles being deployed—all of the resources we've got—it comes back to the economy. It's an absolute no-brainer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We seem to have a policy black hole here. This is not new work. The other side actually got their act together and had a policy in 2013, which has slipped through their fingers, to the detriment of the Australian travelling public. We've had the CEO of Toll transport—which, incidentally, probably employs more people in Asia than in Australia—writing to the federal government and other stakeholders and exhorting them to have a national platform on road safety. What was the response? Apparently he said on the Ray Hadley show the other day that he didn't get a response. The federal government just did not respond. They literally did not respond to an enormous company which has a vested interest in making roads safe every day. Its CEO wrote to various stakeholders. The New South Wales police responded to him, the New South Wales government responded to him, but the federal government was deafeningly silent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this says is that they started off with a policy, they didn't bother applying it after due diligence was undertaken, and we've ended up now, five years later, with nothing to look forward to—only 600 more deaths and 24,100 more hospitalised injuries—from our road investment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="111206" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LEYONHJELM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  A sign in Bill Clinton's campaign office used to say 'It's the economy, stupid'. It was a good sign. We politicians should focus on the economy and not grandstanding about Australia's achievements on the sporting field as if we had something to do with it, not expressing sympathy about the latest natural disaster hitting our continent as if those affected care about our virtue signalling, not maximising taxpayer funding for our pet government program and not highlighting the private foibles of our political opponents. I'm not suggesting the government manages the economy—it doesn't; it doesn't make jobs, it doesn't drive innovation, it doesn't create anything productive—but the government can make things worse. We politicians should focus on undoing the damage that we are doing to the lives and living standards of ordinary Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have seven suggestions for reducing the damage we are doing, one for every day of the week. First things first, we should cut the company tax rate for all businesses. Currently, for every $100 of profit that a medium to large Australian company makes by producing and selling things of value, the government takes $30. This leaves the company with up to $70 to reinvest so that the company can make and sell even more things of value. This is a matter of great concern to the company's owners, its shareholders, who have invested their money in the company. They would prefer a lower company tax rate because when a company keeps more money, that money earns a return and the value of their investment increases. It's the same for foreigners who invest their money in Australia, but in their case they have other countries where they can invest. If our government takes $30 of their investment while the government in another country takes only $15 or $20, those foreigners aren't silly enough to keep investing here. Quite simply, Australia's company tax rate discourages investment and hurts job creation and wage growth. To undo this damage, the government must reduce the company tax rate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing we politicians must do to reduce the damage we're doing to the lives and living standards of Australians is to reduce other taxes. The top marginal tax rate discourages Australians to work and save, encourages skilled Australians to work and live overseas, and discourages skilled foreigners from making Australia their home. Arbitrary fuel, alcohol and tobacco taxes damage the living standards of Australians by increasing their cost of living and discouraging them from spending their money on the things that they want. And import tariffs, including punitive taxes imposed in the name of antidumping, have the added detriment of discouraging Australian businesses from producing what they are best at, instead encouraging them to produce what other countries can more cheaply provide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third thing we must do to reduce the damage we are doing to the lives and living standards of Australians is to stop impeding development. We must make it easier to undertake investments and we must lower the cost of meeting our environmental standards. We must remove duplication in federal and state environmental approval processes. We must remove the ban on the development of nuclear energy and waste projects, and we must prevent busybodies who are unaffected by new developments from challenging those developments' environmental approvals. This would signal to entrepreneurs and investors that they are more likely to receive development approval, it will cost them less and the wait for approval will be shorter. There is no better way to protect the long-term employment of thousands of forestry, mining and tourism workers than to signal that Australia is truly open for business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth thing we politicians must do to reduce the damage we're doing to the lives and living standards of Australians is to cut off the poison of lifelong welfare. Welfare is charity; it's not a right, and it's not something that should last a lifetime or extend over generations. We let school leavers go straight onto the dole, making welfare dependency the norm rather than a path to be avoided. We allow far too many disability support pensioners to remain on the pension without reviewing their disability. We impose no obligation on the unemployed to move to where jobs are. And we reserve the worst treatment for Aboriginal welfare recipients in remote areas. Unlike other welfare recipients, these welfare recipients face no obligation to look for a real job, and they can abuse drugs and alcohol without any risk to their welfare payments. This is the prejudice of low expectations. Welfare dependency wastes the nation's human capital and consigns hundreds of thousands of Australians to intergenerational squalor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fifth thing we politicians must do to reduce the damage we're doing to Australia's economy is to cut government spending. No more billions for intergovernmental grants; no more billions for middle-class welfare, like family tax benefits for families with six-figure incomes; no more billions for the salaries of thousands of Canberra public servants in a health department that runs no hospitals, an education department that runs no schools and an environment department that duplicates the obstacles imposed by state environment departments. A big-spending government gives rise to a big tax burden. It prompts debt and deficit that threatens to degrade the country's credit rating, leading to higher interest rates for everyone, and that threatens to distort our exchange rate to the detriment of our export industries. And when big-spending governments deliver or subsidise services, this thwarts service delivery by competitive private markets instead. This wastes resources and makes us all poorer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sixth thing we must do to stop damaging the lives and living standards of ordinary Australians is to get off the backs of employers. Currently, they can't hire permanently without losing the option of firing, and they can't employ someone on a salary that corresponds to their contribution to the business because of one-size-fits-all wage regulations, including penalty rates and the minimum wage. Less damaging industrial relations would also mean allowing more foreign ships to compete for freight jobs along Australia's coast and allowing Australian ships to pay lower wages when bidding for work in international waters. These changes would reduce the costs to Australian consumers and businesses of traded goods and promote the employment of more Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the seventh thing we politicians must do to stop damaging the lives and living standards of ordinary Australians is to stop intervening in the energy market. We must abolish the renewable energy target and stop energy subsidies. We must withdraw from the Paris accord, make no commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions unless the rest of the world does the same and abolish government agencies and banks that devote taxpayers' funds to propping up renewable energy. Bringing down prohibitively high electricity prices will save Australian businesses, particularly our remaining manufacturers, and give relief to every household in the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government doesn't manage the economy; it screws it up. It's time politicians stopped obsessing about the inconsequential and starting undoing the damage that has been done by a generation of politicians with little understanding of business and prosperity. Time is running out.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  It's not often that senators come to the Australian Senate and begin with a quote from Mao Zedong, so let me be the first. We know that when Mao Zedong remarked that a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step he was not thinking about the task of getting a better GST distribution deal for Western Australia. But when we pause to reflect on the journey that has been Western Australia's long march towards GST reform, every Western Australian can be proud that those first lonely steps have turned into the thunderous sound of a state demanding reform. So it's important for Western Australians to appreciate how far they have come over the last few years and, more importantly, to stay resolute in their calls for fairness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth recapping the history. Western Australia's argument for a fairer GST deal has come a very, very long way. It was just over 10 years ago, in 2007, that the perils of the GST distribution system were first identified. It's worth noting that they were first identified by the former Labor state Treasurer, Eric Ripper, who foresaw the GST challenge, accurately predicting that by 2010 Western Australia would receive just 7.5 per cent of the GST and that, if by 2015 there had been, in his words, an eight-year period where WA's growth rate was far ahead of other states, WA would be down to 5.9 per cent of the GST. He also added that the GST would take more than $12 billion out of the state's finances. At the time, WA received nine per cent of the GST, or a relativity of 94c in the dollar. By 2010, WA had dropped to seven per cent, or 68c relativity. By 2015, it was at 4.1 per cent, or 29.9c in every dollar returned to Western Australia. Eric Ripper and officials at WA Treasury had a prophetic ability to see the GST future for my home state of Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost six years ago, in 2012, I used my first speech in the Senate to call for GST reform, urging the Liberal Party to rise to the challenge. I said that the decline in GST payments to Western Australia was the most damaging national issue for our state and that every Western Australian would feel the pain if the matter were not swiftly addressed. I argued that it was critical that states were rewarded for economic success and that no state or territory was given a free lunch. In hindsight, those days, in 2012, were the glory days, when Western Australia was getting 55c in every GST dollar. Just over three years ago, nine federal WA Liberal backbenchers argued the case for GST distribution reform in a letter to then Treasurer Joe Hockey. The letter said that the issue of GST distribution was the most salient and talked about federal political issue for Western Australians. The letter went on to say that Australia's economic national best interest is well served by an economic reform initiative such as GST distribution reform. At the time, Western Australia received just 37c in every dollar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the case was argued in Canberra—often uncomfortably for WA Liberals, I think it's worth adding—Liberal leaders have been graciously recognising WA's pleas for GST reform. Then Prime Minister Tony Abbott said it should be possible to make these arrangements more equitable. The then federal Treasurer Joe Hockey said most Australians would consider it unreasonable that a state would have only 30c of every dollar spent on the GST returned to that state. What followed was a specific acknowledgement of the unique circumstances facing Western Australia as a result of the GST revenue shortfall. First, there was a $499 million road infrastructure package that supported new funds for projects including the Mitchell Freeway extension, widening of parts of the Kwinana Freeway, the NorthLink WA project, and grade separations on the Reid and Roe highways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When he became the new Treasurer, Scott Morrison conceded that Western Australia did have a case. He has acknowledged that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">What we need is to properly deal with the causes of the problem, not the symptoms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He more recently has stated that, 'It's in the national interest to fix … the GST' and make sure that it's shared fairly and appropriately between the states and territories. Now the Treasurer can be heard saying that he has 'a lot of sympathy for the absurdity of the outcomes'—and the outcomes he's referring to are the GST distribution system outcomes. In 2016, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull used an address to the Liberal Party in Western Australia to publicly acknowledge the unfairness of WA's GST return, saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the huge gap between what Western Australians pay in GST and what they receive back is unprecedented and Western Australians have every right to feel aggrieved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016, WA received a second infrastructure package to ensure that Western Australia's share of the GST effectively remained at its previous 2014-15 levels. The federal GST top-up payment for Western Australia centred on the $490 million investment in the Forrestfield-Airport Link project and meant more than $1.2 million in federal GST top-up payments had been paid to Western Australia since April 2015. In May last year, Western Australia was the beneficiary of $2.3 billion worth of new infrastructure spending that married road and rail priorities of the new state Labor government with coalition government priorities. This is funding that will bring to life Labor's METRONET and 17 metropolitan and regional road projects. The funding also included a $226 million top-up payment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There can be no denying that the GST squeaky wheel has got some oil for Western Australia. But extra funding for infrastructure spending and top-up payments—as worthy and important as they are, as a recognition of the genuine plight of Western Australia from a broken GST system—is not GST distribution reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mother of all GST victories thus far has been securing an independent review of horizontal fiscal equalisation by the Productivity Commission. The process has proven to be a critically important one, and, I would argue, a successful one. It's successful because it has demonstrated that the system is broken. Among the almost 60 detailed submissions, the Australian business community, the resources industry and others have called for reform. The Business Council of Australia, supporting the principal of HFE, expressed concern that its implementation had become a barrier to national reform, a barrier to interstate cooperation and a barrier to broad based tax reform. Prominent Australian business identities Michael Chaney and Andrew Forrest have lent their names and their ideas to the cause of reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what do we know from the draft report thus far? We know it has been confirmed that WA's GST has fallen to an unprecedented low and that this new low had been anticipated since 2011, but that, at the time the GST deal was struck in 1999, it was unknown and unforeseen. It has been confirmed that the three-year assessment period and the two-year lag in the system resulting in declining GST relativities coincided with falls in royalty revenues in Western Australia, thereby exacerbating the effects of the economic cycle in WA's state budget. We've also had it confirmed that the potential to lose GST payments could in fact discourage states from pursuing efficiency-enhancing reforms that are in the national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The draft report, with its 17 findings and six draft recommendations, paints a pathway for reform that maintains the principal of horizontal fiscal equalisation for our Commonwealth but adopts improvements to create greater incentives for states to contribute to national economic reform. It's a pathway that is in the national interest, and it meets WA's interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It speaks to the single-mindedness and determination of Western Australian Liberals that the idea was subsequently embraced and the inquiry publicly announced on 30 April 2017. The decision to extend the reporting date for the final report to May should in fact be welcomed for a variety of reasons. The most significant reason is that it will allow the Productivity Commission to put its mind more carefully to the issue of how best to transition to a better GST regime—a transition that accommodates the concerns of states like Tasmania, South Australia and others. And in highlighting the importance of the transitional arrangement, the chamber of commerce in Western Australia has been correct to highlight three key principles: the first principle being that of fairness, the second principle being that of pro-growth and the third principle being one of stability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just make this final point, and it's revealed in the response from the Business Council of Australia to the draft report. GST distribution reform is an element—one element—of many elements in the broader case and the broader argument for federal financial reform in Australia. I argue that every state in this country should be given greater financial independence; GST distribution is just one way to achieve that.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  I rise today, in sadness, to note the death of Sudan, this planet's last male northern white rhinoceros. On Monday, Joseph Thuita, from Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, comforted Sudan before he passed away. In the words of Leonardo DiCaprio, 'We are witnessing the extinction of a species that survived for millions of years but could not survive mankind.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sudan had been an inspirational rhino across the world. Thousands had come to Ol Pejeta in Kenya to see him, raising awareness of rhino conservation. Two female northern white rhinoceroses survive him and they're surrounded by armed guards 24 hours a day to protect them from poaching. Neither of them, though, is capable of bearing young.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The poaching crisis in Africa is one of the most pressing conservation crises of the modern day, and Australia has a role to play in ending it. Each year, between 20,000 and 50,000 elephants are being poached for their tusks. In 2017, 1,028 rhinoceroses were poached in South Africa. We had 25 species of rhinoceros 100 years ago. Today, only five species are left, including those last two female northern whites. The existence of legal domestic markets around the world continues to fuel the poaching crisis in Africa. In the past two years, there have been numerous requests for assistance at the United Nations General Assembly and the International Union for Conservation for Nature and through CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, for member states like Australia to take all necessary steps to close legal domestic ivory markets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why domestic bans on trade in ivory and rhino horn are now being seriously considered and implemented by the international community. In 2016 the United States announced a policy to ban all domestic trade in ivory, with state governments passing legislation to implement the nationwide policy. China, which represents 70 per cent of the global ivory trade, announced in December 2016 that it would close all ivory-carving factories and retail outlets in the country by 31 December 2017, which is an incredible feat for China, recognising the trade it consumed. Hong Kong, similarly, passed legislation in January 2018, with a ban to be implemented by 2020. The European Union and the United Kingdom have recently completed public consultations on policies to implement domestic bans in their jurisdictions. These bans have already had an impact. The wholesale price of ivory has tumbled from US$2,100 to US$660 per kilo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is not immune from contributing to this global problem as both a consumer market and, given our close proximity to Asia, a transit route. In the last decade 322 imported and 79 exported ivory items have been confiscated by Australian authorities, along with 24 rhinoceros products. But there is still a significant regulatory gap in relation to the commercial sale of such products in Australia, including the lack of consistency for ivory and rhinoceros horn provenance documentation. Investigations of online traders, auction houses and antique dealers, undertaken over a number of years by the International Fund for Animal Welfare, found Australia had both legal and illegal domestic markets for elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn, worth thousands of dollars annually.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some industry stakeholders are recognising the role they play in reducing demand for wildlife products, including ivory. Leading Australian auction house Leonard Joel has implemented a policy to cease trading in any rhinoceros and ivory products, while major online trading platforms, including eBay, Google and Alibaba, have joined an international coalition to strengthen policies to reduce trade. The existence of legal domestic markets and trade in ivory and rhinoceros horn anywhere is a direct threat to the future of elephants and rhinoceroses everywhere. The Australian government must start playing its role to close our domestic ivory and rhinoceros horn markets now, so that we don't see a further extinction of species and rhinos like Sudan. Australia must follow in the steps of other nations across the world. I urge Minister Frydenberg to do something about it, so that we can see an end to the domestic trade of ivory and rhinoceros horn in Australia.</span>

The closest that many of you on the other side have ever come to a business is to close it down. Employees need employers, and those of us on this side understand that what governments do is put in place the policy framework under which business can either prosper and grow—400,000 jobs created in the economy under the Turnbull government last year, with 300,000 of them being full-time jobs, versus the last 12 months of the former Labor government, when a fifth of that number of jobs were created.

I thank Senator Abetz for his question. The signing of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for a Trans-Pacific Partnership with the TPP-11 in Chile earlier this month was a significant moment for open markets, for free trade, and for the rules-based international system. The Turnbull government took a leadership role in the negotiations to conclude the TPP-11 soon after the United States indicated its intention to withdraw from the original agreement. We recognised the potential and the opportunities that the agreement would deliver for Australian exports, and particularly the jobs it would help to create.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Labor Party, those opposite, said to give up—they said the TPP was dead—we were relentless in our pursuit of new opportunities and greater market access for Australian businesses in our trade zone, which has a combined GDP of A$13.7 trillion. In fact, in 2016-17, nearly one-quarter of Australia's total exports, worth nearly $88 billion, went to TPP-11 countries. That will only continue to grow, thanks to the significant increase in market access the TPP-11 gives to Australian exporters. The TPP-11 will give us new trade agreements with Canada and Mexico, and greater market access to Japan, Chile, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei. In fact, the Turnbull government has the most ambitious trade agenda in Australia's history. It is delivering jobs and opportunities for Australian workers and Australian businesses.</span>

The TPP will eliminate more than 98 per cent of tariffs between the parties to the agreement and will deliver major new opportunities for Australian exporters, clearly including those in Tasmania. In fact, in 2017, Tasmania's exports of goods to TPP countries were valued at $910.7 million, a rise of almost 10 per cent on the 2016 number. Senator Abetz and his Tasmanian colleagues have long argued for new trade opportunities for Tasmanian beef, seafood, wine and cheese. The TPP will achieve just that, including accelerated reductions in Japan's import tariffs on beef. The TPP will go even further than our FTA with Japan and include the elimination of beef tariffs in both Canada and Mexico within 10 years of entry into force and the elimination of all tariffs on seafood, horticultural and manufactured goods.</span>

One in five Australians has a job that relies on trade, and exports accounted for more than 21 per cent of our GDP growth last year. This growth was driven by our breakthrough agreements with China, Japan and Korea, which are actually delivering local jobs and creating new growth opportunities for Australian businesses. The signing of the TPP-11 is a major win for exporters and it sends a message to the world that prosperity is achieved through breaking down trade barriers and not through building them.</span>

Will the Prime Minister be telling the pensioners he meets with that he has cut $1 billion from pensioner concessions and axed the $900 seniors supplement to self-funded retirees receiving the Commonwealth seniors health card? How many pensioners in Cowper are worse off as a result of the government's changes to the pension assets test that came into effect on 1 January last year?</span>

                  </a>  Australia has exported to China annually around 60,000 tonnes of papers and plastics collected through household recycling bins, but now this material is piling up around Australia. Big recyclers like Visy are refusing to take waste. Local government organisations are officially calling it a crisis. All industry stakeholders are calling for federal intervention. Given that China lodged notice with the WTO well in advance, what steps did the federal government take to pass on this information to state and local governments? What actions did you take to prepare for the recycling crisis that is now happening?</span>

I'm advised that when China first announced its restrictions, on 18 July 2017, the Australian government, through DFAT officials, immediately contacted several industry groups in the state and territory governments to inform them. Since that time, the Australian government has raised this matter with China on several occasions. Indeed, senior levels of government have engaged with China to request that the amendments be reviewed or delayed, including through representations by the embassy in Beijing and to the World Trade Organization. I am further advised that in December of 2017 the secretary of the department met with China's Vice-Minister of Environmental Protection, who provided a rationale for the restrictions but confirmed China's intent to implement the regulatory changes in the time frames notified to the WTO. Both Minister Ciobo and Minister Frydenberg wrote to China's Minister of Environmental Protection in 2017 noting Australia's concerns in relation to this matter and advising them Australia was closely monitoring China's implementation of the amendments. I am further advised that the department continues to work with DFAT and the states and territories to determine how the change will impact the domestic waste and scrap industries.</span>

Given there have been industry-wide calls for federal intervention into this recycling process over the last eight months, with business groups like the Waste Management Association of Australia saying that it's simply too important an industry to continue to say it's all up to the states, what action is the federal government now taking to show leadership to stop and manage the meltdown?

We acknowledge that this is a critically important issue for Australia, and the Australian government is identifying where Commonwealth intervention can best support states and territories in their responses, both over the short and longer terms. I've already outlined the extensive representations that Australia has made in relation to our engagement with China over this issue, and those representations and that work continue. I would also note that Australia exports recyclable materials to over 100 countries, and preliminary analysis indicates that about 70 per cent of that waste, by volume, exported from Australia in categories affected by China's waste import restrictions has indeed been sent to other nations such as Vietnam, Indonesia, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan, the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong and Bangladesh.</span>

That is acknowledged by the industry and local government. Industry has said that if the government had implemented just two of the 16 policies agreed by COAG under the national waste plan, we wouldn't be in this crisis—that's a federal responsibility. Will you commit to acting on the National Waste Policy, a policy that will invest in more jobs, less pollution and provide a genuine long-term solution to the recycling crisis?</span>

Senator O'Sullivan, the whole coalition team are focused on delivering secure jobs and greater opportunities for everyone who calls regional Australia home. One of the key planks in the coalition's job-creating agenda is the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages. Through RJIP, the coalition is partnering with other levels of government and the private sector to deliver job-creating projects in regional Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Wide Bay and the Bowen Basin, the coalition will support 29 projects with almost $50 million worth of Commonwealth funding. Importantly, we are levering another $100 million, so there is $150 million worth of jobs going into this area. We are supporting projects like the Wallaville cane railway expansion via the Isis Central Sugar Mill. We're contributing $2.5 million to build 36 kilometres of new railway track, which will create more than 40 new jobs at the mill. In Yeppoon we are supporting the new $11.6 million fruit-processing plant being delivered by Tropical Pines. This new plant will give local growers more opportunities to ensure that their fruit is able to be processed when it's fresh and at its best and, importantly, will create another 25 jobs when it's operational. In Gladstone, we're getting behind the Gladstone Regional Council to deliver the community health precinct on Philip Street. This precinct will help bring health and social services together in a one-stop shop that will provide better outcomes for the local community and ultimately employ more than 250 people in different roles. All up, the 29 projects supported across Wide Bay and the Bowen Basin are expected to create more than 800 jobs during construction and 1,500 ongoing jobs when they're complete. This is the kind of support from the coalition for the Australian economy that delivered over 400,000 jobs in the last year. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We're committed to reducing the company tax rate to 25 per cent for all Australian businesses to ensure that we remain competitive around the world and continue to drive local investment and local job creation. We're also supporting job-creating projects like the Rookwood Weir, which will provide a huge boost to Central Queensland. We've been urging the Queensland Labor Party to join us in supporting the job outcomes from the Rockwood Weir, so those on the other side can have a crack; that'd be really handy. We want them to deliver the business case and deliver this vital piece of infrastructure. Of course, we support the Carmichael mine—the thousands of jobs that it will bring to Central Queensland. These are real jobs. Already Adani is employing about 800 people, contributing $7.2 million worth of wages every month. Each and every one of those jobs means an income, a livelihood and a better standard of living for Australian families. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The opposition might parrot the lines 'regional jobs for regional Queensland' but the coalition is the only party that has actually delivered jobs and is delivering jobs now for regional Queensland. The opposition has absolutely no credibility when it comes to regional jobs. Regional Australians are tired of the opposition leader's fake gestures and tired lines. They have told us they can see right through this bloke. He is laying the groundwork to walk slowly away from projects like the Carmichael mine and the 10,000 jobs it will create for Central Queensland. The opposition leader should explain why keeping his job is far more important to him than creating jobs for regional Australians who are desperate for a secure future for themselves and their families. We're delivering more, better-paid jobs for Central Queensland, and I know Queensland is lucky to have candidates like Senator O'Sullivan and Senator Canavan. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I refer to documents released to me under FOI on Monday, two days after the South Australian state election, that revealed that your department contracted ASC in June 2016 to undertake a study for the relocation of Collins submarine full-cycle docking, work that involves 700 direct jobs and thousands of indirect jobs from South Australia to Western Australia. Is it not the case that ASC's Adelaide based full-cycle docking work has been applauded by Minister Pyne as 'remarkable and exemplary'? Is it not the case that, following inquiries to your office by <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Advertiser</span> in August 2016, ASC was directed to suspend the study because of what the department described as 'current sensitivity'? What was that sensitivity, and was it political?</span>

It is certainly the case that the work of ASC in South Australia in terms of the work they are doing in sustainment of the Collins class submarines is remarkable and exemplary. I absolutely agree with my very good friend and colleague Minister Pyne. What is actually much more interesting is some of the early writings of Senator Patrick in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Asia </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Pacific Defence Reporter</span>. The government will make decisions about the location of the Collins class and the future submarines sustainment, including full-cycle docking, in due course.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I would note, in passing—or 'en passant', if we want to talk about matters French and submarines—that Senator Patrick has a completely different view. Let me quote: 'Finally, the sustainment operations must be moved to Western Australia, where the submarine force operates from. And if and when we have submarines home based in the east—Sydney or Newcastle—supporting submarine sustainment out of the Adelaide site, 2,600 kilometres from where the submarine force operates, isn't smart. It is disruptive to the crews, time consuming, costly to the Navy and against the recommendations of Cole, who found that ASC in the west was much more outcome focused.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Frankly, what I have said sets out the approach that the government would take in relation to sustainment. There are a range of issues: how we would meet our operational requirements and how we would get the best capability outcomes. But, ultimately, the reality of the government's decision to double the size of our future submarine fleet, as well as to design and to build our future submarines domestically, means the size of the submarine workforce in Australia, in Adelaide, will need to increase dramatically—dramatically. And the senator is well aware of that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, as we know, the future submarine program is expected to create an annual average of around 2,800 jobs in Australia, even before we consider the sustainment needs of the fleet that will transition between two classes and that will double in size.

You might have held the view that you had when you wrote in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Asia-Pacific Defence Reporter</span> that it should definitely be moved. You might have held that view. You might hold that view now. Perhaps you are just choosing a different position on a different day of the week.

Yesterday she announced an additional $3.4 million in humanitarian assistance, which will bring our total earthquake response to $5 million. This includes $3 million for Australian and PNG non-government organisations that are active in the Highlands region to support recovery in sectors like agriculture and health. As part of our package, we are also providing support to vulnerable women and children in the affected areas. We're also assisting with electrical transformers to re-establish reliable power supplies in the affected provinces. There are humanitarian supplies, and an AUSMAT, an Australian medical assistance team, is assisting with the coordination of help to the affected areas. I also commend the work that the Australian Defence Force have done. They have played a vital role, as they always do, by helping to transport over 300 tonnes of Australian and partner humanitarian supplies we have deployed. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It caused serious casualties and extensive damage. We are responding to calls by the Tongan government for assistance, including with crisis response teams and, again, the Australian Defence Force, with a total response of $3.5 million. The foreign minister and I will visit Tonga later this week to see firsthand the damage that has been caused, to meet some of the families, to meet some of the Australian volunteers who have been working there, and to see what further assistance the government may need in responding to this crisis. The assistance that we've given has included life-saving equipment, emergency shelter, and kitchen and hygiene kits that have helped to assist over 2,000 people in need.</span>

The Australian Chronic Disease Prevention Alliance members include Diabetes Australia, Cancer Council Australia, Kidney Health Australia, the National Heart Foundation and the Stroke Foundation. The government has been pleased to fund members of the alliance, which are respected, trusted organisations in the Australian community, to deliver a range of valuable preventative health activities over the past few years.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The funding has included $660,000 over the last three years to the Stroke Foundation to review and update the clinical guidelines for stroke management, which will help doctors better ensure outcomes for Australians who are unfortunate enough to suffer from a stroke; $55.6 million to Diabetes Australia in the last financial year to implement the National Diabetes Services Scheme, a scheme that is helping all Australians afflicted with diabetes to get the supplies they need to manage this potentially debilitating condition; and $730,000 to Cancer Council Australia to revise guidelines to assist doctors to detect bowel cancer early, to manage cancer when it occurs and to provide advice to patients on how to reduce the risk of bowel cancer. This work is done by our world-leading experts, helping us to reduce the incidence and impact of this common cancer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The research is clear. Chronic conditions can be best addressed by reducing the prevalence and impact of health risk factors such as physical inactivity, unhealthy weight gain, smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. The government acknowledges that chronic conditions impact heavily on the community, families and individuals, but according to the 2014-15 National Health Survey it's estimated that 63.4 per cent of Australians aged 18 years and over are overweight or obese. That is why we support a range of issues and tangible initiatives in the community to reduce those health risk factors.</span>

I can inform the senator that currently there is no empirical evidence from any country that indicates obesity rates have declined due to the implementation of a sugar-sweetened beverages tax. Obesity, as we know, is often caused by poor diet choices, physical inactivity and a range of other factors that are often interrelated. As such, obesity prevention and nutrition promotion requires a multifactorial approach, and this government is delivering on a range of tangible programs, such as the Healthy Food Partnership and Sporting Schools initiative, to assist in this area.</span>

However, a recent study that was in fact funded by those organisations who financed the campaign for a sugar tax admitted that causality cannot be established between the sugar tax and reduced rates of obesity. We will support evidence based policy decisions.</span>

Note to Senator Leyonhjelm: I know you would like to get rid of the 10 per cent GST on the chairs; that will remain post budget. Senator Di Natale, the only party in the Senate that supports a sugar tax is the Greens. If you look at the Greens' electoral fortunes over the recent past, it will show they are in decline. Clearly Australians don't support the Greens and their support for a sugar tax. I can absolutely commit to the Senate and to Senator Leyonhjelm we will not be introducing a sugar tax.</span>

You plan to double-tax pensioners and retirees in a bid to bail your leader out of a budget black hole that he cannot pay for. But guess what? There are exemptions. And despite taking money off pensioners and retirees, he is exempting union slush funds connected with the CFMEU and other Labor-aligned bodies. This means that groups associated with big unions will continue to receive franking credit refunds but many pensioners and retirees won't.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's latest tax grab does not target wealthy retirees. More than half of all refunded franking credits are paid to individuals who earn less than the $18,200 tax-free threshold, including pensioners and self-funded retirees. Ninety-seven per cent of people who receive franking credit refunds have a taxable income below $87,000—people who have worked hard, saved hard and paid tax.</span>

This will hurt 230,000 pensioners. I was about to tell you where those 230,000 pensioners are who are earning less than $18,000: in New South Wales, 210,000; in Victoria, 150,000; in Western Australia, 50,000; in Queensland, 110,000; in South Australia, 45,000; and, in Tasmania, 15,000. These figures show that these people will learn a lot less as a consequence of your $60 billion tax grab that's going to hit pensioners and retirees.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:03</span>):  I was asked a question yesterday by Senator Wong with respect to the contract for cleaning services at Parliament House—whether it had been awarded and whether I could advise the Senate of the details of the company involved and payment. I have sought advice from the Department of Parliamentary Services and I can provide the following information. The new contract for cleaning services at Parliament House has yet to be awarded. The Department of Parliamentary Services expects to finalise the tender evaluation process within the next two weeks. Following this, a period of negotiation with the preferred tenderer will commence. The successful tenderer must comply with all government legislation, including the Fair Work Act 2009. At this stage it is too early to make judgements regarding wage rates for cleaners. Senators should rest assured that the tender and contract are being managed within the Commonwealth Procurement Rules. The Department of Parliamentary Services anticipates the process will be concluded by the end of April.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Jobs and Innovation (Senator Cash) to a question without notice asked by Senator Cameron today relating to the annual wage review undertaken by the Fair Work Commission.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I had the fortune to listen to the secretary of the ACTU, Sally McManus, and the misfortune to listen to the discredited Minister Cash, an absolutely discredited minister, a minister who should do the right thing and simply resign from the frontbench. This is a minister who presided over an absolute mess in her previous portfolios. This is a minister who does not care about the wages, conditions and rights of ordinary working families in this country. This is a minister who sets out constantly to attack working people, attack workers' wages and attack penalty rates. It's an outrageous position supported by every one of the rabble that sits across this place—every one of them. It is an absolute rabble of a government, a government who would rather give $65 billion worth of tax cuts to their mates in the banks than look after the penalty rates and the working conditions of ordinary workers in this country. They are an absolute disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just these sorts of attacks that we see taking place; we also see this government and this discredited Minister Cash using her agencies to attack the trade union movement and to run political attacks on her political opponents. We have seen that happen constantly with this minister. The other night I saw a BBC <span style="font-style:italic;">Panorama </span>program called <span style="font-style:italic;">Taking on Putin</span>. The BBC reporter was John Sweeney. He was showing the use by the Putin government of government agencies to attack their political opponents. Well, what you see here with Minister Cash is the agency that she set up, the ROC, being used to attack her political opponents. We also see the Fair Work Ombudsman and the ABCC being used to attack her political opponents. This government would sit nicely with the Putin administration in the USSR. They would be lovely there with the Russians, because they would fit in nicely. Using government agencies to attack your political opponents is just outrageous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Cash is completely discredited due to her failure to deal with any of the questions that were asked of her today. We asked her whether she would make a submission to the Fair Work Commission to defend workers in the hair and beauty industry who rely on penalty rates. She just wouldn't answer the question. She wouldn't answer the question, because she's not capable of answering the question or to have a submission prepared to actually support workers that are doing it tough. Yet we've got these organisations going in arguing for cutbacks to workers' wages, workers' penalty rates and workers' conditions, supported by this rabble of a government that is on its last legs. It is a decaying, dying government with a weak Prime Minister and ministers in this place that would use agencies to attack working people and working people's wages and conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an outrageous proposition that a minister can't come in here and be honest and accurate in terms of the questions asked. She was asked again: 'Is the government's only plan to help struggling Australian workers this $65 billion tax cut?' They are relying on trickle-down economics that haven't worked anywhere else in the world. We heard the report from the President about the cleaners in this place, who do a great job and who deserve decent rates of pay and decent conditions. What was one of this government's first acts? To cut the wages of some of the lowest paid people in this place: the cleaners. They cut the wages of the cleaners—and I bet they'll do it again, because they don't care about workers, they don't care about the rights of workers and they don't care about workers' living standards. They are a disgrace. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="YW4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:09</span>):  This is what you can expect from Senator Cameron, with that diatribe of misinformation, accusations and political attacks against one of the most successful ministers this parliament has seen for a long time, who just happens to be a woman. It's interesting with Senator Cameron and a couple of other Labor senators that the vicious political attacks always seem to be on successful women ministers such as Senator Cash, Senator Payne and Senator Fierravanti-Wells. I just wonder why that is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cash doesn't need me to defend or protect her. She's more than capable of doing that, and she has done that against vicious personal attacks by the likes of Senator Cameron over many, many months now. Why are Senator Cameron and the union movement so determined to attack Senator Cash and try to bring her down? It's because they know she is successful at her job, she understands the portfolio brilliantly and she can identify the rorts and rabble that pass as the union movement in Australia at the moment. No wonder only nine per cent of workers in the private industry in Australia choose to belong to a union movement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to ask Senator Cameron—and also Senator Ketter, who I see here but who I might say takes a much more reasonable approach to policy debate—to explain to us how the superannuation industry is going to deal with Labor's policy on slashing the income of lower paid pensioners and older people with their dividend imputation approach? Both of those senators that I mentioned have been directors of large superannuation companies. I'm not quite sure of Senator Ketter's case, but I know in Senator Cameron's case as the director of one of Australia's biggest superannuation funds he was dragging in a salary of $150,000. He should understand just what the impact will be of Labor's policies on the superannuation holdings of people on very, very limited income. I challenge Senator Cameron to actually explain to this parliament just what impact the Australian Labor Party's policy will have on retirees and pensioners if their imputation policy goes ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to quickly turn to the penalty rates that were the subject of the question and of Senator Cameron's diatribe. In passing, I say it is typical of Senator Cameron to accuse the government of doing something with cleaners' wages. He knows we all love the cleaners. As the President explained just previously, this is an independent process, quite removed from the government, and no decision's yet been made. Yet that doesn't stop Senator Cameron making these false and vile accusations on behalf of a group who we all love.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On penalty rates, I just reiterate again what Senator Cash said so well in answers given in question time. These penalty rates are determined by the Fair Work Commission. Who set up the Fair Work Commission? It was the Australian Labor Party in government and, in particular, Mr Bill Shorten. Who made the decisions on penalty rates? It was that Fair Work Commission set up by the Labor Party, the chairman and most of the members of which were appointed by the Australian Labor Party in government. I make no comment about that. I think they carefully looked at the issues and came to the decision. But it wasn't a government decision. In spite of Senator Cameron continually misinforming the parliament and anyone who might be listening to this debate about that fact, those decisions on penalty rates were made by the Labor set up and appointed Fair Work Commission, the independent umpire that Labor at one stage used to support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to talk about penalty rates, just have a look at the example Senator Cash gave about Mr Bill Shorten in his time as a union leader in giving away the penalty rates of lower paid workers. Senator Cameron should understand the truth of these matters. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  I rise today to also take note of the answers given by our Minister for Jobs and Innovation, Senator Cash, to Senator Cameron's question on the unwillingness of the government, and indeed Senator Cash's own role, in being prepared to protect the penalty rates of Australian workers, specifically hair and beauty workers across our country. I must say, despite Senator Cash's impressive attempts to try and avoid answering these targeted questions, her message was, nevertheless, fairly clear. It is clear this government will not stand up for the 85,000 workers in the beauty industry who are at risk of losing their penalty rates, after the hair and beauty employers made their submission to the Fair Work Commission this week. They have called for cuts to the penalty rates of workers in this industry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's answers show us that this government is simply not prepared to stand up for these workers. These workers are not well paid, as anyone who talks to their hairdresser knows. I have to say I certainly hope that Senator Cash does not get her hair or her nails done on a weekend, because she doesn't think her hairdresser deserves to be paid for working on the weekend. No-one should have to put up with that. These 84,000 workers now join an ever-growing number of workers who are at risk of losing their penalty rates—penalty rates on which they very much depend to make ends meet week after week. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that last July penalty rate cuts kicked in for 700,000 workers in the retail, hospitality, fast food and pharmacy sectors. Is it any coincidence that wage growth is stagnating in this country? You only need to look at these kinds of figures to see where wages in this country are going. It seems to me that it's likely that this government wants to see hair and beauty workers be next. Who after that? We know, importantly, that aged-care workers are specifically also very worried about their penalty rates. We know that cost of living is rising and wage growth has hit record lows, but we continue to see these attacks on the wages of workers. It's all very well for those opposite to talk about their trickle-down economics of company tax cuts. The simple fact is: why can't you stand up for the penalty rates of workers who work on the weekends for some of these very big corporations? Your failure to do so shows me very clearly that I don't have any confidence in your expectation, your argument, that company tax cuts will eventually benefit workers. Under this government, we see life just getting harder and harder for ordinary Australians. When will you stand up and support these workers? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other hand, we are steadfastly clear in our opposition to penalty rate cuts. We want to see this parliament legislate on this question. Those opposite have done nothing to stand up to this issue. Penalty rates are not a luxury for workers in our country. Millions of Australians and their families rely on them every day. However, we have a Prime Minister that is too busy looking after the big end of town, looking after his friends in the top tax brackets, giving millionaires more than $16,000 a year in tax cuts and handing out tax cuts to big business while taking away from hardworking, low-paid Australians. It is absolutely deplorable that this government fails to stand up to protect Australian workers, and Minister Cash's answer shows this. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DYU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAWCETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  I too rise to take note of the answers given. I want to start off by reflecting on the fact that penalty rates are based on a wage, the wage that is set and the percentages on top of that, but the starting point, surely, therefore is that you have to have a job in order to have a wage. One of the things that is really important for this chamber to remember, as we debate, this week, legislation looking at the implementation of some of the government's policies, is that the government's policies, in terms of engaging and encouraging business to create jobs and to invest in their workplaces, have been working.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the start of this year, we were able to reflect on 2017 and see that the government's policies had set the environment where jobs growth across the nation was over 403,000, the majority—around three-quarters—of which were full-time jobs. In December alone, some 34,700 jobs were created. Contrast that with those opposite in their last year of government. They created only 89,000 jobs. Well, they didn't create them, but their policies put a lid on business's willingness to invest in their workforce and their workplaces such that only 89,000 jobs were created, and the majority of those were part time. Under this government's policy settings, the confidence of business has been such that they are employing, and the participation rate is now the highest it's been in seven years. In fact, since September 2013, over 950,000 jobs have been created. I think back to the promise made by then-Prime Minister Abbott of the target of the coalition in terms of jobs, and we're getting pretty close to the target he set in terms of the number of jobs created.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The starting point, when we talk about people working and receiving a wage or penalty rates, is that they need jobs. As people in this chamber consider whether or not they will support government policies, they should keep in mind what we have achieved since 2013, what we achieved just last year and what we achieved in the last month of last year and compare that to the policies and approaches of those opposite and the outcomes for Australia. What is important, if we're going to create jobs, is that businesses are competitive, and they need to be competitive for two things: they need to be competitive for capital—for the ability to attract funds to invest in the business, to recapitalise, to grow, to create opportunity and to pay more to attract workers to their business—and they need to be competitive for customers. If businesses price themselves out of the market, customers will go elsewhere, and we see that in Australia. We see that in the restaurant trade, for example, when businesses can't open on the weekend necessarily because they are not making money, when business owners can't employ staff and run the businesses themselves and when customers say, 'The prices are too high; we don't like the surcharges you're having to put on to cover penalty rates,' and choose to go elsewhere. So businesses need to be competitive, and that brings us back to things like the taxation policy that we are debating at the moment, which is going to be good for Australians because it creates the investment and it creates the opportunities for businesses to grow more jobs, to give people that starting point and to pay them more. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the penalty rates discussion, it's important to understand that the Fair Work Commission is there to provide independent arbitration around getting the balance right between the needs of workers and the needs of businesses in the economy at the time. People listening to this debate, when they hear the Labor Party going on about this, should remember that it was the Labor Party who set up the Fair Work Commission. It's the Labor Party who didn't object to rulings of the Fair Work Commission at times in the past but are objecting now because it's politically opportune for them to do so. If they were consistent—and we had members opposite in this debate today talk about the fast food industry—they would look at some of the outcomes that have been delivered for workers in the fast food industry as a result of agreements that were negotiated by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten. This government is the government that is creating opportunity, jobs and, eventually, higher wages for people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  I too rise to take note of Minister Cash's answer to the question from Senator Cameron during question time. It was a pretty straightforward question, and it may surprise listeners that it's not unusual for a government to take a position in a case before the industrial relations commission. It's not unusual for a government to put a position in respect of a minimum wage outcome or a significant change. The question went to the heart of the matter: what is this government going to say to the Fair Work Commission? And the resounding answer was: nothing. This government is not going to step up and even have a view about this matter. If you'd listened to the three contributions to this debate from the other side—or was it two contributions?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator GALLACHER:</span>
                  </a>  Only two—you nearly got me; there were only two. I thought they were good enough for three, they were that misleading. The independence of the Fair Work Commission was raised in both contributions. Let's have a look at the independence of it. The last three appointees have been described by employers as 'bringing it back to balance'. There have been quite a number of appointees to the Fair Work Commission since 2016-17, and really all of those appointees have moved it away from the old-fashioned principle of balance—one representative from the employer side and one from the union side. Increasingly now, we see the appointments all being swung towards the employer side of representation, with people from the Farmers' Federation, ACCI and the like. There's a place for those people in that august organisation, but there should be some balance. Workers should be able to go to the Fair Work Commission, present their case and expect to be heard in a fair and just manner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Fawcett made the comment, 'We've created lots of jobs.' What unions do—and it may surprise him—is create better jobs out of those fundamental jobs. They create better jobs. They set a span of hours within which you can work your eight hours, and, if you've worked eight hours and you do another two, you get time and a half. Then, if you do any more time after 10 hours, you get double time. Surprise, surprise—after 10 hours work you get a little kick along to encourage you to keep putting your shoulder to the wheel in that job. By necessity, a lot of the jobs in the economy are not all that invigorating. They're hard-work jobs and there needs to be a penalty rate to get people to work beyond the ordinary hours. Heaven forbid, if people have to work on a Saturday or Saturday night, that they might get time and a half! They might even get into double time if they're lucky. On one day of the week, Sunday, they get double time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do know people who own and operate restaurants. One said to me, 'Alex, it's too expensive to bring in the kitchen hand on a Sunday.' I said, 'So what do you do?' He said, 'We don't open.' I said, 'Well, you've made a business decision. That's your business decision, but I can go into Darling Harbour on a Sunday night and there will be 10,000 people waiting to get a feed. So you made that decision in one part of the country; in other parts of the country they don't necessarily make that decision.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Penalty rates are not the root of all evil. Penalty rates are the way that decent, hardworking Australian workers—whether they are members of a union or not—students, backpackers and the like go about sustaining themselves. They don't go around banking bloody $300 or $400 a week. The penalty rates are what pay the electricity, the rent and the going out, if they're fortunate enough to be able to do that. They sustain their necessities of life. If penalty rates are not there, it means that people will get less take-home pay. There will be less to share in families who are not doing very well. Cutting penalty rates is a ferocious attack on the lowest earners in the community, the people who are not at the top. As Keating always said, we've always got to be on the side of the angels—on the side of those who need a leg-up—not on the side of people in positions of privilege, where most of those on the other side come from, including Senator McGrath, who is grinning away. My bet is he's never worked a day in his life. He never, ever had to work for penalty rates or meal money, or worked past nine o'clock on a Saturday night or got up at five o'clock in the morning to earn some penalties.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right around this country there's a tsunami of anger coming towards this federal government over the current crisis in recycling not just in New South Wales and Victoria, which has been well publicised, but in other states. One thing Australians know how to do is recycle. When you talk to people about being green, one of the first things they try to talk to you about is solar panels or renewable energy; another thing they try to talk to you about is recycling. Over decades, Australians have learnt to recycle through kerbside recycling. We put our household recyclable goods in a small bin, and then it goes into a yellow wheelie bin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians around this country will realise that decades of kerbside recycling are now at risk and in total crisis, facing a complete meltdown and collapse, because this federal government has been asleep at the wheel on its federal waste policy. It admitted in the Senate today that it knew mid last year that the Chinese government was going to stop buying low-grade Australian waste. Sixty per cent of our low-grade waste is exported to China. We've relied on these exports to run our kerbside recycling industry. But China were making really clear statements that they were going to change the specifications around those exports. We didn't invest in local recycling options, and now we've got a situation where China is not going to take our waste anymore. We've got no way of cleaning the waste so that it meets their specifications. Right around the country local governments in Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia and even Tasmania are facing a crisis where the transport companies are threatening to not even pick up kerbside recycling from your house, and the recyclers aren't accepting recyclable materials because they can't sell them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unless it's properly sorted and sifted and there is a process around investing in the infrastructure that's needed to make recycling properly sustainable in this country, then there's going to be a massive tsunami of electoral backlash. I can tell you why. Australians mostly pay their rates to their councils. Those rates go towards paying for the cost of the transportation of that kerbside collection and other costs associated with it. Then councils have to pay levies in every state—except Queensland, at this stage—and those levies are actually paid for by council ratepayers. They are going to be furious when they realise that, after decades of paying their rates in the expectation that what they put in their wheelie bin will actually get recycled, it is not going to happen. It is not going to happen because of a combined failure of leadership by the federal and state governments. Those ratepayers are going to be really, really annoyed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're at a crossroads in this situation. We can either turn towards crisis and a complete meltdown of decades of recycling in this country or turn towards the opportunity to invest in jobs and in new industry so that we can be resilient and self-reliant in the processing of our waste.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government has sat on a plan, the National Waste Policy, since it was elected and has not done a thing to meet its responsibilities in relation to waste management. This plan was put in place in 2009. Out of 16 key policies, only one has actually been brought into law here: the Product Stewardship Act. And what has happened to that? Its funding has been cut, it has barely been used and now it's up for review. The federal government has a very important role to play in national waste policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm chairing the Senate inquiry into this recycling crisis at the moment. I have never before seen industry stakeholders, every single one of them—from environment groups, local government associations, councillors, industry, transport companies, recyclers, exporters and reprocessors—singing from the same song sheet: 'We want the federal government to enact the National Waste Policy, the policies that would actually make recycling sustainable in this country.' That's going to require investment and it's going to require leadership. Mr Frydenberg has made it really clear he doesn't believe this is a federal government issue. Waste and waste management, and of course the waste that makes its way the to the ocean—one of the biggest pollution issues we are facing on the planet at the moment—are everyone's problems, and the government has a really important role to play here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be following this up. If anybody is free and available this afternoon, at 5.30 in 2S3 we'll be talking to the federal environment department about their lack of action on this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Question agreed to.</span>

                  </a>  The Australian government is aware of strong community interest concerning food labelling, particularly the use and labelling of palm oil as an ingredient in food products. The Australia and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation is responsible for food-labelling decisions and not the Commonwealth. In 2011, an independent panel undertook a review of food-labelling law and policy. From this, the forum agreed to a framework to guide its decision-making. The government considers that, where appropriate, industry should self-regulate in response to community demand. The forum has agreed that further work must be done before a decision can be made on mandatory labelling of palm oil. The government is committed to ensuring we achieve the appropriate balance between consumer and industry demand.</span>

                  </a>  The Australian government acknowledges the challenge of violent crime in South Africa, and our concerns are reflected in the official travel advice. The Australian government has also urged the South African government to ensure the safety and security of all of its citizens and, further, has also made our concerns in relation to land reforms known to them. Australia's humanitarian visa entry program is open to any applicant who believes they are facing persecution, with all such claims assessed on their merits.

                  </a>  The opposition notes the concerns held in the community about the protection of democratic rights and freedoms in South Africa, as reflected in motions from Senators Leyonhjelm and Anning before the Senate today. The opposition also notes the apparent conflict of views within the Turnbull government, in particular between the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, about Australia's response. The opposition considers it extraordinary that the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection should have injected himself so blatantly into what is a domestic political issue in the Republic of South Africa, particularly given the sensitivity with which President Ramaphosa is handling the matter of land reform. The opposition calls on the Prime Minister to clarify the government's position. Australia's non-discriminatory migration program has been in place for decades and is now an important part of contributing to Australia's vibrant multicultural community. If people are facing persecution, regardless of where they are from or the colour of their skin, they are able to apply for Australia's humanitarian visa program, which application will be assessed on its merits.</span>

                  </a>  The coalition government does not support Labor's retiree tax, which will take money out of the pockets of one million Australians, including 230,000 pensioners. Labor's policy will overwhelmingly hit low- and middle-income earners, with 86 per cent of the individuals impacted on taxable incomes of less than $37,000. The coalition government notes the importance of the franking credit in the Australian taxation system. Franking credits represent taxes that have already been paid on behalf of shareholders.</span>

                  </a>  Here we see the Liberal-Green alliance in action. We're just about to see it here. Federal Labor are absolutely committed to progressive taxation reform, including reform to dividend imputation, but it's disappointing that the Greens have taken two positions on this. After Labor's announcement, the Greens shadow spokesperson for finance, Sarah Hanson-Young, was out of the blocks early backing Labor's policy in; yet a couple of days later, hours before a certain by-election, we heard from the Leader of the Australian Greens, Senator Di Natale, who said the Greens do have concerns about this policy. Hours before the by-election—so desperate were they to rescue their failing campaign—that was what they resorted to: selling out their principles and selling out their shadow spokesperson. That was what we saw from Senator Di Natale hours before polling day. This mob aren't a patch on the Bob Brown Greens from a decade ago. They are selling out their principles and they were sold short in Batman.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  We should remember the Port Arthur massacre—35 people killed, 23 people wounded. Right now the National Firearms Agreement, a very significant development that came out of that absolute tragedy, is under threat. There is some good news. The three pillars that that agreement was based on are still in place. Those three pillars are that anyone seeking to own a gun must be licensed, each weapon must be registered and gun ownership remains a conditional privilege rather than a right.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we see happening, side by side with that, is incredible pressure being put on state and territory governments to weaken the gun laws, and this is coming from the firearms lobby. Some of the changes are really insidious. Most states now allow children to use firearms—to actually fire guns.</span>

                  </a>  I acknowledge the interjection. This is really shocking. We've seen the Nationals really out there, wanting to promote their commitment to the gun lobby—largely because their vote has been eroded by the firearms parties—and here they are, doing something really disgraceful: encouraging children to use arms on a regular basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also possible in this country for people to own more than 100 guns—in fact, hundreds and hundreds of guns. That, unfortunately, is one of the loopholes in the National Firearms Agreement that needs to be tidied up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's a particularly sinister aspect of the weakening of the National Firearms Agreement that came out on the eve of the Tasmanian election. Just days before that election, which returned the Liberals to power, it became known that, if elected, that party would soften the state's gun laws. The Liberals' proposed legislation would breach the National Firearms Agreement in a very extensive way. The period for gun licences is to be extended from five years to 10 years. When the National Firearms Agreement was debated extensively in 1996, they settled on five years for a very good reason—so that it could be reviewed to see if the person who held that licence should continue to hold it. Ten years is too long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remember the agreement is actually thanks to former Prime Minister Howard and the National Party former Deputy Prime Minister—which is something that the Nationals senators who sit in this place should remember—who literally put their lives on the line to go out in country areas and advocate for this agreement. And here we see the Nationals and the Liberals falling over themselves to now weaken it. From what I understand, their ideal is to actually remove it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal plan in Tasmania is also to permit farmers to have silencers on their semiautomatic rifles and shotguns, and to bring in a new category for prohibited firearms, category E—something that is very worrying. I've heard some people speculate that the firearm that Martin Bryant used for that absolutely horrendous massacre—some of the saddest stories that you could ever read—could again be available in Tasmania under this crazy plan that they've come forward with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for their tactic, this isn't something isolated to Tasmania. This is a tactic that the firearms lobby has in place: if they get the changes through in Tasmania, that becomes a springboard for other states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that there was a secret firearms consultation group—with no representation from the gun control lobby—with the Liberal government working very closely with those who advocate for firearms and often who make profits out of firearms. The reach of the gun lobby has come right into this parliament, with the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, considering establishing a committee to allow gun importers to review proposed changes to firearms regulations for 'appropriateness and intent'. There's no place, as I said, for gun control advocates in what they're bringing forward here. We also know that the firearms lobby are very generous donors to conservative parties—about half a million dollars has gone in—and that's something that my colleague Andrew Bartlett will expand on.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Friday, 23 March, in Sydney, there will be a rally outside Martin Place under the slogan 'Never again', where students, teachers, families and survivors will stand in support of and join students across America in the March for Our Lives, demanding an end to gun violence. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Rural Health, Minister for Sport, Minister for Regional Communications and Deputy Leader of The Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  I am a proud licensed firearm owner and also a senator. Senator Rhiannon, I agree that the tragedy of Port Arthur was exactly that and should never be allowed to happen again in this country. But to assume that licensed firearm owners are running around 20 years after the NFA was put in place, looking for schools, looking for opportunities to wreak crime and havoc on Australians, is an absolute joke. You stand up in this place and try to pretend that Australia is America and pretend that the NRA exists. The reality is that over a million Australians are law-abiding firearm owners who proudly protect their homes and property, hunt for food and are sporting shooters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got the Commonwealth Games coming up. We are some of the best shooters in the world, and as a nation we're very proud when we see that. Senator Rhiannon, you only grow Olympian athletes, including sporting shooters, if you allow them to develop the skill over time. You don't get to 25, pick up a shotgun and become a gold medallist. You have to have a junior firearm licence, an incredibly appropriate thing to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now in Victoria it's duck season. It is a lovely cultural experience for many families. They go away for the weekend. They set up their tents. They go camping with friends and family. They get up early in the morning and they go shooting their ducks, and many of those get their bagful. And I thank the state Labor government in Victoria for the work they've done to ensure duck season continues to be the strong tradition it is for so many in my home state. But you can't go out and camp as a family if your kids aren't allowed to come and if you can't train them in how to be safe and appropriate with firearms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our firearm laws are amongst the strongest in the world, and I can tell you, because I hold one, that obtaining a firearm licence is a very long and expensive process involving character checks and criminal history checks. You have to do safety training. There are restrictions on how the firearm can be used. You've got to have a recognised need to purchase the firearm. Then you have to open up the door to the police to let them come into your home and make sure you're storing your firearm and your ammunition appropriately. There are waiting periods not just to get your licence but if you want to purchase a firearm. Indeed, law-abiding gun owners would never risk their licence by owning an illegal gun.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tragedy of gun violence on the streets of Melbourne and Sydney and throughout Australia is not as a result of law-abiding firearm owners, and I absolutely guarantee that any changes that the state government in Tasmania are planning to make around how they register and regulate firearms in their state, as is their constitutional right, will not result in greater gun violence. I will tell you what will. What will result in greater gun violence is illicit and illegal firearms in the hands of criminals. And, Senator Rhiannon, that's why I suggest that, if you're really concerned about gun violence, instead of moving your meaningless MPI to make Batman voters feel a little better that you're standing up for them after the havoc that your particular factor wreaked in that by-election—I don't think it worked out too well for the Greens!—and instead of attacking the million law-abiding firearm owners in this country, you actually support the government legislation around cracking down on illicit firearms and on the trafficking of firearms. That's something tangible that you can actually do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, Labor Party senators, if you care about reducing gun violence, don't start attacking mums and dads who take their kids out to go hunting on the weekend, don't start attacking our Olympians and our Commonwealth Games athletes. Start supporting the government's legislation around illicit gun trafficking, because getting illegal guns in the hands of criminals is where the problem is. I can tell you that it's not the gun that actually kills people; it's the person behind it. I know there are some opposite who may not think that is a fact, but the Australian Institute of Criminology, in its National Homicide Monitoring Program annual report, indicated that 1.3 per 100,000 Australians remains the lowest-ever rate since records began in 1989-90. Knives and sharp objects remain the most common weapons used in homicides.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to the rhetoric and claims of the Greens, who are trying to make this an NRA style conversation here, we have strong firearm laws. They are appropriate. They are stringent. We don't want to see gun crime. We do not want to see people being hurt by guns. That is why we have to support legislative measures that will actually crack down on gun trafficking. So get on board with measures that will make a tangible difference to this issue rather than continuing with your critique of law-abiding firearm owners, who are absolute champions. I am looking forward to handing out the shooting medals at the Commonwealth Games in a couple of weeks. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This is why Peter Dutton needs to be pulled into line by the Prime Minister. For those in the chamber and those up in the gallery, I am a Tasmanian who remembers very vividly what happened at Port Arthur in 1996. You only had to walk the streets of any town or city in Tasmania and see written on the faces of those Tasmanians the tragedy, the hurt and the horrific scars that had been left on our communities to know that any change to, any softening of, the gun laws in this country will not be tolerated by the Australian people.</span>

Internationally, we are admired. We talk about what's been happening in America. You have students and parents marching to change things. I'm speaking as someone who was a licensed gun owner. I was. I was brought up in the country, so I knew how to shoot and to respect guns from a reasonably young age. But I turned my guns in and my husband relinquished his firearms as well because we believed that that was the right thing to do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now what we are seeing from these Liberals, both at a federal level and at a state level in my home state of Tasmania, are proposed changes to the gun laws. When did we find out about these changes by the Liberal state government? We heard nothing during the recent state election, but there was a leak to the media about secret meetings and the sneaky, underhand way that the Premier of that state had engaged with the gun lobby to make these changes. I have been inundated by people in Tasmania telling me they voted for the Hodgman government because they didn't know their proposal about changing the gun laws. That was sneaky, it was underhanded and it proves the Liberals cannot be trusted when it comes to gun laws in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are people who use guns for sport. We know that. But they have to respect the gun laws that we currently have in this country. There is no way that as a Tasmanian I'm going to sit in this chamber and listen to the nonsense that the Minister for Sport has put before this chamber to try to justify the changes that Dutton and Keenan have proposed. It is about time that the Prime Minister grew a backbone and put an end to this debate. We saw how weak he is when he defended Minister Cash with her outlandish attack on women in the Leader of the Opposition's office during the estimates process. So he needs some credibility and this is a good place to start. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just people like me who have concerns. I want to also remind people that a Port Arthur survivor, Peter Crosswell, has said about the proposed changes in Tasmania that our gun laws were 'the only good thing' to come out of the Port Arthur tragedy and disaster. The Alannah and Madeline Foundation, which was set up by Walter Mikac, whose wife and two daughters were killed in the massacre, has said that Mr Hodgman's proposed changes are 'a total betrayal of those lost'. That's a man who is still grieving for his wife and his two beautiful young daughters.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There isn't a Tasmanian who would've supported any change proposed by the Hodgman government if they had been aware of it. It was deceitful, it was dishonest and it proves yet again that the Liberals cannot be trusted. There were those who were negotiating behind closed doors, hoping like hell that no-one would find out before election day. We found out on the Friday. The next day was polling day. It was disgusting. I would have expected so much more from the Premier of the day—to be open and honest with Tasmanians. </span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />I support this motion, because I'm speaking from experience, as a Tasmanian, of the impact of guns. We know that domestic violence, no matter what Senator McKenzie says, is still a big issue, and guns are part of that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I rise to strongly support this motion. In doing so I strongly support the National Firearms Agreement, which, as senators would know, came about due to the tragedy in 1996 at Port Arthur in Tasmania where 35 innocent people were massacred. In doing so, I want to very strongly suggest to this Senate that the Tasmanian Liberals were caught out in the 48 hours before the most recent state election by secretly providing a policy to the gun lobby that proposed to effectively destroy the National Firearms Agreement—in Tasmania, of all places. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had Will Hodgman, the Premier of our state, who likes to portray himself as a moderate, a nice guy and a reasonable person, secretly providing a policy to the gun lobby in Tasmania—not to the broader Tasmanian people and the voters of Tasmania, but to a very narrowly targeted section of our community who want gun laws relaxed, who want to make it easier to obtain licences and who want to make it more difficult to control dangerous guns and weapons in our community. A policy that would destroy the National Firearms Agreement was provided secretly to them.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Indeed, the Tasmanian Liberals are looking at going back. They're looking at destroying the National Firearms Agreement, breaking the national consensus. What makes it even worse is they did it in a secretive way, they did it in a duplicitous way, they did it in a cowardly way and they did it in a way that shows how grossly out of touch Will Hodgman and the Tasmanian Liberals are with community sentiment on this issue in our state of Tasmania. They were caught out. The question for Will Hodgman now is: are you going to come forward and seek to legislate in the Tasmanian parliament to destroy the National Firearms Agreement? I tell you what my message to Will Hodgman is: don't you dare try this, because you will be the subject of a revolt from the Tasmanian people bigger than you've ever experienced before— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It occurs to me that we have strengthened our firearm laws and we have reduced gun violence. The basic aspect of this that occurs to me is that the Greens have brought this motion on, but they haven't supported the Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill. The Greens are saying, 'Strengthen firearms laws to reduce gun violence.' But if they were sincere about doing this then they would support our bill, which is about firearms trafficking and strengthening and refining firearms laws. The Greens are asking for something which occurred years ago and which will remain, certainly at the federal level. We must fight the scourge of illegal firearms trafficking; that's for sure. But it's not an issue of the need to strengthen our firearms laws to reduce gun violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like Senator McKenzie, I know guns. I've lived with guns all my life. Guns were part of my trade, as is the case for the police force, hunters, farmers and many people. I've seen the best and the worst of guns, and I've seen them in places where they impact on society to an appalling degree. However, guns do have value in the right hands, and they have value for the right reasons. As to those who are legally entitled to carry guns and who are trained to use guns, there is no point at all in making the actions of those people, or implying that they are, in any sense illegal. We have a first-class record in this country, as every speaker so far has agreed—the Howard government's reforms in 1996 and the National Firearms Agreement. I don't support any more relaxing of firearms laws. I would not have a gun in my house, not because I hate guns, but because I have no use for guns—I'm not a sporting shooter—nor would I now use guns or need guns in what I do for a living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have our own example in Australia of crimes that are committed with guns. We have had massacres in this country. We have criminal use of guns. In the US, of course, we see examples on a daily basis of activities in schools related to gun crime and massacres at concerts, in bars and other places. But this is not in any way, shape or form the United States. Senator McKenzie gave us the statistics for the use of guns in murders—1.3 per 100,000 Australians, with knives and sharp implements being the main method of creating havoc and causing injury. The ability of a gun to cause death and injury is quite marked. That's why, having seen activities where this has occurred, we have strengthened our gun laws, and it's why we maintain their strength. Of course other implements that we would use in the house—knives, axes or metal bars—are available, but the difference between them and guns is quite dramatic. There is a great deal of logic in having strong firearms laws, and we already have them. A desire to have even more is very interesting. I keep on asking myself where the justification is, outside pure virtue signalling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens proposal is to strengthen firearms laws but not to remove guns. The question that I have is: is this is a generality? Are we saying we're going to remove all firearms? Are we going to say we're still going to accept certain firearms? We've all seen the basis of the National Firearms Agreement: a licence for each weapon, registered for each purpose, and owning guns is a privilege. To remove them from the hands of those who have a legitimate reason to use them and who use them as a legitimate tool is just plain silly. And any move to remove even more guns from our society is going to cost us. I ask: how much are we prepared to pay? We have reduced the risk of the use of gun violence, except for the trafficking of guns by criminals, to a reasonable level, to a world-standard level. If there is a solid business case for doing it, I certainly can't see it. This is merely virtue signalling. We need to know if there is a business case. We need to know what the risk is all about, and we need to know what we're getting for the money that we may have to pay. Are we wasting our time debating something which is now already decided? We have strong gun laws.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Greens want to be taken seriously, I would encourage them to produce a business case, to refine what they're talking about. There could be a case that, if you irrationally tighten up laws on guns and you force those guns underground, you in fact make the situation a lot worse. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we need to do this with the states and territories, and we all remember how difficult a process that is. We already have a National Firearms Agreement, and that is working. What the firearms trafficking bill is trying to do is to address the illegal trafficking of firearms by tough, mandatory penalties, not tighten the conditions under which the legal use of guns operate. We all agree that penalties are a deterrent. Labor has agreed in the past that penalties are a deterrent, and that's certainly part of the bill. Mandatory sentences have a role in deterring crime, and society has a right to express its judgement on the seriousness of what they consider to be a crime. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have now brought this motion into the House. They've asked for it to be discussed. It would be very good if they were prepared to support the Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill. I finish by saying that if the Greens are serious about strengthening firearms laws in order to reduce gun violence then they will support the firearms trafficking bill. I make the point that the coalition can be trusted in relation to gun laws. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  Last Wednesday, tens of thousands of students walked out of schools across the United States. They did it in silence for 17 minutes—one minute for every victim of the Florida high school mass murder that had occurred exactly one month before. These children and families are joining the March For Our Lives movement. They will rally and take to the streets this Saturday in Washington DC to demand that their lives and safety become a priority and to demand that the United States ends the epidemic of mass shootings. Another school walkout is planned for 20 April, the 19th anniversary of Eric Harris's and Dylan Klebold's mass murder of their fellow students at Columbine High School in Colorado. Unfortunately, these students are walking out because they 'want to go to school without feeling afraid'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are countless other anniversaries of horrific mass shooting murders of schoolchildren in the United States. These students could observe those, like that of Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012, when 20 children in first grade and six teachers were shot dead. Australian children have not suffered the terror of a school shooting, and are, hopefully, unlikely to ever do so, thanks to then Prime Minister John Howard's '97 gun reforms. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 10 largest American gun manufacturers produce and sell more than eight million guns a year to US citizens. This is two-thirds of the US gun market, which is worth around $8 billion a year. The United States has a gun ownership rate seven times higher than Australia and a gun death rate that is 11 times higher. By virtue of the ease with which guns are accessible and the regularity with which they are used to kill US citizens, more than 1.5 million Americans have died in gun related incidents since 1968. According to Gun Violence Archive, 37,577 Americans were killed by a gun just last year. 732 were children and 3,234 were teenagers killed or injured with a gun. There were 346 mass shootings. The key statistics are increasing each year. This year alone, there have been 48 mass shootings in the United States, and we are only in March. 3,067 people who celebrated New Year's Eve in the United States have been shot dead by someone, and 140 children and 562 teenagers have been killed or injured this year. These statistics show very clearly that in the US gun violence has become part of their reality and that it occurs all too often. There has been one school shooting a week in the United States since 2013. Since that horrifying massacre in Florida, there have been four more school shootings. Just yesterday, there was another high school shooting in the United States, in the state of Maryland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During our Prime Minister's recent visit to the United States, at a joint press conference with President Trump, very shortly after the Florida massacre, Prime Minister Turnbull made a calculated decision to reject the example of Australia's laws and what they could set and provide. Australia's laws weren't an appropriate model for potential US gun control, the Prime Minister said, because the US has:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… a completely different context historically, legally and so forth. They are very different countries with very different sets of problems.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, on the contrary; I believe Australia has a valuable legacy to share. We suffered an average of one mass shooting per year in the decade to 1996. Then we faced the Port Arthur massacre, where one Sunday afternoon in my home state of Tasmania 35 people were killed by one man. In one of the most courageous Australian political acts in recent memory, the newly-elected Liberal Prime Minister, John Howard, with the support of Nationals leader Tim Fisher launched a buyback and tightened laws around access to firearms, particularly rifles and shotguns. Following those Port Arthur gun reforms, there have been no mass shootings in this country, no mass shootings in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our legacy is strong not only domestically but internationally as well. Australia is one of seven co-authors of the 2006 UN General Assembly resolution calling for an arms trade treaty to 'better regulate the conventional arms trade and to reduce the impact of armed violence on communities around the world'. The treaty entered into force on 24 December 2014. Australia has a record of action, achievement and safety that we should be offering to share internationally, but instead what are we doing? We're chipping away at it slyly by the actions of conservative governments run by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Premier Will Hodgman in Tasmania.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our shadow Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, pointed out last week that Home Affairs Minister Dutton—Australia's would-be chief policeman and high interrogator—insidiously wants to put gun lobbyists on an advisory committee to review government firearms policy without any balance from gun control advocates. The shadow Attorney-General rightly pointed out that Peter Dutton, talking about putting gun lobby people on his advisory committee or Michael Keenan talking about removing red tape in gun regulation, is all 'just code for weakening the gun laws, allowing more powerful guns to be imported'. Australia needs to reverse this weakening of gun laws. We actually need more gun control, not a weakening of John Howard's legacy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, on top of that, we've had Premier Will Hodgman's government sneakily unveiling a policy to water down our gun laws in Tasmania that was only revealed in the media the day before the Tasmanian election, after the Liberal Party released its policy privately to a consultation group. It was not published on the Liberal Party website prior to the recent election; it was hidden. They were so ashamed of it that, even though they were doing it, they hid it. It is horrific and frightening and will breach the National Firearms Agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Tim Fisher, who as Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the National Party was instrumental in helping John Howard make the case for Australia's strict gun control laws, this sort of NRA-type push by Dutton and Hodgman must be resisted—and, indeed, it must be. Last weekend, Mr Fisher said he was deeply concerned about the rise of NRA inspired lobbying and right-wing parties who are influencing pushback against our laws. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the core structure and content of the Howard gun reforms must not be done away with. Creep and corrosion of the core of the gun law reforms is a danger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed it is a danger. The only positive thing that survivor Peter Crosswell believes came out of the Port Arthur massacre was the change to Australia's gun laws. Paramedic Peter James can't believe that a responsible person would want to weaken our gun laws, especially in Tasmania. First responder Dr Brian Walpole feels betrayed and asked:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">How can you trust a government that does this, sort of sneakily, just before an election?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Walter Mikac, whose entire family was murdered at Port Arthur, feels Will Hodgman's proposed changes to the gun laws are a total betrayal of those lost. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's about people having the most basic human right of being able to go about their day to day life without the risk that they are going to get killed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to our gun laws, Australian citizens currently enjoy that right, unlike those poor American schoolchildren. Ours is a legacy we should be sharing and strengthening, and never, never undermining.</span>
              </p>

                <a href="275266" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MARTIN</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  Thank you, Mr President. Senators, ladies and gentlemen, I acknowledge the Ngunawal people, the traditional custodians of the land on which we meet, and pay my respects to their elders both past and present.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago a local journalist from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Advocate</span>, a tough little north-west newspaper not known for giving away easy free kicks, came to see me. While a kind profile piece was run, it was accompanied by the headline: 'Steve Martin, Bradbury of the Senate'. As we know, Senators, Steven Bradbury is, of course, the Australian speed skater legend who came from behind to win gold at the 2002 Winter Olympics as the other skaters skittled each other at the final bend. Others might take this headline as an insult or a backhanded compliment—perhaps that was even my instinctive response—but on reflection I have come to welcome the comparison. If nothing else, I'm in good company. We now have a small army of Bradburys in this chamber, thanks to section 44 of the Constitution. But, more importantly, there is a hidden moral in Bradbury's unlikely success story about being positive, having a dream, backing yourself against the odds and giving things a red-hot go. Steven Bradbury was not the world's best speed skater. He wasn't the strongest or the fastest. Frankly, his prospects were pretty dim. Imagine the self-doubt he had to overcome and the setbacks he faced along the way. But there he was, at the Olympics. He drew on all his courage and determination to get there. He put in all the hard work and then, at the fateful final turn, twice the gods smiled, the luck came to his side and the glory was his.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <span style="font-style:italic;">The Advocate</span> was right. It is positivity and determination along with the good fortune that sometimes follows which have delivered me into this rare and humbling position as a federal parliamentarian representing the great state of Tasmania in this Senate. It is a responsibility and an honour which I will take with great seriousness and humility. That same optimistic philosophy has carried me through the ups and downs of a career in small business, a sports shop, a newsagency and a Mexican restaurant. It has underpinned my longstanding involvement in community activity, from setting up a youth group to organising a grassroots campaign which saved the Mersey hospital to proudly serving in the Tasmania Fire Service and as an alderman and Mayor of the City of Devonport for many years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My point is that none of this was served up on a plate. All of it took hard work. All of it took a willingness to take a risk on what seemed at the time like distant and unlikely outcomes. This philosophy of optimism, of having a dream and backing yourself to get there, is, I believe, one we can all draw on whatever our political views. Moreover, it applies to us not just as individuals but also as a community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long political discussions about Tasmania have been overwhelmingly focused on the negatives. Time and again we are treated to tales of doom and gloom about failure, falling behind or not catching up. We hear discouraging words like 'malaise' and 'stagnation' and 'straggler'. We read that Tasmanians work less, earn less and are less productive than their mainland counterparts. We hear that our state ranks low in terms of education and literacy, wages, health, employment, investment and house prices, and it tops the states per capita in the sad categories of obesity and welfare receipts. The unsurprising effect has been to create a grim picture of a miserable state struggling in virtually every metric of economic and social development.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I don't buy into that narrative, and neither do Tasmanians. It doesn't stack up with the feeling on the ground. In recent weeks I've been driving around the state, speaking to lots of people, north and south, in towns and cities, boardrooms and universities, farms and community halls, and I can tell you that there is today an unmistakably vibrant sense of optimism and excitement about our future—and all Tasmanians know what I'm talking about.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first time in many years, the state government has been returned with a clear majority. Business confidence is up. Unemployment is coming down. Trade is growing, especially in agricultural exports, into the megamarkets of East Asia, most notably China. Building approvals are also up. This means benefits for both housing and the construction sector. Tourism—again, largely from China—is growing faster in Tasmania than in any other state. Even some of our problems—our new problems like housing shortages in Hobart—are symptoms of success, as surging demand for residential properties is driving up values. These are small and somewhat isolated data points, to be sure. They are contrasted by others which reflect ongoing difficulties, but taken together they are the early signs that things are going right—that, after a long and difficult period, we are on the cusp of a more sustained era of success. The pendulum is swinging our way.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The big ships which glide into the Mersey and pass my office every morning are called the <span style="font-style:italic;">Spirit of Tasmania</span>. They are aptly named because there is a human spirit in Tasmania which rises above the ABS data. It is a spirit built on a combination of resilience and sensitivity, toughness and kindness, a strong sense of community, equality and a deep love for sport. Rooted in geographic isolation from the mainland and to some extent from each other, it finds expression in strong local identities, a uniquely offbeat culture and a dry sense of humour.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't invoke this to gloss over or skirt our many difficult issues; I do it to recast them. They should not be seen as incurable problems, because they are not. Embedded in each challenge is an opportunity. In Tasmania, words like 'growth', 'investment', 'productivity' and 'competition' have tended to be used to describe a seemingly far-off dream. Our challenge is to harness that Tasmanian spirit, to bend it in ways that make these things everyday features of our economic reality.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We are well equipped for the struggle. Opportunities abound in mining and tourism. Our climate is the envy of rural and regional communities in Australia and around the world. We also have some of the world's cleanest air and purest water. The combination of above-average annual rainfall and free-draining soil creates unparalleled fertility, perfect conditions for rearing livestock, for horticulture, for aquaculture, for winemaking, for dairy and for growing fruit. Our agriculture sector is strong because it plays to our natural strengths. In each of these subsectors there is so much capacity just waiting to be harnessed. If you've ever had a Cape Grim steak, you've literally tasted the potential, and, if you picked up the bill at the restaurant, the chances are the economic possibilities haven't escaped you either!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In Tasmania small increases in production across the board, or bigger increases in just a few areas, have a major economic impact. We have so much to offer and so much to gain. The time is now to double-down on the best chances for more jobs, wage growth and investment, and that is why today I've agreed to support the government's company tax reforms. We need an internationally competitive tax rate for all our businesses, one that will provide industry with every opportunity to underpin our economic growth.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Strong industries need access to strong markets, and it is here that the government can do more. First, we need to strengthen our biosecurity. The recent outbreak of fruit fly in north and north-west Tasmania came as a shock to the system. While it looks to be contained, the incursion should serve as a timely reminder and a wake-up call. Fruit fly and other pests pose an unacceptable risk to our agricultural exports. They threaten the livelihood of our farmers and the reputation and economic wellbeing of our state. Our trading partners will not accept lax standards or lax compliance, and neither should we. I am proud that in my first week as a senator I was able to successfully negotiate a six-figure grant for Fruit Growers Tasmania. That money will be spent on a public awareness campaign to enhance compliance with biosecurity regulations, to ensure that a few bad imports do not destroy our exports. It's a good start, but we must go further. We need better coordination between federal and state governments to prevent and deal with infestations, as well as better resources to detect, isolate and eradicate threats as they appear.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, Tasmanian exporters need to be assured of a level playing field. Tasmania's unique geography offers some extraordinary advantages, but it also has its drawbacks. Most notably, it adds to the cost of getting goods to market. Unlike their counterparts on the mainland, Tasmanian businesses do not have the option of using road or rail before on-shipment to international markets. It is for this reason that the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme matters so much. Under the scheme, our exporters are entitled to a rebate which compensates for the added cost of having to ship goods by sea. I welcomed the expansion of the scheme back in 2016 and I commend the government's commitment last week to stick with it for the time being. We do, however, need a more concrete and long-term commitment on the expanded TFES, one which goes beyond the 2018-19 time frame. We also need a more regular review system than the current four-yearly approach. The level of assistance available must be tightly indexed to changes in the costs of shipping. This will ensure our businesses are getting the fairest possible deal. Only then can industry have the certainty they need and only then can they make the kinds of investments that create jobs and strengthen our economy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, we need responsible foreign policies which safeguard our economic future. Australia has benefited greatly from China's rise. It was China's massive demand for minerals which underpinned the mining boom that steered us through the global financial crisis and created an unprecedented era of wealth and prosperity for our country. Tasmania was dragged along to an extent, but it is only now that we are beginning to directly and fully capitalise, as a state, on the extraordinary opportunities made available by the growth of China's economy and booming middle class. As China is the biggest overseas market for Tasmanian exports and biggest source of overseas tourism, investment and international students, our economic prospects as a state and a nation are today tied to China, whether we like it or not. This means we need a good relationship. We need constructive and positive relations based on mutual respect and understanding. We must continue to work hard to ensure that we do not let relations deteriorate. Diplomatic cocktail parties in Canberra must feel a long way removed from a mine at Savage River, an arts space in Hobart, a farm in Spreyton or a vineyard in the Tamar Valley, but it is these places which feel the pain if relations go bad, and we simply cannot afford it. So those are some of the immediate priorities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the longer term, our most fundamental challenge as Tasmanians is education. Sir Douglas Copland, the first ever professor of economics at the University of Tasmania, described education as 'the most profitable investment a community can make.' He was right, and the evidence is undeniable. According to Saul Eslake, each additional year of school attained, on average, leads to between six and 19 per cent economic growth over the long run. People with a degree earn an average of 50 per cent more over their lives than those whose education ends at year 12. In turn, people whose education finishes at year 12 earn 40 per cent more than those who finish at or before year 10. The pattern is clear enough.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just financial. In addition to being more prosperous, people who are better educated tend to be less prone to gambling, drug abuse, alcoholism, obesity, crime and chronic illness. In short, a better education means a better life. If we are to seize our opportunities, if we are to boost workforce participation and productivity, if we are to enjoy a future in which we are healthy, wealthy and wise, the challenge falls largely on education.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Education has long been a difficult issue in Tasmania. Most of it comes down to an overly fragmented schooling system. Unlike other states, Tasmanian public schools—and, in some parts, its Catholic schools—have historically ended at year 10. Years 11 and 12 are delivered through separate colleges. The effect is to up-end the lives and educational pathways of students at precisely the time they need stability. To complete years 11 and 12, our students often have to travel further and at greater expense. Their peer groups and support networks are dispersed, and that crucial bond between teacher and student, in which four years have been invested, is broken and must be re-formed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Predictably, this is where too many educational journeys end. But let me be clear: this is no indictment on the individual colleges themselves. They are good institutions and they are staffed by passionate and professional teachers and principals. In many cases—for example, at Don College in Devonport—they consistently produce excellent results. The problem lies with a system which stacks the decks against them and in which too few year 10 students continue into colleges in the first place. Our students are our most precious resource. We need to minimise the economic barriers and maximise access to a world-class education. That is why, for as long as I serve in this chamber, I will oppose any cuts to education—period.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course an education system is not just about dollars. It is about culture, and specifically a culture which encourages learning, takes pride in its students and celebrates their achievements. A good primary education sets our kids up for success at high school, and solid secondary schooling provides pathways to good jobs or university. But where does this process begin? The answer, of course, is: at birth. It is the early years which set the foundation for lifelong learning. The process occurs as our kids grow, develop a sense of self and begin to engage with the world around them. Government has a critical, crucial role in strengthening early childhood learning, including underwriting a fair and agile system of childcare rebates and ensuring our states' programs are funded at a level which reflects their importance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Families matter just as much. It is in the home where our education begins—bedtime stories or dinnertime discussions, questions asked and answered, counting, drawing and learning about colours. These might have been seen just as a childish pastime, but we now know they are building blocks of success. That is why in the coming weeks I will be expanding my program 'Books for Babies'. Under the scheme, we will be giving a free book to as many babies as we can who are born in Tasmania this year. The idea is to give our kids a little leg up, a gift of encouragement as they set out on their lives of learning. With good government programs and an educational culture built on encouragement for learning in the home, the school and beyond, we have every reason to be excited about the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me end on one issue on which Tasmanians can be forgiven for feeling less optimistic. I speak, of course, about the troubled state of Australian Rules football—specifically, about the ongoing neglect by the AFL of Tasmania's ambition to be represented in both the men's and women's game at the most senior level of the competition. Almost 30 years after the creation of a so-called national league, Tasmania remains without a team or even a genuine pathway. This is a disgrace! New South Wales has two teams; Queensland has two teams; so do South Australia and Western Australia. And Tasmania has none.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Having excluded our blokes for decades, the AFL had a recent chance to make amends, with the creation of the new AFL women's comp. They failed to do so. So now they're excluding our girls, and this is also unacceptable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This is sad reality. But the reasons behind it are even worse. Tasmanians' exclusion has nothing to do with a lack of talent. We are the state that produced the likes of Darrel Baldock, Royce Hart, Matthew Richardson and many others. Today, Richmond's Jack Riewoldt exemplifies the talent, skill and leadership that Tasmanian football can offer. It's not the tough financial requirements of sustaining a team, either. Under the fly-in, fly-out arrangements with Hawthorn and North Melbourne, Tasmanians already pay as much per capita for football as, and, in some cases, more than, those in other states. Perversely, Tasmanians are penalised because we love the game. We already watch and support football as much as we can, and it is embedded in our DNA. To the AFL, we are therefore a market taken for granted. In the cold financial calculus of the AFL, they have nothing to gain by fulfilling our dreams of a Tassie team.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me assure you that this issue is about more than just football. It's about equality, community and national inclusion. It also has deep social implications. Some years ago, AFL Tasmania conducted an interesting experiment. They wanted to see whether the unemployment rates in Burnie's local football teams lined up with the overall unemployment rate in the town. What they found was astounding. Where unemployment for men aged 18 to 30 hovered somewhere around 20 per cent, in the football clubs it was zero. There's a number of reasons, of course. Young footballers are well equipped with the kinds of skills which make them highly employable. They work in teams, they're good under pressure, and they're fit, healthy and disciplined. The footy teams were also acting as a social support network; where a player lost a job, the word went out and another job was found.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Professor Jonathan West, also from the University of Tasmania, it is the loss of a local football team that spells the greatest trouble for country towns, and this is exactly what is happening. AFL in Tasmania is in crisis. Burnie and Devonport have withdrawn from the state league. The stands are empty. Community involvement—once, nearly half the population, in some form or another—is plummeting, and our kids are understandably deserting footy in droves to play other sports.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">After dragging his heels for months, AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan is today finally in Tasmania to help staunch the bleeding. More needs to be done. Only by creating a road map to a men's and a women's team in the senior comps can we fully re-energise Tasmanian football, one of our biggest social institutions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I am realistic. I understand that you can't get a team with a click of the fingers. But I'm also eager. What I ask is that a new and updated business plan be commissioned to jump-start the process, and I stand ready to work with the AFL and AFL Tasmania on this important issue, and I am prepared to use all the moral and political weight of my office to do so.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be remiss of me to conclude this speech without some important acknowledgements. They say it takes a village to raise a child. Well, it takes a whole state to raise a senator. Tonight I offer my heartfelt thanks to the people of Tasmania, for it is an honour and privilege to be representing you here today. I promise to fight for our great state with every bit of dedication and tenacity I can muster.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wish to acknowledge my family, who are a great inspiration and a source of endless love, encouragement and support. When I was elected as mayor of Devonport in 2011, it was a proud day for both my parents, John and Patricia Martin, though, sadly, Dad passed away on my first official day as mayor. Dad was a proud man. He was also a footy legend who believed in a firm handshake and the idea that your word is your bond. It was through his service as a volunteer firefighter that he instilled in me a strong commitment to my community service. As for my mum, she's also very proud. Her patience and gentle guidance, her kindness and good humour have helped shape who I am. I am incredibly proud of my children, Rachel and Alex. They are both grown up now and each has a beautiful daughter, Ilse and Edie. Both my grandchildren said they want me to become Prime Minister. I told them they would just have to be patient. My brother, Brett, and I have always been very close, playing sport together, delivering newspapers and serving in the volunteer fire service. It meant a lot to me that Brett and his wife, Karen, were here the day I became a senator.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of all, I want to thank my beautiful and intelligent wife, Susanne, who's in the gallery tonight. Everyone here knows how tough a life in politics can be on a family. Susanne is always there and has been fully supportive of everything that I do. She's a very understanding and patient woman, and she is really my rock. Susanne, I love you and I'm very lucky to have you. Thank you for being in my life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond my family, I take this opportunity to recognise a few people who have played an inspirational role in my life. Gary Davenport, a Tasmanian basketball legend, has been a lifetime mentor. As a boy, basketball was a huge part of my life, and I often snuck into the stadium to watch him play. Later, as teammates, he once hit me at full pace in the back of the head with his trademark look-away bullet-like pass. This taught me to never take my eye off the ball. Gary told me to take it as a valuable life lesson, and it has been. Deborah Thomson is a more recent friend who courageously told a story of 15 years of abuse in her book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Who's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Life Is It Anyway?</span> Deborah is helping raise awareness and understanding of the horrors of domestic violence, and, as a long-time ambassador for White Ribbon, I encourage everyone to do more to end that terrible scourge. Sue Smith, a former mayor of Central Coast Council and past President of the Tasmanian Legislative Council, has been a friend, a sounding-board and a rich source of good advice. Sue was especially important in encouraging me to set up my youth group, Enormity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In that vein, I acknowledge all past and present members of that amazing group. They embody the spirit of optimism of which I spoke, and it has been an honour to have played a part in their journey. Founded in 1996, the idea of Enormity was to empower young people to make a difference to the issues that matter to them. After all, young people are today's consultants for tomorrow's world. Enormity members have done amazing things, from representing Tasmania in a range of international events to actively campaigning to stop human trafficking and child prostitution. Their work to raise awareness of homelessness through their winter coat appeal has been nothing less than extraordinary. It is an appeal that went nationwide, securing the support of former prime ministers Howard, Rudd and Gillard and current Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. In leaving the group, one of our former presidents, Leah Lynd, wrote me a letter, which I had framed. In it, Leah writes of how the group gave her 'self-worth, self-respect and a place to belong'. Leah then talks of how the lessons she learnt in Enormity will stay with her forever. She concludes by saying:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">I arrived here in the federal parliament in rather extraordinary circumstances. I have been humbled by the warmth and generosity of all my colleagues here, both in the chamber and in the offices that make this place tick. For that, I give thanks. I also acknowledge Jacqui Lambie and the JLN for giving me the opportunity to run on their Senate ticket in the 2016 election.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to get here, I referred myself to the High Court to deal with questions about my eligibility. The issue was whether a mayor or a local alderman was an office of profit under the Crown for the purposes of section 44 of the Constitution. In securing a decision from the full bench, I am proud to have set an important legal precedent. This decision clears the way for mayors, aldermen and councillors to run for the federal parliament without having to sacrifice their jobs and livelihoods—and they are precisely the kinds of people we need here. To my incredible legal team, Philip Solomon QC, Dr Charles Parkinson and the hardworking solicitors at Corrs West-garth Melbourne, I say thank you.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I acknowledge my brilliant staff—Brooke, Raoul, Brian, April, Janine and Rodney. Working for me sometimes must feel like a labour of love. Their passionate and dedicated support for me in this role is an inspiration every day.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an exciting time for Australia and Tasmania. We have so much to gain and so much to offer. As I set out in this role as a senator for Tasmania, I'm honoured to be part of that journey. In conclusion, I leave you with this thought from Dr Seuss, a towering figure in childhood literacy: 'It's not about what it is; it's about what it can become.' Thank you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="111206" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LEYONHJELM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  According to popular legend, Hitler's master of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, said: 'A lie told once is still a lie. But a lie told a thousand times becomes the truth.' The claim that there have been no mass shootings since the introduction of John Howard's 1996 gun laws has probably been repeated many more than a thousand times, which is perhaps why so many people believe it is the truth. But it was a lie when it was first told, and it's still a lie now. In the 20 years following 1996, there were 14 shootings in Australia involving multiple victims. Of these, 12 involved two or three fatalities, one involved four fatalities and one involved five fatalities. The death toll would have been higher but for some luck and life-saving medical attention. In the 20 years before 1996, there were also 12 shootings involving multiple victims, although there were more deaths in total.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to America's FBI, a mass shooting is defined as 'four or more people shot and/or killed in a single event at the same general time and location, not including the shooter'. In 2014, there was a mass shooting in New South Wales involving the Hunt family in which there were four victims plus the shooter. This qualifies as a mass shooting under the FBI definition, and yet a couple of academics, Philip Alpers and Simon Chapman, who are in fact foundation members of the anti-gun lobby, recently wrote a paper in which they repeated the lie that there had been no mass shootings in Australia since 1996. Under their definition, a mass shooting requires at least six victims, including the shooter. They gained some publicity for themselves as a result of making this claim, but the simple fact is that they arbitrarily changed the definition of a mass shooting to suit their agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very few Australians will recognise the fabrication involved in this claim. Most of those claiming there have been no mass shootings since 1996 have never thought much about it. For them, it sounds sufficient to claim that massacres occurred before, but not after, the gun laws. They then draw the simple conclusion that the gun laws made the difference. It might be simplistic, but it sounds compelling. But it is false. There were just as many multiple-victim shootings in the 20 years after the introduction of the 1996 gun laws as there were in the 20 years before they were introduced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, really, is that all that matters? Is there something special about being murdered in a mass shooting, unlike being shot in some other way or even killed in some other way? Obviously not. A far better analysis of the impact of the 1996 gun laws would be to look at the overall level of murders attributable to firearms. When you look at that, what you find is that firearm deaths were declining in the 20 years before 1996 and they continued to fall after 1996 at precisely the same rate. Multiple statistical tests have confirmed that it is precisely the same rate. Furthermore, this occurred despite a substantial increase in licensed firearm ownership—many more guns, in other words. The simple fact is the gun laws in 1996 made no difference to the rate of decline—no difference at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This 'no massacres, no mass shootings' claim is also often accompanied by a comparison with the United States. There's no denying the US does have mass shootings. Australia doesn't—or not many, anyway—therefore, it must be the gun laws that explain it. Or so the argument goes. It's simple minded claptrap. It's so dumb that it's amazing anyone falls for it, and yet you hear it all the time. Once again, the facts are ignored. Notwithstanding the high-profile mass shootings that do occur from time to time in the United States, the rate of gun deaths in that country during the last three decades has declined quite fast—faster, indeed, than in Australia, albeit from a higher starting point. At the same time, over the same period, gun laws in America have been substantially relaxed. In fact, in 42 states, a person without a criminal record or violent history can now carry a gun for self-defence. In the other eight states, a gun can be carried in case of special need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, nobody bothers to compare us with countries such as New Zealand that continue to have gun laws resembling those that were found in Australia before 1996 but that, like us, continue to see falling gun deaths; or Switzerland, which has a far higher ratio of guns to people than Australia and yet its rate of gun violence is no greater than Australia's. Yet the assumption is made that, if we relaxed our gun laws to be more like those in New Zealand or Switzerland, we'd end up like America, not like New Zealand or Switzerland. It's an absurd assumption.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm all for debate about gun laws, but let's stick to incontrovertible facts, not those that become facts because they have been repeated many times.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the continuing strength of Australia's gun laws. Indeed I would like to see gun laws strengthened—I say that up-front. I can't ever remember a time when I wasn't opposed to guns, even as a small child. Certainly as a parent I went to great lengths to try and educate my children about the dangers of guns. I appreciate that in some parts of Australian society we do have guns. Guns are needed on farms, our police force carry guns and so on. Our armed forces carry guns. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the everyday carrying or use of guns by ordinary citizens. I simply don't see the point and I don't support the use of guns. We see the shocking deaths in the US, where thousands of schoolchildren have taken to the streets to say that they want to make their schools safe. What a sad indictment it is of a country when some children feel that it's no longer safe to go to schools. Our schools should be sanctuaries, and yet for some children they are not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't really think it matters if gun violence and deaths from shootings are declining. What matters is that they're happening in the first place. Any death through a shooting is a shocking thing and we should all, as a society, be opposed to that. I certainly don't support young children being able to get gun licences, as is the case in some states across this country. I'm proud to say that in Western Australia you have to be 18 years of age to get a gun licence. In Western Australia, if you've got a history of domestic violence, you also can't get a gun licence. If you've got an issue around mental health, you are, again, unable to get a gun licence. But, really, our gun laws should be uniform across this country. What applies in one state should be the case in another state because we don't want to see people being able to take advantage in one state where they can't in another.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've never been a fan of John Howard's—never ever—but his bravery in standing up after Port Arthur needs to be commended. I remember seeing him on the news being absolutely heckled by people who thought they had some right to carry arms and by the National Rifle Association, which is way, way too influential in our politics these days, particularly in state politics. He did a great job, but what we've seen since then is the watering down of gun laws. It's starting to become easier, and we don't want that. We don't have that history of the right to bear arms and the gun violence that we see in the US, and we certainly don't want to see that in Australia as a rule.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend my friend and colleague, Michelle Roberts, who is concerned that in Western Australia we have seen a spike in drive-by shootings and woundings. She has taken action on that, and she's looking at some of the recommendations by the WA Law Reform Commission to introduce what are known as firearms prohibition orders, which already exist in other states. Again, gun violence should be something where we simply have national standards so that, for every state and territory in this nation, there's a uniform provision around gun laws. I have to say that I was quite shocked to learn that there are differences, and I was really shocked to hear that, in some states, children of 10 years of age can be given a gun licence, presumably to shoot on a range somewhere. That's just inappropriate. Why we would want to introduce our children to guns at such an early age defies logic, as far as I'm concerned. And I want to make sure that Australia remains a safe country and that we don't have guns being freely available. I do admit that they are somewhat freely available at the moment, but the more we can clamp down on that, the stronger our laws can be on stopping guns, and the more we as a culture embrace the fact that we don't want to see guns in this country, the better off we'll be.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:47</span>):  The Nick Xenophon Team agrees with the need to strengthen our firearms laws to reduce gun violence. Indeed, we could have had stronger gun laws last year when the government's Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill 2017 was amended and adopted by the Senate in February 2017. It’s now over 13 months since the nation could have had tougher, stronger and better gun laws, but, due to government stubbornness, the bill as agreed to by the Senate was rejected in the other place. As a result, we do not have those laws in place today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nick Xenophon Team sought to strengthen the bill by moving sensible amendments that would have increased the maximum penalties for firearm-trafficking offences within Australia and into and out of Australia. As I said before, these amendments were supported by the Senate. We also supported Labor's amendments which sought to strengthen the bill with life sentences for the worst kinds of firearm traffickers and which also sought to remove the mandatory sentencing provisions in the bill. Mandatory minimum sentences are inappropriate and do not currently exist in the Commonwealth Criminal Code. They restrict judicial discretion and hamper the sentencing judge's ability to hand down a sentence that is appropriate after taking into account all of the circumstances of an individual case. Mandatory minimum sentences depart from the fundamental principle that the punishment should fit the crime. Law enforcement agencies don't like mandatory minimum sentences because they mean offenders are less likely to cooperate with the police to bring down other serious criminals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Illegal firearms remain a major issue in Australia. During last year's national firearms amnesty, 57,324 firearms were handed in. Authorities received around 2,500 fully automatic or semiautomatic guns that were previously unaccounted for, and 2,900 handguns. That is a lot of firepower that had the potential to cause very serious harm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of us in this place must work to keep our communities safe. We must support tougher sentences for gun traffickers. The government should have passed the bill as it was agreed to in the Senate. It is now time to stop playing political games with peoples' lives and for the government to take the right action to protect all Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  This MPI is another example of an attack on our individual freedoms, thinly veiled as a progressive solution to gun related violence. The real solution to gun related crime is to target criminals who use illegal weapons to commit acts of violence with effective jail terms, not law-abiding licensed gun owners. Australians already have some of the strictest gun laws in the world, yet our rate of gun crime is still similar to that of New Zealand. We have legislation that allows firearms to be banned just for their appearance—not for their effective range, rate of fire or capacity but for how they look. They can be banned just because they look scary. This is verging on the irrational.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our firearms laws, according to Senator Rhiannon, are the envy of the world, yet she is still advocating stricter controls. For example, banning the Adler shotgun—a firearm that many rural Queenslanders have had to use—is making a tough life on their cattle places that little bit tougher. Firearms aren't the issue; people are. If you are a radical or a lunatic who wants to kill innocent people, you will find a way. As we have seen with Bourke Street, with the radical in France who took to the pavement in a truck or with the London Bridge attack, those who are hell-bent on causing terror and harming innocents will. However, by the same token, if you drive your van on to the sidewalk and kill people, are we going to ban vans? What about if you go on a stabbing spree—are we going to ban knives? Increasing the already chokingly restrictive gun controls isn't going to change the outcomes for our nation. We need a clearer focus on those who commit crimes, not more firearm controls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are approximately 34,000 gun related deaths each year in America, 94 per cent of which are committed by criminals with illegal weapons. A change in the gun laws will not get the desired outcome. They are already outside the regular framework. The bottom line is that, overwhelmingly, gun related violent crime is done by criminals using unlicensed firearms. Changing the legislation has no more effect on the gun crime rate than watering your geraniums. Look at Chicago, Detroit or New Orleans: they have some of the strictest gun laws in the US—and the highest murder rates. There is a common misconception that an increase in registered firearms means you are going to see more gun violence perpetrated across the community. Once again, law-abiding gun owners are being targeted and victimised simply for owning firearms. To reiterate, a real solution to gun— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  I speak in support of this Matter of Public Importance. It is now over 20 years since the horrendous massacre in Port Arthur in Tasmania, and it is very important that we remain as vigilant as ever not to allow our gun laws to be weakened. Indeed, in some cases, I believe they need to still be further strengthened. It's particularly concerning to me—and the Greens more broadly, as my colleague Senator Rhiannon mentioned in her comments—the increasing amount of money that the gun lobby is pouring into Australian politics and towards Australian political parties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own state of Queensland, it's very clear that the cashed-up gun lobby tried to buy the results it wanted in the Queensland election. The Queensland Shooters Union is affiliated with the notorious NRA in the US and threw thousands into the campaigns of One Nation candidates. The Katter party received over $175,000 from one particular gun dealer, and the Electoral Commission's disclosure system showed that in total the Katter party received nearly half a million dollars from firearms interest groups. The Shooting Industry Foundation of Australia spent over half a million dollars itself on TV, radio and online advertising trying to get a weakening of the gun laws in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just like the NRA, the Queensland Shooters Union and the Shooting Industry Foundation of Australia are not merely gun enthusiasts concerned about their rights. I support sporting shooters and their right to conduct legitimate activities. I support farmers and their right to use firearms appropriately in the course of their business. But what these lobby groups are about is trying to expand the firearms industry. In the US, the NRA buys politicians to protect the profits of the arms industry. That is something that cannot be disputed. Unless we move urgently to reform our own political donation system, we could see the same here. The lives of our friends, families, children and loved ones could, potentially, be sacrificed for profit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we need to ensure that we ban political donations from the gun lobby. The Greens' view is that we should ban political donations from all for-profit corporations but particularly those from industries that seek to promote profits in areas that are harmful. The Queensland government has made a small advance in moving to ban donations from property developers, which have been shown quite directly to corrupt our political system. Surely, in areas such as this, the gun lobby in particular is an industry we need to be banning donations from. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  The demonising of law-abiding gun owners is unhelpful to the debate about violence in this country. The bashing of gun owners must stop. Many law-abiding Australians responsibly use firearms to work and hunt and for sport, and this needs to be taken into consideration. A gun to a farmer is what a wrench is to a plumber—a tool that, if removed, makes the business unworkable. A farmer's central job is to protect the environment, to make the land profitable and productive. There is no greater threat to our precious environment than feral pests such as wild pigs, foxes, cats, dogs and rabbits.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Greens want to contribute to this debate in a productive way, they could analyse and honestly discuss the existing laws. Existing laws state that only licensed gun dealers can trade or sell guns. Adverts for guns are very closely monitored. The police work with gun traders and are tough on illegal gun sales, as they should be. If the Greens were serious about stopping gun violence, they would look at resourcing police. The trouble with guns comes when they get into the hands of criminals. The logical extension to solving gun violence is resourcing the police so they can find illegal arms dealers and bring them to justice.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have been lawfully and reasonably carrying weapons for a variety of reasons for generations. New laws introduced over recent years have made owning a gun even tougher. Law-abiding citizens are not the problem with guns; criminals are.

                  </a>  These are seven reports from the Commonwealth Ombudsman in regard to people who have been in immigration detention in Australia for two years or more, a provision that was inserted in the Migration Act when the coalition was in government, prior to the Rudd-Gillard years, because of a recognition of how out of control our detention system was. There are seven reports here from the Commonwealth Ombudsman and seven responses from the minister. Rather than go through each of the individual cases, I'd simply point out that, collectively, these reports refer to 222 individuals who have all been in detention in Australia for over two years—some of them more than three, some of the more than four, and some over five years. These are truly people who have been forgotten and have been locked away indefinitely by virtue of our laws despite, let's not forget, never having committed a crime and despite not having ever been charged with a crime. Unfortunately, Labor and Liberal have continued to support the mandatory detention regime that has been in place in this country, to our shame, for over 25 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to mention particularly the fact that a family from my own state of Queensland is currently in detention in Melbourne. They've only recently come there. I really hope and pray that, in two years time, there's not a report tabled about them still being in detention. I am talking about a family of Tamil background—a husband and wife and two very young daughters—who were taken from the community of Biloela in the very early hours of the morning and who currently reside in a detention centre in Queensland. There was a huge public response, including and in particular from the community of Biloela, calling on the immigration minister to get this family out of detention, to let them back into the community where they have lived peacefully and constructively for over three years. We have a government that complains about how migrants aren't integrating properly in the community. It complains that we need to have more people moving to regional areas. Yet we had this family, who moved to regional Queensland to the town of Biloela, who were working in jobs that they have difficulty finding other people to fill and who were welcomed and supported in their community in regional Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I draw attention to the petition in relation to this family. It has been online just for a short period of time, and it's got a huge number of signatures. The petition was started by Angela Fredericks from Biloela, who talks about how this couple and their daughters are valuable members of this rural community of Biloela in Central Queensland. They had lived there for over three years and are a caring, hardworking family. This peaceful family were going about their early morning routine, with the husband getting ready to go to his job at the local meatworks and the wife preparing a bottle for the baby. At 5 am, their home was stormed by armed police and Border Force officers. Their seven-month-old baby and their 2½-year-old daughter were ripped from their beds. The couple were told they were being taken to a Melbourne detention centre and were given 10 minutes to pack up their entire lives. They were put into separate vans, driven to Gladstone Airport and then flown to a detention centre in Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Border Force officers told them that if they didn't sign so-called voluntary deportation documents they would be denied access to a phone and would be separated and forced back to Sri Lanka—permanent separation, potentially, for the family. Despite begging to be returned to the community of Biloela where they had been welcomed and supported, after two days of pressure, they gave in and signed the documents. This family has been held in a single room surrounded by three armed guards. They were settled in Biloela after fleeing torture and suffering in Sri Lanka. Despite the advice of many human rights organisations on the ground, the current government, no doubt aided by behind-the-scenes political deals with the Sri Lankan government, is now pretending that Sri Lanka is safe for Tamil people, which is why they're trying to force this couple and their young children back to Sri Lanka. The document says, 'Our community in Biloela is not ready to let this family go. They love contributing to our society. We want them here.' They call on Mr Dutton: 'Please return this family to Biloela, their home, where they are wanted and welcome,' and I join in that call. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired.)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee received the responses from NBN Co last Wednesday, 24 March. The due date set by the committee, which I remind the Senate is chaired by the government, was Friday, 19 January—two months late again. This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't happening every single time. NBN Co, the department of communications and Minister Fifield seem to be in absolutely no rush to answer questions about the NBN rollout. These are questions, I might add, that are of vital importance to the proper functioning of this place: questions relating to the disastrous HFC rollout; questions on faults, complaints and customer satisfaction; questions on deployment and on minimal achievable speeds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Turnbull thought he would switch on the HFC network like he would a toaster. Even after breaking his 2013 election promise, Mr Turnbull, the then communications minister, promised to have 2.6 million homes on HFC by the end of 2016. He only got up to 160,000—seven per cent of his target. HFC was meant to be the great saviour across many of our mainland cities. Instead, we then saw leaked reports that NBN Co would dump the Optus HFC network. We then heard of HFC cost blowouts. Of course, NBN denied these leaks. But then, in September 2016, the now Prime Minister announced that the Optus HFC would be dumped and that the cost of the remaining HFC network had blown out by $2 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of transparency in relation to the NBN project displayed by the non-answers provided by NBN Co to many of these questions and by the ridiculous delay in even responding is disappointing and reflects a paranoia that has gripped the Turnbull government. On 14 November 2017 the Senate voted to order a special hearing of the NBN committee. This vote in the Senate appears to have triggered panic within NBN Co, as they were sitting on further secrets about the HFC network that were not in the public domain. We have now learnt that only days later NBN Co executives ambushed public officials and Minister Fifield with news that NBN Co would halt the HFC rollout due to reliability problems. The HFC delay could cost taxpayers up to $500 million, money that could have been spent delivering a better technology mix, pushing more fibre closer to people's homes and businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The constant delays in these responses to parliamentary scrutiny are nothing short of an attempt to reduce accountability. Minister Fifield, the Department of Communications and the Arts and NBN Co need to lift their game. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  This report looks at the issues around the Burrup Peninsula, which is in the Dampier Archipelago in the Pilbara in Western Australia, the area known as Murujuga. This is a very important report. You will note that it's in four parts. There's a majority committee report and then three other reports, basically from the Greens, the government senators and the ALP senators. It's quite a controversial report. It looks into the Commonwealth's responsibility under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 to protect the globally significant and National Heritage listed Aboriginal rock art on the Dampier peninsula in Western Australia. There are long terms of reference. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry was initiated by the Greens to look at some really important issues. We are talking about the highest concentration of rock art in the world. Over a million petroglyphs and images are concentrated in that relatively small space on the Burrup Peninsula. It's a World Heritage valued area—it's not on the World Heritage List yet, and I'll get back to that. Guess what governments have done there over the years? In this relatively small area, with that huge concentration of petroglyphs, over the years governments have located industry there. There's gas processing plants, there's fertiliser plants and there's the TAN plant, which, by the way, is operating under a preparation and building licence rather than the full licence, which I'll also come back to in a minute. There are serious issues there. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If people in chamber haven't seen this world valued rock art I advise you to go up and have a look. It is magnificent. I have visited the area on a number of occasions, and it is truly astounding. I haven't visited the whole lot, of course, because there's a million petroglyphs and I have only visited areas that are suitable for public viewing. Some of the art is regarded as sacred. Some is men's art and men's business and some is women's. It is truly magnificent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So they've established this industry there. The latest plant on the peninsula, next to the fertiliser plant, is the TAN plant. The conditions of approval for that plant are based on flawed science or flawed interpretation of the science. The issue here is that the emissions from this industry affect the rock art through a very complicated process, which the committee was taken through. Part of what it does is affect the patina on the surface of the rock. Effectively, that undermines the rock art, the carvings and the petroglyphs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The conditions that were initially set were based on a flawed interpretation by the CSIRO—who, by the way, I hold in very high regard. But, in this instance, I think that they have made very serious errors. They based their interpretation of the impact of the emissions from industry on a study by Cinderby et al on the impact of industry emissions and air pollution on monuments—on monuments! Even the authors of that study say there is an incorrect use of their work in the interpretation by the Gillett 2008 report—the CSIRO report. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, we have here a set of conditions that are based on flawed interpretation of data. They were written to guide the monitoring of the plant and the conditions that were put on the plant, which has now already been built on the Burrup. Not only that, but the monitoring process that has been undertaken of the previous conditions from the other plants that are on the Burrup has also been found wanting. It was very difficult at the beginning of this process to get some of the information out of the Western Australian government. That significantly changed when the ALP government came in. However, there's still an uphill battle to get them to recognise the full extent of the impact of this plant, particularly its cumulative effect—in other words, the new plant with the existing gas processing plants that are there and the existing fertiliser plants that are there. They will be having a cumulative impact. One of the recommendation in the Greens additional comments is that a study be done of the cumulative impacts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens, but specifically Senator Whish-Wilson and I, made 15 recommendations in our additional comments. We recommend that the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 be amended to require the minister or their delegate to consider the cumulative effects when approving decisions, and that's certainly what needs to be done here. They need to be assessing the cumulative impacts. There also needs to be an acknowledgement by CSIRO that the assessment they did was fundamentally flawed, because it was. We also recommend that the Western Australian government prioritise the development and implementation of a new, fully funded independent monitoring program that meets all of the recommendations of the Data Analysis Australia reviews. The problems here were so intense that they had to have an independent review of the data and of the process, and they made a series of recommendations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key things that we also recommend is in fact that the plant be moved. What also happened in Western Australia is that, a number of years ago—in fact, it was so long ago I was still a coordinator of the Conservation Council and I remember commenting on this proposal—they set up a new precinct for industry a bit south of the peninsula, in the Pilbara, called the Maitland industrial estate so that industry could locate there. That was an area that there was very little fighting over, once they got the basic approvals for locating industry there. This plant could have gone there, and it should be there, because there are ongoing problems with fugitive emissions and with emissions of nitrate that are way over what should be emitted. We've referred to that in our additional comments. We also recommend that the Commonwealth government, in conjunction with the Western Australian government, establish measurements of existing emissions as a matter of priority. We're not even doing that properly. We also recommend that the Western Australian government implement measures to ensure that the emission load on the Burrup Peninsula is reduced. It is critical, because I for one have absolutely no faith in the monitoring results that we have seen, with the evidence that I have heard, that we understand the impact of the emissions on this world-famous rock art of world importance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last comment I'll make in my remaining 30 seconds is that Australia should put this area on the tentative World Heritage List, in consultation with the Western Australian government and the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation. We should be putting this on the tentative World Heritage List and then working with the corporation and with the Western Australian government to make sure this is listed on the World Heritage List. This is clearly of World Heritage value. It needs to be listed, and it needs to be listed as soon as possible.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DODSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  I also want to take note of the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee report on the Aboriginal rock art of the Burrup Peninsula. It needs to be recognised that spiritual connections to land, to country, transcend time and place. The First Nations of Australia hold and care for the oldest cultural history on the planet. In my home state of Western Australia, the Burrup Peninsula and the Dampier Archipelago, in particular, are home to one of the largest and oldest collections of rock art in the world. Within this collection is the world's oldest known artistic record of a human face. It is an embodiment of a profound moment in the evolution of our human species, the moment when somebody, now unknown, first had the idea to portray our human selves in art. His or her family descendants still live in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Heritage Council reported in 2011 that the rock art collection represents a masterpiece of human creative genius and is one of the most exciting and significant collections of rock engravings in the world. There is no denying the immense and irreplaceable cultural and spiritual significance of this rock art to first-nations people. Country is the beating heart of our spirituality, of our culture and of our heritage. The protection of and caring for country, including this magnificent site, ensures a sense of identity and belonging that permeates through the land—the connections of which lead to better outcomes for individuals and families across the nation. As a nation with such a rich history of culture and tradition, it is time that Australia fully acknowledges the vital need to cherish and celebrate the artefacts which reflect our incredible history. We also must not underestimate the international archaeological and heritage value of such a unique site and our responsibilities, as a global citizen, to care for these places.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation for their contribution to this inquiry and for their hospitality when I visited there. The report points to some significant issues that relate to the Burrup and to broader Australian politics. The current lack of an effective and realistic approach to consultation is one example of this government's utter failure to address the needs of first-nations Australians. What is often lacking is community control and the direct involvement of first-nations peoples. Labor believes in the absolute necessity of free, prior and informed consent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and communities in resource management and in conservation decisions. This right is guaranteed under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which Australia has ratified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm deeply concerned and disappointed in the finding that the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation was largely left out of decisions on the management of the Burrup. It is concerning that none of the current board, and only a small number of the elders, were invited to participate in discussions on World Heritage listing eight or 10 years ago. I note the concerns of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation that a World Heritage listing may change or reduce the ability of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation to manage the area. We believe that the government must fully consult with the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation and the Murujuga Circle of Elders to make sure that any future consideration of World Heritage listing for Murujuga is led by the traditional owners of Murujuga. The Indigenous Murujuga Rangers play an integral and authoritative role in the management and protection of the Murujuga but, regrettably, have no power of enforcement. All enforcement power currently solely lies with the Western Australian national parks rangers. If we are serious about ensuring protection of country, Aboriginal rangers need the authority to act when things aren't being done properly in their country. I note that the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation and the Western Australian government are developing a feasibility study for a multipurpose Murujuga Living Knowledge Centre in or near the park. This is an important initiative which potentially enhances social and economic benefits. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are significant technical issues, as Senator Siewert raised in her report. In particular, Professor John Black and his colleagues have undertaken a comprehensive review of the CSIRO reports on damage to the sites caused by industrial emissions. Professor Black's findings indicate major flaws in the works undertaken by the CSIRO on behalf of the Western Australian government. The evidence is clear that the analysis of rock art monitoring between 2004 and 2014 did not include adequate statistical analysis and that the measurements that were taken were unreliable. The colour of the rock art has changed some 13 per cent over 13 years—a major concern for the preservation of the significant rock art. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequences of disregarding the damage being caused to the rock art are irreversible, and a new monitoring program is overdue. As Labor senators, we believe that this should be a priority for the Western Australian government and, if necessary, for the Commonwealth government as well. The views and recommendations tabled in this report speak to an imperative need to engage in partnerships to protect country that recognise and respect the rights of the first-nations peoples in the region. We have a rare and phenomenal opportunity to take on the obligation to protect, celebrate and cherish these artefacts on behalf of the whole world, including our own nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In understanding the importance of protecting the Burrup Peninsula and working towards a united nation that celebrates and benefits from such ancient and wondrous culture, we must learn to talk together, walk together and, beyond all, experience country together. The Burrup Peninsula is home to one of the oldest, most concentrated and culturally significant galleries of rock art on the earth. It captures the contrast between the rampant industrial development and the struggles of First Nations to retain Indigenous heritage and to maintain their living culture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Burrup is a stunning and powerful place. The vibrant red rocks against the blue ocean and the sky, and the trees that surround it, are reminders of our beautiful country and the role we must play in protecting it. I commend this report and trust it contributes to the protection of this site, this country and the First Nations who care for it on our behalf.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  On behalf of coalition senators, I will also make a brief contribution in regard to this particular inquiry of the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee. I'm not normally a member of the committee, but, given the significance of the issue to Western Australia and the Burrup Peninsula, on this occasion I thought I would make myself available. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People will see a couple of things in this report that are worthy of attention. The first is the undisputed nature of a number of elements of the report. The coalition, the Greens and Labor agree on a number of undisputed things. The primary issue there is the very real historical and cultural significance of this particular part of Australian heritage, of Indigenous heritage, and the very special place that this rock art has. That is undisputed. For the record, I will quote into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> what the Senate report says. It makes three particular points. In paragraph 7.4, it says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Heritage Council reported in 2011 that the rock art collection represents a masterpiece of human creative genius and is one of the most exciting and significant collections of rock engravings in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not disputed by anyone on the committee. Paragraph 7.5 goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recognises and acknowledges the vast cultural and historical values of the rock art of the Burrup Peninsula and is of the view that it is critical that the petroglyphs should be protected and conserved for current and future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is undisputed. Finally, paragraph 7.6 says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee acknowledges the substantial amount of work contained in this report and the information and opinions it contains.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Senators have reached differing views on the issues presented and these will be outlined in additional comments. The committee thanks all those who participated in this inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two elements of dispute. Recognising that we are all in agreement on the significant Indigenous cultural value of this particular area and of this particular rock art to not just Australia and Australia's Indigenous people but, I would argue, the history of mankind—as Senator Dodson has remarked, the image of the facial expression is truly remarkable—for our part, coalition senators have focused their contribution on a number of things, particularly the importance of the economic development of the Burrup Peninsula. It is hard to imagine the state of Western Australia in its current form without all the prosperity that's been enjoyed by Western Australian Indigenous and non-Indigenous people as a result of the tremendous amount of economic development in the Burrup Peninsula. That's the first point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point about the committee report is that we made some comments in regards to what we argue is the lack of credible evidence of adverse impacts of emissions on rock art. I'll come to that in a second. We also make some comments in regard to the report by Professor John Black, and that of Mr Rob Gillett. We go on to talk about the adequacy of the existing regulatory approvals and compliance framework. We talk about best practice in monitoring the cultural and heritage value protections, and—if I could be so bold, Senator Dodson, I think this might be what you were alluding to but without specifically referencing them by name, while we do reference them—the conduct of the Friends of Australian Rock Art and the Bob Brown Foundation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't take up too much of the Senate's time, but where the Senate committee is in dispute is around two things. I agree with you, Senator Dodson; the interests of the Murujuga people in regards to the issue of World Heritage listing and the appropriate recognition of this rock art are central. I would argue that, when this inquiry began, that was not of interest to some senators on this committee. That is an area where there must be much greater work and effort because—to use Senator Dodson's words—if we are to give much greater community control and allow for proper, free, prior and informed consent, it may well be that local Indigenous people have their own ideas about the suitability of World Heritage listing of this area. I'd go so far as to say that the interests of the local Indigenous community were initially absent from the committee's consideration or examination of the rock art issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  Senator Siewert, the evidence will be clear. I sat in the Perth hearing when the City of Karratha came and the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation joined us. The other issue—and it's no less insignificant—is that the technical evidence is disputed. If you ever want to see the manufacture of a Greens campaign to undermine industrial development in this country, a Greens campaign to impose World Heritage listing on a particular area of this country, this is a test case. You will see in that report the very heavy disputation around the evidence. I don't want to be unkind to Professor John Black, who does have a very strong history as a very senior official in the CSIRO—but is he a Burrup rock art expert? Is he a rock art expert at all? Even you would have to accept that the answer to that is no.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coalition senators, after very careful consideration—and the technical issues are not issues that are easily understood by senators, who by their very nature have to be jacks-of-all-trades and masters of none—dispute the technical evidence that Professor Black, the Bob Brown Foundation and the Friends of Australian Rock Art are using in regards to this issue. The real danger, if I might say so, is that relying on evidence that lacks credibility, that lacks authority, might in the longer term undermine your argument that this should be preserved—because it should be preserved and great care should be taken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage people to read the Senate committee report. Pay close attention to the fact that the committee does agree on the substantive issue that the rock art is worthy of preservation, but coalition senators very heavily dispute the level of evidence that's been put before the committee. I will quote this to you, if I have the time available, so that people can be very clear about what the coalition's position is on this matter. I'm going to quote from three paragraphs in our additional comments. We say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">CSIRO's final report concluded that a change in the colour characteristics of the rock surfaces had been identified during 13 years of monitoring the rocks, however, there was no statistically significant difference between the two control sites in Dolphin and Gidley islands and the sites close to industrial activity. CSIRO stated:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee was informed by CSIRO that the small changes in the colour characteristics of the rock surfaces could be the results of natural weathering or other causes and that:</span>

                    </a>  It is interesting that in your opening remarks, Senator Siewert, you said that you've got a high regard for the CSIRO, except in this matter. Is that because its findings do not support your particular world view on this issue? The technical evidence will remain a topic of disputation tomorrow, for the next few weeks and for the next few months, and I don't doubt that Professor Black will continue on his campaign, supported by the Friends of Australian Rock Art and the Bob Brown Foundation in trying to do two things: firstly, to secure World Heritage listing, even if some people are not ready to proceed down that path at the moment, which is true of the Aboriginal corporation; and, secondly, to undermine industrial development on the Burrup Peninsula, which brings significant benefits to your state, Senator Siewert, Western Australia, and significant benefits to Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in Western Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been on lots of Senate committee inquiries, and none has made me more incensed than this. But the evidence is there and people can pay very, very close attention. The campaign of the Bob Brown Foundation and the Friends of Australian Rock Art has been exposed. Senator Dodson, 'paternalistic' was the word that the Aboriginal corporation used to describe the attitudes of the Friends of Australian Rock Art. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator LINES:</span>
                    </a>  The Murujuga were not contacted until very late. In attempting to contact the corporation and make my apologies as a senator for Western Australia that they'd failed to be contacted, it took me quite some time—but I was very determined to make that contact. I think that, when you are dealing with first-nations people who live in remote places, you need to make those allowances. In the end, I managed to contact them, and I put my apologies to them on behalf of Labor senators that they had not been contacted or that the secretariat or whoever hadn't made a great attempt at contacting. So I really want to put their perspective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the conclusion of their evidence, they invited all senators to visit the Burrup. I took them up on that invitation to visit the Burrup and to look at the rock art and the site and the sorts of development that they want to see in the Burrup from their perspective. And I have to say that was an amazing visit for me. They welcomed me with open arms. I met with the rangers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They don't want people climbing on the rocks, and certainly, when we went out there, there were people climbing on the rocks. I have to say that I am really ashamed that there is not better protection out there. If one looks at Stonehenge in the UK, it is fenced and has got proper respect. The Burrup's got some old signs that you can barely read. It's got a bit of a history there but not much. You can just go up to the rock and do whatever. You could take pieces of the rock away. So I think that, if we are passionate about the rock art, whilst we come to it from different perspectives in this place, we certainly should pay it better respect than is currently the case. It needs far better protection than it's currently got. It should be fenced. There should be boardwalks. There should be signs respecting the traditional owners' views that the rocks should not be climbed on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rangers there gave me an orientation about the Burrup and their traditional lands. It was quite a different orientation. It had very much a spiritual approach. The rangers were incredibly respectful of the land and at great pains to point out to me that strong cultural link that Senator Dodson referred to in the beginning. They really don't want people visiting the sites without first of all doing the orientation that they presented to me. After we'd done that orientation and I had the opportunity to ask them questions, we went and visited some of that rock art.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I was really privileged to be part of a welcome. When the rangers go to work each day, they speak in language. They speak to the spirits of the place, and they warn them that they're to behave themselves, basically, and that the visitors who are with them are friends and are not going to do any harm. It was an enormous privilege for me, and I thank the Murujuga rangers for taking me on that journey to be part of that welcome, where, in a very stern voice, the head ranger, a traditional owner, warded the spirits off and said we were there to come in peace and to do the work of the day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Later, I was taken to an area of more significance as well. It wasn't covered in our inquiry but again deserves support, recognition and protection. There was a massacre there, and there are a number of headstones that represent the number of first-nations men, women and children who were slaughtered by white colonialists. Again, that's just out there in an open space that you can trample on if you don't know that it's a respected spiritual place. Again, that should be protected. It is acknowledged by first-nations people as a spiritual place of recognition of the slaughter, so that should also be protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Murujuga also want to have economic stability. They want to be able to thrive as a corporation representing those five traditional owner groups, and they want economic independence. They have some really solid plans that are properly thought out about developing a living knowledge centre at Conzinc Bay. I think those plans should be respected. I know that, shortly after my visit, Premier Mark McGowan was going up there. I urge the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation to really put pressure on the Premier to look at how we might get money to set up that living knowledge centre. As Senator Dodson outlined, those rangers don't have control over their lands. They can kind of ask people nicely to move on, but if people don't move on they don't have any powers to move them on. I know that Minister Dawson in the Western Australian government is trying to sort that out and give those rangers real control over the land. On the weekends, young people go screaming through the bush in their utes—and we've all done that, and it can be fun. But as you get older you realise it's not good for the bush, and in a spiritual place like that it's certainly not good and it's not respectful. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The traditional owners believe that, if they can develop this living knowledge centre and if they have a road going in and a road going out, they can start to block off and control some of the other dirt tracks there and stop the free-for-all that's currently going on across their traditional lands. Their plans are well developed. There is a business case behind them. I would urge the WA government and the federal government to look at how, in partnership with the Murujuga corporation, we can make those plans a reality. Around that rock art there's a magnificent story to be told, and it could be told from that living knowledge centre. That would also then create tourist dollars for the Murujuga corporation, which would give them some kind of economic independence. It seems to me that that is a project absolutely worth looking at more seriously and getting some serious dollars behind. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are saying that this rock art is of important value. It is important to First Nations people but it is also important to us. It's a link to civilisation that goes back thousands and thousands of years. So let's make it respectful. Let's fence it, let's put proper boardwalks in, let's detail the history—let's do that with the Murujuga corporation. Senator Smith touched on this in his contribution: the Murujuga corporation are not necessarily opposed to World Heritage; they just want to be consulted. How many times do we hear First Nations people saying to us, 'Sit down and yarn with us,' and that's what they're asking to happen in this place. They want details around that, but I think their primary concerns are getting some better control as rangers across their own lands, getting the living knowledge centre set up to give them independence, in an economic sense, and protecting and recognising from a cultural and spiritual perspective the importance of the Burrup rock art. I commend the Labor report to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a pathetic performance from this minister during question time. I'm not surprised that she was forced to come in here and make a clarification. This minister had not a clue about what she was trying to deal with here, and this is part of this government's attack on what is a reasonable proposition to make sure that people that are getting a dividend imputation have to pay tax. They should not get a tax refund if they have not paid any tax. This is a nonsense position from this government. If you go back to where this started, former Prime Minister John Howard, rolling in cash coming in from the mining boom, was trying to placate every group in the economy and across the country that had a gripe with the then Howard government by throwing money at them. That's exactly where this dividend imputation rort came in.</span>

You understand that this was a John Howard rort that we are trying to fix and will fix in government because we are concerned to make sure that we've got enough funding for hospitals, health, education and infrastructure.

This is a government, as I've said before, that is in terminal decline and a government that doesn't understand what the key issues are for working people in this country. They just don't get it. Senator Fierravanti-Wells comes in here, completely out of her depth at question time, is incapable of giving a proper response and then has to suffer the humiliation of coming back in here and saying that she'd got it wrong. The government have got this wrong. The government have got their whole position on dividend imputation completely wrong. They keep saying that this is about pensioners. This is predominantly about self-funded superannuants who are getting tax refunds for tax that they never paid. That was never, ever the reason why dividend imputation was introduced, and former Prime Minister Paul Keating has been clear and unequivocal about that position. The Grattan Institute has clearly belled the cat when it comes to the coalition trying to misrepresent the position, and again we have Senator Fierravanti-Wells coming in here misrepresenting the position and trying to indicate that poor people are suffering because of the proper policy that Labor has introduced on dividend imputation. Senator Fierravanti-Wells is completely out of her depth and is just making statements that are wrong.</span>

This is simply another example of a government that will say anything and do anything to try and mislead the public. You're in so much trouble that you can't even get prepared answers correct when you come to question time. You've got a frontbench who don't understand the key issues for ordinary Australians in this country, don't understand the need for a good education, don't understand the need for a decent health system and don't understand that you can't keep throwing money at people who don't deserve it. You can't keep throwing money at people who don't need it. You should actually be putting money into the key issues that are important for building a decent society and a decent economy in this country—and they are education, health and dealing with inequality.</span>

He would not have a clue, and if he had a clue then he would not be going down the track of continuing what was a rort by John Howard and by the weakest, worst Treasurer we've ever had in this country in Peter Costello—a Treasurer that was too weak to stand up to a Prime Minister that wanted to throw money out to the richest in the country just to make sure he got their vote at the election.</span>

Where is the sense in that? Commentators around the country have got you guys well and truly picked on this. This is just an absolute rort that you are engaging in. There is absolutely no economic sense at all in what you are doing. You claim to be the party of economic responsibility, the grown-up party.

                  <a href="245212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:59</span>):  I also seek to take note of the ministerial statement. I do not seek to delay the work of the chamber, but there were a number of misrepresentations and simple mistruths aired by Senator Cameron that I believe require correction. The first point to make concerns the clear mistruth that is presented here by the Labor Party that somehow people should be made to pay tax twice. The refunds are provided to hardworking Australians who invest their money, often in Australian companies—in this case, they have to be Australian companies they invest in to get franking credits. They should not be made to pay tax twice. That should be a basic principle. We don't believe that people should be made to pay tax twice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, the Labor Party think twice is not enough—they should be made to pay three times, four times, five times—because Labor constantly need more money to fund their ever-expanding schemes to waste your money. We're on the side of people who work and save and invest in this country. That's why we believe they should be able to keep some of their money in their pockets to provide for themselves in their retirement. The Labor Party see anybody's savings as a big nest egg for them to raid, and that is what they are trying to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point to make is: Senator Cameron is saying that this particular policy, which has now been in place for almost 20 years, is somehow a rort. If what Senator Cameron just said was half-true, even one-quarter true, why did the Labor Party, in their six years in government in the intervening 20-year period, do nothing to fix this rort? Mr Shorten was in fact the Assistant Treasurer for periods of time in that six years and apparently did nothing to fix this, according to Senator Cameron, obvious rort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting">Senator Cameron interjecting</span>—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245212" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CANAVAN:</span>
                  </a>  That exactly shows the bankruptcy of the point you are making, Senator Cameron, because in your time in government you did nothing. What you have seen now in opposition is a need to fund your ever-expanding spending promises to the Australian people. At the last election, you didn't have enough money to fund them; you were $16 billion in the red for them. Now you need to raid people's piggy banks to fund the schemes you want to waste people's money on. We don't think that people's retirement savings are there for the Labor Party to come and raid when they run out of their own money. That is not what people should have to work and save and invest for. They should be able to provide for their own retirement themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally—and I don't want to delay the chamber long here—we see now an opposition clearly not ready for government. We already see in the newspapers and the press that the policy, this major tax reform, according to the opposition, which it put out only a couple of weeks ago, is about to be changed. My colleague Senator Di Natale made the point earlier today in the chamber that the opposition is about to change its own policy. The policy has lasted just two weeks. It's clearly not an opposition ready for government, because it can't even get a simple policy announcement right. This is clearly a first draft for the Labor Party. It is a first draft of tax reform. It is not an opposition that is ready for government, and you can't trust an opposition that can't get the simple things right with the government's finances, with the Treasury benches. It obviously needs more time to get its act together, because it's about to change and dump a major tax reform that's only been in place for two weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, the Labor Party should join with others in this chamber to adopt real tax reform, which actually means trying to lower the tax burden on Australian businesses and families and lower corporate taxes, like we are trying to do here, to try and encourage more investment, more savings, better business conditions, more wealth, more prosperity and more job opportunities for all Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DT6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BARTLETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:03</span>):  I think it's an important debate that we're having here today, and it is important to ensure that the facts are fully out on the table. I welcome Senator Cameron's contribution and the continuing signs, intermittent as they are, that the Labor Party is gradually following the Greens' lead in addressing unjust tax measures in this country and reducing inequality, particularly wealth inequality. It was correct of Senator Cameron to point to the various measures, including the franking credits measure, that came in during the John Howard era. As he said, they were decisions John Howard made many years ago. But it is worth noting that these weren't just decisions of John Howard and the Liberal government; they were decisions of the Senate. These measures had to pass the parliament, and these measures were supported by the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the minister, reasonably enough, just pointed out, the Labor Party had six years in government and didn't address this problem of a measure that clearly excessively benefits those who are the wealthiest. But the Labor Party also, of course, supported the measure coming in in the first place, as the Labor Party did with other John Howard measures, like the capital gains tax discount. Going back to the Hawke-Keating era, negative gearing was briefly abolished by that government and then restored by that government. There are the problems we are seeing now with increased casualisation and wage stagnation under Labor's Fair Work Act. And, of course, there was the privatisation regime that was followed by both Labor and Liberal. All of these things have contributed to growing inequality. It is pleasing to see Labor following the Greens, partially at least, on things like addressing, partially at least, the problem with negative gearing and the massive impact of that, combined with the capital gains tax discount—which Labor also supported being put in place in the Senate 15 or more years ago. That has caused a huge problem with housing affordability in this country. It's good to see some measures slowly being put in place to address that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Di Natale made clear in this chamber earlier on today, the Greens support measures to reduce some of the tax loopholes, the tax breaks, that inappropriately favour those who are the wealthiest—clearly regressive tax measures. Anything the Labor Party puts forward that does that effectively we will certainly support. Let's not forget that many of these measures—and others such as the private health insurance rebate, which is billions of dollars in forgone revenue that goes to people who are on the wealthiest end of the spectrum—need to be wound back. These are all measures that the Greens have unequivocally opposed, and ones that, unfortunately, have been inconsistently addressed by the Labor Party. With regard to the Liberals, as Senator Cameron rightly pointed out repeatedly, the Liberal-National Party will do what they can to favour those at the top end of the wealth spectrum. They have made a key contribution to the continual increase in wealth inequality in this country. I just wanted to put on the record the Greens' unequivocal and continuing support for addressing the tax loopholes, the tax measures and the tax breaks—in superannuation and in other areas—that clearly are regressive and clearly contribute to growing inequality in this country. We will continue to push forward measures that address that and we will support them when others put them forward as well.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:09</span>):  As I was saying when I finished off earlier today, we were talking about the fact that corporations are not vehicles for social change; corporations are vehicles for delivering profit to shareholders. Corporations exist to deliver profit for their shareholders. They put the public interest ahead of that only when government forces them to do so. It's a bit like the parable of the scorpion and the frog: 'It's in my nature.' The nature of corporations is that they are institutions that exist to deliver profit for shareholders. There is no real-world evidence to show that company tax cuts increase jobs and wages growth. The idea that giving a huge handout to large and profitable companies will somehow lead to that handout finding its way not into increased profits but into the hands of working people is laughable. In fact, most of the real-world evidence demonstrates that company tax cuts flow overwhelmingly to the owners of businesses in the form of high dividends and share buybacks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We actually have a real-world example going on right now. Let's look at the example of the corporate tax cuts that have been dished out in the US. We hear a lot about US company tax cuts and how much has flowed to workers. Yes, $5.6 billion flowed to workers—much of it in the form of one-off bonuses, it must be said, not sustained wage increases. But that compares to $171 billion in stock buybacks over the same period. So only a tiny fraction of the huge benefit given to those corporations through company tax cuts found its way into the pockets of ordinary workers. It has lined the pockets of shareholders. So far, the US example is actually in keeping with other evidence across the world. Company tax cuts flow to the owners of those businesses; they don't flow to the workers. They flow to the wealthiest people, not the poorest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's the poorest people who are feeling the impact of government budget cuts. Economics 101 tells you that if you're taking money from the poor, who spend all of their income, to give it to the rich, who save a significant part of their income, that's going to be a drag on economic growth. Pushing down spending on consumption will do nothing for employment and wages growth. It just doesn't work that way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's get our heads around this: a third of the benefits of the government's proposed tax cuts are going to go to 15 businesses. Who are those businesses? There are the big four banks. The big four banks alone are going to get $7.4 billion from these tax cuts. At the moment we have a royal commission looking at the culture and behaviour of the big four banks, and Malcolm Turnbull is saying, 'Here you go; have another $7½ billion.' It's not just the big four banks. There are a number of other resource companies and the two big supermarkets, all of whom are large oligopolies with extensive market power. They have little or no interest in investing in their companies beyond lowering costs so they can further increase dividend payments to their owners. We had a business group today saying, hand on heart, 'We promise to invest in Australia if the Senate passes these company tax cuts.' What does investing mean? It could mean things like investing in ATMs. That was a big investment from the banks. Internet banking was a big investment. Self-service checkouts were big investments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These were huge initiatives by big business. They did nothing to increase employment. They might have improved efficiency, but how does having ATMs at banks increase employment? It may have increased the profits of the big four banking companies. It might have made them more efficient, but it doesn't increase the amount of jobs and it doesn't increase the wages of employees in those businesses. In fact, it was the opposite. One Nation claim to be the party of battlers, but what they're proposing to do is give a third of the benefits to 15 companies, who are going to be the biggest beneficiaries of this massive taxpayer largess. Fifteen companies are going to get one-third of the dividend from this massive corporate tax cut. We mentioned the big four banks; the supermarkets Coles and Woolies; and Telstra. These are the businesses that the government want to look after.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know they're the party of big business, but what about One Nation? One Nation say they stand for battlers: 'Here you go; have $7½ billion, NAB and Commonwealth Bank.' They say they're ashamed about the banking culture that exists in Australia, and here we are: a massive, massive handout. These are the businesses that One Nation think are somehow magically going to grow employment and lift wages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this company tax cut is really about increasing employment and wages, there are a hell of a lot of far better ways of spending $65 billion to get an employment boost. How about this: how about spending it on schools; how about improving people's health? How about we get better productivity and a society that's better educated and healthier? That's a good start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the largest benefits that the government-commissioned economic modelling predicted was a decrease in tax avoidance by large businesses. Well, let's follow that logic. The company tax rate for avoided tax is zero. Whether the tax rate's 30 per cent or 25 per cent or even 15 per cent, businesses are still going to try to avoid tax. That's an argument for having a zero tax rate. The government have got to spend more time cracking down on people who are avoiding paying tax. They've got to empower the ATO. There are a range of other things that they can do to make sure that these multinational tax avoiders start paying their fair share of tax, rather than giving up and saying, 'Well, there's a problem with tax avoidance, so we're going to reduce the company tax rate.' Based on that logic, let's bring it down to zero!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the Turnbull government say: 'Well, we've got to be internationally competitive. We've got to cut our taxes because other countries, like the US, are doing it.' Who on earth wants to compete with the US, the lowest common denominator—with Donald Trump? Do we want to be pursuing his policy agenda? Of course, that's just a race to the bottom. Do we keep cutting taxes until our tax rate is zero, until we lack the revenue to invest in education and health care?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again and again, this government tells us that investment in Australia will boom if only we cut the company tax rate. But we know from the evidence—it's absolutely clear—that there is no link between increased investment and cutting the company tax rate. Businesses invest in Australia for all sorts of reasons. They do it because of our stable political environment. They do it because of the business environment. They don't do it because of a headline company tax rate. It's only one factor amongst many. Most of the foreign investment that comes to Australia is from countries with lower company tax rates than ours. That's the irony.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And of course these tax cuts won't lead to economic growth if they're paid for by cutting government spending. Taking money—I say it again—from low-income Australians and giving it to wealthy corporations is going to reduce growth, not increase it, and that's particularly true at a time of wage stagnation. The finance minister's fond of talking about how Australia's company tax compares to the rest of the world. He's pointed out that, among countries with high company taxes, one is Germany. Germany's got a very strong and growing economy. It's driven not by resources but by manufacturing. If manufacturing's not just surviving in Germany but thriving with a high company tax rate, it's obvious there are so many other factors that go into business investment decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are committed to opposing these company tax cuts. We stand in opposition to big business getting an even sweeter deal at the expense of ordinary Australians. Our challenge right now is to address growing inequality, not contribute to it. It seems the government is bending over backwards to exacerbate the growing divide in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time to end government handouts—huge handouts like fossil fuel subsidies. It's time to crack down on loopholes that benefit big business and the wealthy, like the capital gains tax discount and negative gearing. It's time to make sure corporations start paying tax, rather than seeking to give them a big handout. And it's long overdue that this government—and indeed the crossbench, along with its big-business crony—opposes the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017 and starts working on the foundations of a decent society, one where we recognise that tax is the price we pay for a civilised society, decent health care, decent education and a productive workforce, and one where inequality starts to reduce rather than continues to grow.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on Labor's big new tax on retirees—the changes to the dividend imputation system that have been proposed by Labor which will hit the retirement incomes of pensioners and self-funded retirees in what is a shameless tax grab. It's a $59 billion tax hit that will hurt one million Australians. One million Australians will be worse off as a result of this massive tax grab. According to the ATO, more than half of franking credit refunds were paid by individuals over the age of 65; 97 per cent had an income of less than $87,000; 86 per cent had an income of less than $37,000; and more than half had an income below $18,200. These are not high-income Australians; these are very modestly-living Australians on very modest incomes. Labor's tax grab will strip away vital income from many, many low-income earners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cameron, in his contribution earlier, said that these people don't deserve this dividend imputation. I'm going to speak briefly to a letter I have a copy of here concerning one of those individuals who apparently don't deserve it—but I'll get to that in a moment. Labor tells us that these people shouldn't receive a refund because they haven't paid any tax, but that is just so patently false. The dividend imputation system was designed to ensure that tax is not paid twice on the same income. This is a key fact. Double taxation is wrong. Double taxation is unfair. The fact that we are even talking about double taxation again shows just how far backwards this Labor opposition has gone in its economic thinking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is proposing to slug low-income earners with the full corporate tax rate even if they don't earn enough to pay tax on their regular income. That is shameful. This is not a concession. As former Treasury secretary John Stone stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is not a tax loophole or anything like this. This is a case where companies have paid tax, they've paid tax. They pay a dividend with a franking credit and if somebody doesn't have other tax liabilities to offset that, they're entitled to get the difference in cash. That is completely fair. It's been the case for nearly 20 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian tax system is built on the simple principle that double taxation is inefficient and inequitable. Let's put it even more simply: double taxation is wrong. Taxing money twice is completely unfair. It's as unfair as retrospectivity and it's as unfair as death duties. I, along with many hundreds of thousands of hardworking Australians, believed that those ideas had been consigned to the dustbin of history. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Once again, we have seen this issue rear its ugly head. We have seen double taxation back on the agenda, and it's something that we must ensure never sees the light of day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the minute I have left I want to return to the comment from Senator Cameron about how these Australians don't deserve it. I will tell you the story of Glenn, a chap from Albany in Western Australia, who worked hard all his life and is a self-funded retiree. He is not a wealthy man, by any means. He was a teacher in the Department of Education for 40 years and he had a very modest self-managed super fund. When he retired it was around $500,000. Through some losses suffered during the global financial crisis, that reduced to around $350,000. He derives from that an income of around $33,000 per annum, $10,000 of which comes from dividend imputation. If Labor's policy goes ahead then this man, who has worked hard all his life, has looked after himself, aimed to be self-funded in retirement, doesn't take a pension, doesn't take a part-pension, doesn't want to take a part-pension— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  It's pretty clear from what we have seen from those opposite that a scare campaign is underway. I'd normally try and expect better from Western Australian senators, as we see from the current Acting Deputy President, Senator Sterle. But it really is disappointing that we see Senator Brockman following the path of the Prime Minister. The best the government can do in regard to this issue is mount a scare campaign, lame one that it is. A scare campaign is all that it is. The Prime Minister was out there doing that today in New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what I wanted to talk about and what today really highlights is just what the priorities of this government are. We know that they're pursuing a scare campaign on this issue, but they're also running around behind this scenes in this place at the moment trying to secure their ideological agenda around tax cuts for big business. On the one hand they're running a scare campaign about Labor's fair and responsible measures around tax and then, on the other hand, they're going around the crossbench trying to get the numbers to pass a bill that would result in tax cuts for big business. They're hoodwinking the crossbench, saying they'll provide a letter from the Business Council of Australia to provide some certainty to them. It's just absolutely ridiculous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at what Labor has been talking about today and what the Labor leader has been up to compared to what the Prime Minister has been up to, Labor has been highlighting the health cuts that are coming from this government. What this government has put to the state governments around COAG would result in a $710 million cut to the health budget between now and 2020. That means for Queensland a $160 million cut. This would have a devastating impact on the Queensland community. This is also on top of what is looming around the GST cuts as well, which we know would have a devastating impact when it comes to health and education. But this is the government's priority. So, at one level, it's focusing in on tax cuts, whilst at the same time it's cutting funding to health. We know what the government did in regard to education. We know what they have done in regard to infrastructure. But this is the focus that we are seeing from them. This means a $160 million cut to Queensland, which would result in 240,000 emergency department visits being cut at a time when a record number of people are actually presenting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the real concern for me is in regional Queensland. We know that the health outcomes in regional Queensland are not as good as those in the capital cities, so any cut that is made to the health budget has a devastating impact in regional communities. People there are already having to travel long distances for treatment, especially for specialist treatment. The fact that there are more cuts to those regional areas looming is going to have a significant impact. So it was absolutely the right call for federal Labor leader Bill Shorten to be highlighting today these cuts in Central Queensland, including Gladstone. What Malcolm Turnbull's cut would mean for Central Queensland is that $6.1 million would be cut from public hospitals. This would mean $950,000 cut from the Gladstone Hospital. This would means surgeries would be delayed, nurse and doctor numbers would decline and emergency department wait times would increase in Central Queensland. This is what we are seeing in regional Queensland. This is the pursuit of those opposite, whilst at the same time they are pursuing tax cuts for big business. We will absolutely campaign strongly on this issue, and we are determined—and this has been a Labor mantra—that your Medicare card will be worth more than your credit card. We absolutely want to ensure that everyone in Queensland has access to the best possible health care that they can afford. We will continue to highlight that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This also goes to what we have seen consistently from the Liberal and National parties across Australia and particularly the Liberal National Party in Queensland. We know that from their time in government in Queensland, from 2012 to 2015. Queensland is only just starting to recover from the cuts they made to health now that we've had three years of a state Labor government. But the work that they have done in Queensland has had to be on their own because they haven't had support from the federal government to boost that funding that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, we will continue to highlight the priorities of those opposite compared to our priorities. It becomes clear that we want to ensure that big business pays their fair share of tax and that the health outcomes for everyone in Queensland and across Australia are equal. We also want to do the same with education. We will stand proudly by our record while campaigning across Queensland communities to ensure that they understand this. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Of course, we saw that in the state election in my own state of Queensland. Despite the valiant efforts, which stretched over, literally, many months, by my colleague Senator Siewert and other Greens to stop a whole raft of cuts to people on low incomes and people on income support, the welfare reform bill got through the Senate earlier today, courtesy of the Liberals-One Nation alliance. On the same day, we got moves towards the likelihood of huge tax cuts—as in more money—going to the big corporations. Again, it seems likely, as another example of One Nation teaming up with the Liberal Party. The final bill that the Senate passed today will mean greater poverty for thousands of Australians, putting them in greater hardship and greater uncertainty, and under extra pressure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We already have one of the toughest jobseeker compliance regimes in the OECD, but now job agencies will find it even easier to dock jobseekers up to a month's pay for a variety of reasons. The government has boasted that this new demerit system that'll impose significant financial penalties on some of the poorest people in our community—including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people who need assistance the most—will save just $204 million over four years. At the same time, they're begging the Senate and cajoling One Nation to agree to provide tens of billions of dollars in handouts to the biggest corporations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that this government is in an alliance with One Nation, which likes to talk about supporting the battlers but seems happy to bash the battlers whenever they get a chance, and increase that growing gap between the wealthiest and the poorest. By restricting access to payments and introducing even more brutal demerit systems, we will see people pushed further into a cycle of poverty and welfare dependency. As we all know, we have a situation where we have significant wage stagnation in this country—for people on the lowest incomes in particular. As pretty much every economist will tell you, if you want to boost that economic activity, you need to be providing more support and more income to those on the lowest incomes. It will flow straight back into retail and other sectors in the economy. We know that there are already three million people living below the poverty line in Australia—13 per cent of the population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be increasing the amount that people receive on Newstart. The decline in the real value of Newstart over many years now is an absolute scandal. As we know as well, for people on the minimum wage and people on low incomes, the value of their wage has gone backwards at the same time as the cost of housing and energy—electricity—in many areas has skyrocketed. The costs of health care, education and transport have gone above the CPI, but the wages for low-income earners is stagnating or going backwards in real terms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a significant homelessness problem in Australia. In Queensland alone there are more homeless people than there are empty houses, and that's just in my own city of Brisbane. These cuts to people on low income will push more people out on the streets. Let's be clear about that. There's a direct linkage. If you cut people's income, particularly if they're already low-income earners, then you almost certainly will see some of them out on the streets. You'll see some of them losing their homes, particularly with the inadequate protections that we have for renters in most states around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the Greens' point of view, we will be continuing to push to ensure that people on lower incomes get more support, whether it's by increasing Newstart or by reforming our industrial relations laws to prevent increasing casualisation and misuse of contract labour, because that wage stagnation is even worse for people who are on casual work or on contract work. It's time to turn around that wealth and income inequality in this country. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="247512" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KITCHING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  Today, I want to discuss one of the most important questions which confronts us: how can Australia as a democratic state defend its institutions against the rising tide of authoritarianism, corruption and criminality which we see now in so many countries? In Australia, debate around this question has focused mainly on our complex relationship with China, but today I want to talk about another authoritarian power, Russia—and we saw the results from their election on the weekend. Taking advantage of the preferential sale of state assets, President Putin's cronies have amassed huge profits, which they have then shifted offshore by investing in foreign business and property. Anyone who challenges or investigates this corrupt system can expect harassment, arrest, prosecution and imprisonment on bogus charges, or even murder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among the many victims of Putin's regime has been Sergei Magnitsky, a tax lawyer who died in police custody in 2009 after being tortured and denied medical care. Magnitsky was investigating corruption on behalf of Bill Browder, a US-British hedge fund manager. Browder had once been a major investor in Russia and a supporter of Putin but was barred from the country in 2005 after opposing corruption. Browder felt personally responsible for Magnitsky's death, and he has spent the last nine years campaigning for Western countries to take action against the spreading tentacles of Russian corruption. In 2016, the US congress passed the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. This act empowers the US President to impose visa and property related sanctions on foreign persons who are responsible for violations of human rights and also against those 'who have materially assisted, sponsored or resourced significant corruption'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill Browder has not rested after achieving this success. He has broadened his campaign, urging all democracies to adopt a local version of the Magnitsky act. To date, the UK, Canada, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have adopted Magnitsky-style provisions into their domestic laws. This week, Bill Browder has made a direct appeal to Australia to join these countries. On Monday, he was quoted as saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, but so far has not for human rights atrocities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This puts Australia out of sync with allies like the US, Canada and the UK who all have Magnitsky Acts in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">By not being in sync with other allied countries Australia creates a perverse incentive for bad people to come to Australia and keep their blood money in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has Australia's response been to this appeal? On ABC Radio National last week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We keep the structure of our sanction regime under regular view, and at present we're considering what further action may or will be necessary in the light of this recent attempted assassination using a military grade nerve agent developed by Russia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my experience, when a minister says that something is 'being kept under review', that means that they actually have no plans to do very much at all. I don't think that's good enough. As we have seen in the US, the ambitions of the Putin regime to extend its influence into the democracies, to find the weak spots in our institutions and to exploit them, is a real and growing threat to all democratic states, including Australia. We need to consider as a matter of urgency how we respond to that threat. We already have provisions in our laws, such as the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act, to apply sanctions to foreign individuals who are engaged in corrupt or criminal behaviour or in abuses of human rights. But these laws do not have the broad reach of the Magnitsky acts and nor do they have the moral impact of an act specifically aimed at the Putin regime or indeed any totalitarian or authoritarian regime and its corrupt elite. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we are seeing from events in the US and Europe, the penetration of the Russian state and the corrupt Russian elite into the affairs of democracies is an urgent matter. It requires both a strong and an urgent response. I urge the government and indeed all political parties represented in this parliament to give serious and immediate consideration to developing a Magnitsky-style legislative response to this real and increasing threat.</span>
