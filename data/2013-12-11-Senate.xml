It is proper that the parliament and the Australian people are informed about major military operations where our men and women are in harm's way. Today I will provide an update on the completion of the Australian mission in Uruzgan province and progress in the transition of security responsibility to the Afghan National Security Forces in Afghanistan. I also intend to address Australia's strong ongoing commitment to Afghanistan throughout 2014.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian operations in Uruzgan province are drawing to a close. On Tuesday, 3 December 2013, the Commander of the International Security Assistance Force Regional Command South, Major General Paul LaCamera, announced that the Afghan National Security Forces have assumed responsibility for security in Uruzgan province. Over the coming weeks the Australian Defence Force will complete its mission in Uruzgan and the majority of our people will return to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 28 October, I was privileged to travel to Afghanistan with our Prime Minister to be present at the recognition ceremony at Multinational Base—Tarin Kot in Uruzgan province. The ceremony was also attended by the Leader of the Opposition in a show of bipartisan support for the achievements of our men and women in Afghanistan. As is only right, both sides of parliament have been consistent in Australia's support to the mission in Afghanistan, and our long-term commitment to the people of Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ceremony formally acknowledged the contribution and sacrifice of Australia and our coalition partners to the ISAF mission in Afghanistan and particularly in Uruzgan province. What we have achieved in Uruzgan would not have been possible without the support of our international partners, including our traditional partner the United States and our NATO partners, particularly the Netherlands and Slovakia. We have also been assisted by our regional partner Singapore, which provided valuable support to the mission in Uruzgan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Key to the success in that province, and Afghanistan more broadly, has been the role and support provided, of course, by the mighty United States. Australia and the United States forces have worked side by side and we have embedded ADF personnel in ISAF and United States based headquarters for some long time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to recognising the efforts of ISAF members, the ceremony in Tarin Kot was an opportunity to recognise the achievements of the Afghan National Security Forces since we have been in that province. Over the past 16 months, Afghan National Security Forces have taken the security lead in the province. During this period, insurgent efforts to undermine security in Uruzgan have been countered by well-led and increasingly proficient Afghan National Security Forces. Their continuing success is a direct result of the training and mentoring provided by the Australian Defence Force, and other coalition partners, which have helped the Afghan National Army 4th Brigade develop as a capable force.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Supporting this have been successive detachments of the Australian Special Operations Task Group, which have partnered with elements of the Afghan National Security Forces, to deny the influence of the insurgency and to protect the population, thus giving the Afghan government breathing space to progress its own development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister said during his address at the recognition ceremony in Tarin Kot: we have done very good work in Uruzgan. This work has been a whole-of-government effort carried out by the ADF and the Australian Federal Police as well as civilians from Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs who have come together on this difficult task.

In 2014, around 400 ADF personnel will continue to be engaged in Afghanistan through training and advising the Afghan National Security Forces in Kabul and in Kandahar. Through to the end of 2014, Australia will provide instructors, advisers and support staff to the UK-led Afghan National Army Officer Academy in Kabul, which will include a force protection platoon.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our personnel in these roles will continue the important process of building the capability of the Afghan National Security Forces to take full security responsibility for their own country. In doing so, they will also continue to face personal danger and risks from the ongoing Taliban insurgency which will continue to seek to undermine Afghan security. The government is committed to continuing to provide our personnel with the protection and equipment they will need to do their jobs.</span>

In 2000, there were 1.2 million students enrolled in schools across Afghanistan; there are now over 10 million students enrolled in schools throughout Afghanistan. Nearly 40 per cent of school-age girls—that is roughly three million—are enrolled in school. Female voting participation rate is currently at 40 per cent. Over the last 10 years, Afghanistan has improved most out of all countries on the United Nations development index. So it is important to note that Afghanistan has come a very long way over the last decade.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking beyond 2014, the international community will remain committed to Afghanistan. At the Chicago NATO/ISAF summit in May 2012, the international community renewed a firm commitment to a sovereign, secure and democratic Afghanistan. Leaders acknowledged that beyond the end of the transition period, NATO and Afghanistan will work to establish a new NATO-led mission to train, advise, and assist the Afghan national defence and security forces.</span>

In 2014, we will turn our attention to national-level support and we will remain committed to supporting security in Afghanistan.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">NATO and partners have commenced planning for a Status of Forces Agreement with Afghanistan in order to provide the legal framework for the post-2014 mission. NATO has the lead for negotiating a Status of Forces Agreement with the Afghan government for its post-2014 NATO-led mission and any foreign forces operating in Afghanistan post next year would need to do so under appropriate legal arrangements. Obviously, indemnities and other things for our personnel are very important.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I want to again echo the words of our Prime Minister during his address to our troops in Afghanistan: we have done good work. It has been a very difficult commitment. But still, to be able to help our allies, defend our national interests and uphold our values is just about the best thing that any Australian can do, particularly any Australian soldier.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth of the matter is that the Australian Defence Force's sacrifices and those of the Afghans, the United States and other ISAF partners have bought time for the Afghan security forces to build and field a force able to take full security responsibility for their own country. It is now up to the Afghans to take the lead, with the international community supporting them. The efforts of over 26,500 men and women of the ADF who have served in Afghanistan since 2002 have made this possible.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our people have paid a high price for our achievements in that country—261 Australians have been wounded during our mission. We have lost 40 of our best. We mourn them. Their families and friends mourn them. We continue to work with their families to support them on their road to recovery. We are better positioned than we have ever been to assist them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Together with Veterans' Affairs, we have built resilience programs and services to continue to assist families of our wounded and we continue to work with the families of our fallen soldiers to provide assistance to them where we can. I was with the families of our 40 fallen in Perth airport as they flew out to attend the closing ceremony at Tarin Kot. I thank CDF General Hurley for providing that opportunity to the families of our 40 fallen. It was a ceremony that was appreciated, solemn and well received by those family members.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">These operations, which are widespread and ongoing, have provided an increased level of freedom and security for the Afghan population in the province, and have given the Afghan government the ability to expand its presence at the local level, enhancing public confidence both in the Afghan National Security Forces and the Afghan government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

It is appropriate that the minister is doing so and doing so frankly. He is right to stress with the parliament that the welfare of our service men and women is uppermost in our minds, as the ISAF mission in Afghanistan evolves and changes in a very fundamental way.</span>

Forty Australian soldiers have made the supreme sacrifice in Afghanistan. Those sacrifices must never be forgotten. It remains and will remain a great responsibility of this parliament to ensure the welfare of those returning from Afghanistan, particularly the 261 Australians who have been wounded in the service of our nation. I suspect that in the future many others will bear the marks of their service in Afghanistan. We must always keep uppermost in our minds that we have a responsibility to those returning servicemen and -women and their families. I know that that sentiment is shared on both sides of the parliament. It is a responsibility that we must meet into the future.</span>

The sacrifices they make are immense and I acknowledge them today. I was heartened to hear the minister express the government's commitment to looking after our returned troops and their families, including the 261 personnel injured in Afghanistan. As the minister acknowledged, we have made substantial progress in recent years but this important work is never finished. We must continually strive to improve the way we look after ADF members and their families. I am sure the minister knows that he enjoys universal support for this endeavour. </span>

In recent years, the ADF has worked closely with the Afghan National Army to improve their capability so that they can take on the responsibility for protecting their people and their government. In both of these missions, we have been remarkably successful. The Afghans can now field effective combat forces and, while there will no doubt be setbacks in the future, I am confident that our troops have given the Afghans every chance to build a stable and prosperous country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While there is still much work to do, Afghanistan has improved significantly in recent years. Australian personnel have built or reconstructed schools, hospitals, medical centres and more than 200 kilometres of roads near Oruzgan province. This is part of a reconstruction effort across Afghanistan, which has transformed the country. As the minister mentioned, school enrolments have gone from 1.2 million to 10 million, including 40 per cent of school-aged girls. Life expectancy has gone from 37 in 2000 to 56 now. And much of the important infrastructure is improving, from airports and bridges to internet and mobile phone coverage. So, as announced by the Labor government in March, the time is right for us to transition into a new phase of our mission in Afghanistan. This decision is in line with an agreement in Lisbon in 2010 between ISAF countries and the Afghan government to adopt a conditioned based approach to transition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But our important work in Afghanistan is not complete. As agreed in Chicago in May 2012, Australia and other ISAF countries will continue to support the Afghan National Army with training and support after the transition period. To support this agreement, Australia will continue to base 400 ADF personnel in Afghanistan after the transition. Seventy of those troops will be based at the Afghan National Army Officer Academy, where they will continue to pass on their professionalism, skill and anti-insurgency knowledge to our Afghan counterparts. This is an important contribution that we can make now and into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Strong and competent leadership of the ANA will ensure that they remain a vital link in the global effort to stamp out militant extremism around the world. It is also important that Australia and our allies continue to support the Afghan-led peace and reconciliation process. This process will be long and complex, but it will be a core component of a lasting peace in Afghanistan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the ADF transitions out of Afghanistan, it gives us an opportunity to look to the future. I recently read comments made by General Hurley in his address to the 125th anniversary of the Royal United Services Institute of New South Wales held here, in Parliament House. He stressed the importance of training 'hard' and training 'excellently' when our personnel are not deployed. He noted that, despite not being deployed between 1975 and 1990, we had a defence force that could perform with the best of them when they were called upon to serve in Somalia and Rwanda in the nineties. It is now time for Defence to reset itself and remain vigilant for future challenges. We must always be ready for what is next. I have every faith that the Australian Defence Force has the people, the equipment, the know-how and the spirit to make that happen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I conclude, it is important to reflect on what our deployment in Afghanistan has meant for our alliance with the United States. I believe that our joint deployment in Afghanistan reflects our ongoing commitment to work closely with the United States, to further the interests of democracy, freedom and human rights around the globe. We must ensure that our shared values continue to shape our great friendship—a friendship which has underpinned the stability of our region for decades. The minister was absolutely right to highlight the support provided by the United States to our troops in Afghanistan and the key role that it played in our success. Working side by side with US troops in Afghanistan and across the region has had some very tangible benefits for our service men and women, and it is something I know the ADF is looking to build on in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I thank the minister for taking this opportunity to update the Senate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="ka5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MILNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:55)</span>  by leave—I thank the Minister for Defence for his update on progress on the withdrawal from Afghanistan and pay tribute to the 40 service people from Australia who have lost their lives in Afghanistan. I want to extend our sympathy to their families and of course offer our support to the 261 who have been wounded in action and to all of the service men and women who have returned and are coming back from Afghanistan. The Australian Greens absolutely honour your contribution to our nation, and we commit to supporting you on your return. Mental health issues are very real and need to be addressed, and the Australian Greens will be here to support whatever efforts are needed to look after families, those who have been wounded and those who are suffering as a result of their engagement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I need to point out that when you consider a war you need to think about what has been achieved, why we were there and who made the decision to go—because people lost their lives. The Greens did not oppose Australia joining military action under the auspices of the United Nations in Afghanistan in 2001 following the horrific September 11 2001 attacks. Like so many others, we hoped that swift military intervention under the auspices of the UN to capture and bring to justice the leaders of Al Qaeda could help make the world a safer place and prevent the loss of so many more lives. But we did not support the withdrawal in 2002 and the redeployment to Iraq and then the lost opportunities in Afghanistan, or the 2005-06 redeployment of the Special Forces to Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over that period we have sent men and women to risk their lives, but the reason they were there was never clear after 2005 and 2006. Mission creep with no clear outcome was the result. Major General Cantwell says in his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Exit Wounds</span>:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… we need to have a crystal clear understanding of why we're getting into the fight, how long for, what we hope to achieve, how we will leave, and what conditions might prompt us to change strategy—this has let us down in Afghanistan. Human beings die as a result of warfare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point he is clearly making is not that our troops have not done us proud—they absolutely have in Afghanistan and we thank them for it—but that responsibility lies with parliaments and with governments. From the beginning of the conflict in Afghanistan we in the Australian Greens were calling for a parliamentary debate on our deployment. It was nine years from when the government of John Howard first committed our forces in September 2001 until the parliament officially debated our deployment, in October 2010. That is not good enough. If we are to honour and truly respect the sacrifices that our troops make, we have to be very clear about why they are being deployed and we should have the support of the parliament, not just the government of the day, in committing those troops.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Major General Cantwell asked the hard question, 'Is it worth it?' He went on to talk about that in some depth:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But will our efforts, no matter how impressive locally, significantly influence the myriad problems afflicting the government and people of Afghanistan? Ten years from now, will anyone in Afghanistan remember that Australians shed blood for them? For a man like me, a lifetime soldier inculcated with a sense of duty and service, these are difficult questions to confront.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went onto say that, in his view, it was not worth it. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I cannot justify any one of the Australian lives lost in Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That indeed is a tragic statement but it goes to the heart of this mission creep and why we were there and the increasing view around the world that Australia was committed in Afghanistan more to its alliance with the United States than to have an outcome that was achievable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So at this point, out of respect for people who have served there, who have lost their lives or have come back injured physically and mentally, we need to now make sure that we do try to maintain the advances that have been made that were set out by the minister in his speech. This goes to the heart of Australia's deployment of aid in Afghanistan, to make sure that we continue to support the education of women and girls in particular, but it also means that we use our best efforts to make sure that the media remains interested in Afghanistan post the withdrawal of the troops so that the rest of the world comes to see what is actually going on there. There is a very real concern from NGOs in Afghanistan that they are not going to be able to continue to enable women to access medical facilities—for example, girls to access school—because, as one of their long-time activists and former parliamentarian Malalai Joya has said, history proves that these values cannot be imposed by foreign troops. She goes on to talk about the need for the countries that were engaged in the war in Afghanistan to now stand up to the administration in Afghanistan and insist that women's rights, that human rights, are upheld in Afghanistan. That is a critical issue for all of us in this parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I want to acknowledge not only our own troops who have died and been injured but also the cost to the people of Afghanistan. A large number of civilians have died in Afghanistan in that violence. This has been a human tragedy at every scale and the Australian Greens, in paying tribute to the service of our men and women, ask that the parliament thinks very carefully about changing the way we deploy our troops to war in the future. It should use a reflection on this period in Afghanistan to change the law in this country to make sure that it is parliament which actually backs deployment of troops and not just the government of the day.</span>

As you know, Mr Deputy President, I am based in Townsville, the home of Australia's largest Army base and a significant Air Force base, and many of the troops who have fought in Afghanistan left our shores from Townsville. The Townsville community is part of the military commitment wherever it is and certainly in relation to Afghanistan. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to mention in passing the Avenue of Honour which was established at Yungaburra on the banks of Lake Tinaroo, where 40 trees have been planted as a living memorial to the 40 soldiers who gave their lives in Australia's honour during the Afghanistan conflict. I want to quote from Mr Gordon Chuck, who initiated the Avenue of Honour at Yungaburra. It is a very moving area which was officially opened in June last year in the presence of the then Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, Mr Abbott and General Hurley. Mr Chuck, the father of one of those killed, Private Ben Chuck, and who initiated the memorial, said during the opening: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Although dedicated to the fallen in Afghanistan, I guess it's a representation of the commitment and courage of the Australian digger over generations. It's here to remind people that the freedoms and liberties we seem to hold so dearly, and yet often tend to take for granted, come at a terrible price—we mustn't forget that. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That memorial does, forever, commemorate the lives of soldiers who gave their lives in the defence of our country in the Afghan war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Roll of Honour at the opening ceremony was read by General Cantwell, and that in itself is a very difficult thing to do. It was a very moving ceremony and there would not have been a dry eye as General Cantwell read out the names of those who had given their lives in Afghanistan. I simply say to my colleagues that, if you ever have the chance, if you are ever in North Queensland on the Atherton Tableland behind Cairns, one of the things you must see is the Avenue of Honour. It is a magnificent living memorial to the efforts made by our soldiers in Afghanistan.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="YW4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  I was speaking to this motion when the Senate adjourned last night, and I was indicating that I will be one of the few government speakers on this debate. We are trying to get this bill to a vote. It is part of the election commitment made by the coalition. It was an election commitment which was warmly endorsed by a clear majority of all Australians. I cannot understand the Labor Party, in particular, opposing it. I can understand the Greens opposing it, because the Greens are rabid when it comes to anything to do with their favourite project of inflicting on Australia the carbon tax and all the paraphernalia around the Climate Change Authority that this bill seeks to abolish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party should understand the voice of the people. There can be no misunderstanding: as Tony Abbott said many, many a time, the last election was to be a referendum on the carbon tax. The people of Australia spoke very, very clearly on what they wanted to do with the carbon tax. They wanted it abolished. Why? Because they, like me, realised that having the world's largest carbon tax does not save the planet, it does nothing at all to reduce carbon emissions around the world. In fact I emphasised, when I spoke before, that Australia emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's emissions of carbon. If, with this carbon tax, we do reduce our emissions by five per cent, which is the goal, then five per cent of 1.4 per cent is not going to make any difference whatsoever, not one iota of difference, to the changing climate of the world if man's emission of carbon is the cause of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before my opponents malign me and keep saying that I do not believe in climate change, I repeat, for probably the 500th time in this chamber, that I do acknowledge climate change; of course the climate is changing. We were once covered with ice. Once upon a time the centre of Australia was a rainforest. Of course the climate changes. But I get sick of hearing the Greens saying that all of the floods and the cyclones we have seen in recent times are because we did not have a carbon tax early enough. Every time the Greens say, 'Look at these awful floods. They are the worst floods we've ever seen in Australia, in South-East Queensland,' I keep pointing out to them that that is only since 1974. They are not the worst. They are only worse than anything since 1974. There were bigger ones in 1974. I am sure that was climate change that caused them in 1974.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, Cyclone Yasi up my way was the worst and biggest cyclone we have ever had in Australia—since 1917, when a bigger cyclone struck the coast of North Queensland. It is all relative. The climate does move in cycles and, as someone who lives in the north, I know that cyclones are cyclic. Perhaps that is why they are called 'cyclones'. Every 10 or so years we will get a very severe cyclone. I know in my town of Ayr we had three cyclones in two years back in the late 1960s, I think it was. Fortunately, touch wood, we have not had any since then. We have seen the cyclones come and I regret for the people of Cardwell and Mission Beach that it hit there, but I have to say I was glad that it did not hit my town. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point I make is that these things happen. They have always happened. Yet if you took any notice of the Greens—which, fortunately, very few Australians do these days—you would think that all of this was because we did not have a carbon tax early enough. They say, 'We're going to stop Australia's emissions by five per cent'—that is five per cent of the 1.4 per cent—and suddenly that is going to cure every cyclone and every flood in the world. I heard Senator Waters on the radio this morning and learned there is a new reason for climate change, and that is the fact that Mr Hunt has today, fortuitously, given approval for the Abbot Point coal terminal expansion. It is news that I was delighted to hear. At last common-sense has prevailed. Senator Waters even claimed that this decision is going to ruin the Barrier Reef—mind you, if Senator Waters had a look at a map she would see that Abbot Point is a long, long way from the Barrier Reef. According to her, it is going to destroy not only the Barrier Reef and the tourist industry but, from the way Senator Waters was going on, you would think it is going to destroy mankind. But it is also going to cause climate change, according to Senator Waters. These are the sorts of wild accusations you get from the radical environment movement. They have no interest in science and proper process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of Abbot Point, the approval is given subject to the most stringent conditions—conditions that have been imposed by scientists and people who understand these issues. You will have the Greens and Greenpeace and everyone protesting. The Greens always love the standard of living that Australia's wealth brings, but they want to stop the process that brings the wealth to Australia. It brings wealth to Australia in a sustainable way that is environmentally conscious. The conditions that Mr Hunt has imposed are pretty stringent. I just hope they do not frighten away the proponents. I am hopeful that those developments will go ahead, because it will mean so much to the people in the small township of Bowen, just south of where I live. I recently attended a seminar in Bowen when the whole town was anxiously awaiting approval for this expansion. There were small business people and people wanting jobs in that area who were desperately keen for a decision to be made. I congratulate Mr Hunt on his decision to proceed with that, and with the Gladstone and Mackay proposals as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You will hear a lot from the Greens and the ABC over the next week or so on how this is really going to destroy mankind, but I ask those who might be interested to have a look at the conditions, to understand that these approvals are set with the interests of Australia and Australians in mind. You will hear the Greens saying, 'This will bring so many more ships through the Barrier Reef and that will destroy the Barrier Reef.' I am sorry, but ships have been coming through the Barrier Reef for over a hundred years and any problems that the Barrier Reef has have not been caused by ships sailing between the reef and the mainland or through one of the channels there. I am delighted that Mr Hunt has made that decision, and I will do everything in my power to support that decision and support the people of Bowen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The workers and the miners who have been losing their jobs in the Queensland coalfields do not know where the Labor Party are when it comes to the loss of workers' jobs because of carbon taxes and mining taxes. You never seem to see them. They are only interested in the miners and the workers when they pay their union fees and can allow the union bosses to do whatever they do do these days with union fees. We only have to look at Mr Thomson to understand some of the things that are being done with union fees. But that seems to be the only time the Labor Party are interested in the jobs of workers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am interested in the jobs of miners in Central Queensland. I am interested in small businesses in Bowen and Mackay. I am interested in those wanting work there. I am interested, more than any, I might say, in our tourist industry and our fishing industry and in making sure that our greatest national asset, the Great Barrier Reef, is protected. I am confident that the decision made today, with all its conditions, will continue to protect the Great Barrier Reef. I remind the Greens and the Labor Party that, if they look back through history, it has been the Liberal Party in government that have taken all the significant measures to protect the Great Barrier Reef, because we have always understood how significant it is. It is a win-win situation on Abbot Point. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have digressed, I have to say, a little bit from the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill, but it was important to bring things into perspective and to reject Senator Waters' claim, which I heard her make on radio, that the approval for Abbot Point will hasten climate change around the world. This just shows the stupidity of the comments. </span>

                    </a>  I appreciate your protection, Mr Acting Deputy President. I would rather have the debate with Senator Whish-Wilson, because, as with so many things that the Greens say, it is all based on scaremongering and certainly not on science. You just have them saying anything on the basis that the end justifies the means. I know the Greenpeace attitude: tell any lie you like, as long as you get the result you want. Isn't it the Greenpeace motto: tell any lie you like, misrepresent any fact, as long as you get the end result you want? All lies and misrepresentations are in order. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting back to the bill before us, it is essential that we are allowed to honour the commitment we made to the Australian people, and that the Australian Labor Party made to the Australian people as well. I re-emphasise to the Australian Labor Party and to people who might be listening to this debate: it was the Australian Labor Party, the ALP, the Gillard government, that solemnly promised before the 2010 election that they would not introduce a carbon tax. Yet, today we hear from Labor speakers that it is so good. If it is so good, can you tell me why your leader prior to the 2010 election promised not to bring it in? Because of that promise, she got herself elected. Before the 2013 election, the Senate spokesman for the Labor Party was handing round pamphlets in her campaign saying, 'We've already got rid of the carbon tax.' How is that? This is a pamphlet from the opposition spokesman in this chamber on the environment before the election saying, 'We've got rid of the carbon tax.' Well, they hadn't. But here is her chance now. She can retrospectively honour the promise that she was making then that they had gotten rid of it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will be well advised in relation to climate matters by the CSIRO, whose science and understanding we greatly respect. We will be advised by the Bureau of Meteorology—Australia<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s weather experts, who are world-renowned. We do not need a Climate Change Authority made up of Labor Party friends, with hundreds of public servants and huge costs, giving the previous government the sort of advice they wanted to hear. I have to say it was more political advice than it was climate change advice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not need that, and the Australian people do not need to have to pay for that. We have some of the pre-eminent scientific organisations in the world—the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO—there to advise us. We also have very expert people in the Department of the Environment to advise the minister. We have a minister who understands these things, unlike previous ministers, and who appreciates what is what and, more importantly, a minister who is determined to ensure that the promises we made to the Australian people before the last election are honoured.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:20</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. We are here today to discuss the Abbott government's continued attack on science and on the Public Service. We are here today to witness the continuation of the Abbott government's tactic of destroying agencies whose expertise does not match with the ideology of the new government. We are here today, yet again, to be dismayed by the Abbott government's continued attack on openness and transparency. And we are here today because those on the government benches do not wish for frank and fearless advice from the Public Service, just hollow echoes of their own thought bubbles. This is a disappointing development in Australian politics, and it is not in the interests of the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This attempt to destroy the Climate Change Authority comes on top of the government's closure of the Climate Commission and AusAID, the abolition of the science portfolio, the loss of hundreds of jobs from CSIRO and the earlier attempt to destroy the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. While in this place we often disagree on policy, never have we disagreed upon the need for public debate to be informed by expert advice—that is, never before the election of this current Liberal-Nationals government. We may disagree on whose expert advice is best, but never before has a government in this country sought to destroy agencies simply because their expert advice is not to the liking of the government's blinkered, narrow-minded belief system. That is what we are witnessing today. The Liberal-Nationals government is seeking to destroy the Climate Change Authority because it does not like the advice it provides and it does not want any government authority at all to be able to measure how well or—more likely—how poorly its Direct Action policy is or is not working.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Climate Change Authority, in a measured and sensible manner, provides expert knowledge about action to counter climate change both in Australia and internationally, the efficacy of those actions and the adequacy of those actions. The Climate Change Authority completed its first review of the Renewable Energy Target in December 2012, recommending keeping the renewable energy target at 41,000 gigawatt hours. The Climate Change Authority has commenced work on the first review of Australia's emissions reduction goals. The targets and progress review will recommend short-, medium- and long-term emission reduction goals and assess Australia's progress towards its medium- and long-term emissions reduction targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its targets and progress review report to the government, due to be released in February 2014, the authority will review Australia's progress towards its medium- and long-term emissions reduction targets; recommend a 2020 emissions reduction target; recommend a national carbon budget and indicative national emissions trajectory; discuss how Australia might meet its trajectory, budget and target, including how different sectors of the economy could contribute and the role of international emissions reductions; and, as required by legislation, recommend caps on emissions under the carbon-pricing mechanism. In framing its recommendations, the authority draws upon existing and new analysis of a wide range of issues, including the accumulating body of science and underpinning concerns about climate change; the extent and nature of ongoing international arrangements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; how any global efforts to reduce emissions might be shared among nations; and the economic and social implications for Australia of different targets for reducing emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal-Nationals government do not want to hear the outcome of this report because they know it will say things that their members in the 'climate change is crap' brigade do not want to hear. They do not want to discuss how Australia might meet its trajectory, budget and target because they have no intention to meet any of these.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even in the draft report, which is publicly available on the climate change agency's website—and I am sure the Liberal-National government will try to hide or expunge it as they tried to expunge the Gonski report—there are a number of points they do not like because these points expose how dishonest they have been when debating climate change science and climate change economics. The draft report highlights that significant action is being taken on climate change by the international community. China has pilot emissions trading schemes planned for seven provinces and cities. The first began in 2013 and there are plans to design a national emissions trading scheme—that is right: China, the world's most populous nation, a Communist nation, is adopting a market based emissions trading scheme while the Australian Liberal-National government, the Abbott-Truss government, is introducing Marxist-style direct government intervention into the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this issue the Chinese Communist government are acting more liberal than the Australian Liberal Party itself. To put it another way: on this issue the action by the Australian Liberal Party is more Marxist than the actions of the Chinese Communist government are. I am surprised that Minister Abetz can keep from choking when trying to explain this direct action policy. China has renewable energy targets, feed-in tariff support for solar, wind and biomass power, a policy of closure of inefficient small- and medium-sized coal plants and industrial facilities, appliance and building standards, an energy efficiency target, industrial energy efficiency retrofits and vehicle fuel efficiency standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The United States of America has subnational emissions trading schemes in California and nine north-eastern states, subnational renewable energy targets, financial incentives supporting renewable energy, proposed national regulations limiting emissions from fossil fuel power plants, appliance and building standards, industrial energy efficiency assessments, vehicle fuel efficiency standards and vehicle emissions standards. The European Union has an emissions trading scheme amongst its 28 member states and Norway, a renewable energy target and support for cogeneration, feed-in tariffs for renewable energy, appliance and building standards, an energy efficiency target, vehicle emissions standards and renewable fuel production incentives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">India has a coal tax, an energy efficiency trading scheme for the power sector, renewable energy targets, vehicle fuel efficiency standards and vehicle emissions standards pending. Japan, Canada, South Korea, South Africa and New Zealand have taken substantive action to tackle climate change. There ends the furphy that no other nations are doing anything about climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you combine all those countries you can see that substantive action is being taken by countries representing an overwhelming majority of the world's population and carbon dioxide output. You can see why the government do not want an agency that explicitly collates and releases that data, because it is not in the Liberal-National government's interest for that information to be widely distributed amongst the Australian population. Mr Abbott and his friends are happy for there to be a widespread belief that there has been no international action on climate change. Indeed, they have dishonestly pushed that view strongly over the last six years. The Abbott-Truss government is not going to like the Climate Change Authority's targets and progress review report because it will recommend a higher target than five per cent on 2000 levels. That can be clearly seen in the draft report which is already released. The draft report says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Authority presents two options:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">a 2020 emissions reduction target of 15 per cent below 2000 levels, with a 2030 trajectory range of 35-50 per cent; or</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">a 2020 target of 25 per cent with a 2030 trajectory range of 40-50 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Authority will recommend a single 2020 target and a single 2030 trajectory range in its Final Report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Either of these recommendations the Abbott-Truss government will find extremely embarrassing. That is because Tony Abbott has recently confirmed that his government has abandoned its longstanding policy to reduce Australia's emissions by between five and 25 per cent of 2000 levels by 2020, a crucial and internationally scrutinised goal that had retained bipartisan support since 2009, despite significant international action, as I outlined. It is no real surprise to see Tony Abbott walking away from his early support for Australia's commitment—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am surprised—and pretty disappointed, quite frankly—that the Nationals are agreeing to the abolition of a board that is providing tens of millions of dollars of funding to projects in rural communities around the country. I am disappointed that the Nationals are agreeing to the abolition of a board that is making farming more sustainable and more environmentally friendly into the future. They really need to have a good hard look at themselves and have a think about what they really believe and who they really represent.</span>

Can Senators Fiona Nash and John Williams explain to the farmers of New South Wales why the Nationals are agreeing to abolish the organisation that, through the Action on the Ground grant program, provided funding of up to $394,000 to trial minimum tillage practices, including controlled traffic and use of mulches, to reduce nitrous oxide emissions and increase sequestration of soil carbon during the production of vegetable crops in New South Wales? Can Senator McKenzie explain to the farmers of Victoria and to my home state of Tasmania as well why the Nationals are agreeing to abolish the organisation that, through the Action on the Ground grant program, provided funding of up to $540,909 for increased nitrogen use efficiency by cropping farmers in the high-rainfall zones of Victoria and Tasmania?

I am surprised that the Liberal-National government want to destroy an organisation that now has significant expertise in overseeing carbon sequestering, enhancing sustainable agricultural practices and planting trees when these are all parts of their own Direct Action policy. You are abolishing the board that has the expertise to push your own policy agenda. That is crazy. It is just remarkable.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have come into this place with this bill and the previous bill on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation without presenting a clear case for the abolition of either of these bodies. They have made no argument other than a hollow ideological fig leaf of reducing bureaucracy, while at the same time advocating for direct government action on climate change. How much bureaucracy will it take to administer their Direct Action policy? They have stated that they have a policy to 'cut bureaucracy' in the Climate Change Authority, the Land Sector Carbon and Biodiversity Board and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, yet will create a massive bureaucracy to administer their Direct Action policy. It is utterly ridiculous, honestly. Ironically, the expertise they will need to administer their Direct Action plan is already possessed by people in the Climate Change Authority, the Land Sector Carbon and Biodiversity Board and—you guessed it—the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. This Liberal-National government will make them redundant and pay their redundancies, only to find that they will need to rehire them through the Department of the Environment when they realise their Marxist Direct Action policy will need considerably more bureaucracy than those that they have sought to destroy over the last few weeks.</span>

Proper debate in this place should be based on fact, not on ideology. The Australian people should be greatly concerned about the Liberal-National habit of destroying agencies and boards whose advice they are opposed to merely for ideological reasons. As I said, this attempt to destroy the Climate Change Authority comes on top of the government's closure of the Climate Commission and AusAID, the abolition of the science portfolio, the loss of hundreds of jobs from CSIRO and previous attempts to destroy the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.</span>

I just find it a bit of a joke. It is a joke, unfortunately, at the expense of the Australian people. I would urge all senators, but particularly those National Party senators who are voting to destroy a board that has granted tens of millions of dollars to Australian farmers, the people they claim to represent, to think again and to vote against this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:40</span>):  I rise also to speak against the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. One of the things I want to take up from Senator Bilyk is trying to encourage the National Party to have a separate view from the Liberal Party. That is a long bow, quite frankly. They are truly the doormats to the Liberal Party. We have not seen them spectacularly stand up for anything much at all, quite frankly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting back to the point, though, not only is this bill, along with the proposed repeal of other clean energy acts, environmental vandalism at its very heart, but at best these bills will if passed ensure that Australia's reputation as a progressive economy will fail. The rest of the world will view us in a negative way if we remove not only the Climate Change Authority but also the other work that has been progressed for a very long time. Moreover, our ability to effect real change in the economy to deal with the negative effects of climate change will be lost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Abolishing the Climate Change Authority shows the contempt that the Abbott government has for independent advice on climate science and how it views our society and the economy. If you look at the latest series of attacks by the Abbott government on the scientific community in Australia—the cuts to the CSIRO and the abolition of the Climate Commission—what really underpins that is this base view of a complete rejection of grounded scientific research—so much so that what they are going to do will take the work that is being done by an independent umpire and stick it in the department. Incorporating the functions of the CCA into the Department of the Environment will mean ultimately that the minister will control the message and will be able to influence the content. It will mean, given the current history of this Abbott government, less transparency. We will not be privy to the work that they do, which is the hallmark of this government to date. It has not been able to move away from a negative agenda masked in secrecy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The course of action by the Liberals will mean that the work done so far to lower emissions and have a cleaner energy future and a stronger economy will not happen. The Liberals and the Nats—I much prefer just to use the word 'Liberals', because I think the Nats are as one with them—will argue that this action they are taking is designed to address the perception that electricity prices have risen as a direct result of the clean energy legislation of the Rudd-Gillard government. But nothing could be further from the truth. The Climate Institute correctly identifies that, one year on from the introduction of the legislation, the electricity sector emissions have fallen, the economy is growing and the cost of living has not ballooned as the Liberals argued it would. We can all remember what Mr Abbott said would happen: the sky would fall in. He then went to a python squeeze and ultimately bellyflopped with the rhetoric that he used to describe how the economy would be destroyed as a consequence of believing in climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news is that the annual carbon emissions have fallen. The regulated carbon limits have fallen by at least 12 million tonnes. It is rubbish for the Liberals to continue to spread the lie that electricity prices have risen as a consequence of this legislation. But they will continue, I suspect, even in this debate to argue that electricity prices have risen. Consumers know it, households know it: they have risen as a consequence of network upgrades, replacing ageing infrastructure. Around 40 per cent of the contribution of the carbon price has accounted for only nine per cent of power bills in 2012-13 according to the Climate Change Institute. No wonder the Liberals want to get rid of an independent umpire that provides facts and figures about the economy and how we are addressing climate change. They do not want the consumer or households to be aware of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The economy has continued to remain relatively strong, unlike the doom and gloom the Liberals in opposition argued would happen. The impact of the carbon price has been barely discernible according to the ABS, again, an independent body. When you move the climate authority into the department, can you have the same confidence that it will be an independent voice of reason? I doubt it. The great majority of Australian consumers have not been impacted by the carbon price. For those households that have been impacted, it has been a very small effect and there has been an assistance package there to assist. Of course it has not stopped the extreme language of the Liberals in talking down the economy, exaggerating the effects of putting a price on carbon and ignoring the reasons for the need to address climate change using the best market based mechanisms available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals demonstrated in the last 100 days or so that they have forgotten how the market works. It can be the only explanation for the Liberals to justify why they are moving from market based mechanisms to regulatory planned models that really hark back to the 1960s, which was the last time we saw them in this country. One wonders what did happen to the Liberals and free market? You only have to go back to the 2007 federal election under Mr John Howard, who effectively was supporting an emissions trading scheme as part of their platform. There has been an enormous transformation, it appears. Instead of progressing forward with market based economic solutions, we have gone back 20 years to the 1960s under the Liberals who support a planned economy. I guess next we will be hearing them champion Stalin.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did the Liberal Party of Australia become? Now it looks like champions of a centrally planned economic policy. To give you some feel for that, the so-called Direct Action policy is widely discredited. Let me go to some of the black holes that it is. The government, I suspect, will be required to put significant funding into the Direct Action policy if it is ever to work. We will move from that question as to whether they want it to work or whether it is just a face saver for true climate deniers. It is, quite frankly, an odd policy when you look at the content of it—if we could. Of course they have not put that on the table.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can assume what direct action means. They have made some statements about it. It does look to date, though, to be politically convenient but ideologically incongruous, financially expensive and probably irrelevant to the future. It certainly will not fit into the global action on climate change. But none of this has stopped the Liberals on their relentless march towards political expediency by effectively, I think, being captured by the climate change deniers within their own party, who are now seeking to tear down a market based solution and replace it with the regulatory model which effectively consists of a two-word slogan of 'direct action' with no details behind it, a call to arms perhaps by the Liberals to try and find a bit more meat on the bone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be honest: the real reason they want to repeal the clean energy bill including the Climate Change Authority and replace it with a policy with no details is, ultimately, the climate change deniers captured the Liberal Party. They do not believe in climate change. They do not want to effect change and they will continue to use Direct Action. Without a model to look at to see how it will work, it seems to be a system that will use taxpayers' money to fund big business in an attempt to reduce emissions—a very poor way to try to reduce emissions. Maybe those on the other side will be able to enlighten me in this debate how that Direct Action policy will work, how it will achieve the most efficient reduction of emissions through the use of taxpayers' money in the first place and why they would replace it with a market based mechanism. But we have not heard from them about that. There will be plenty of excuses later as to why Direct Action fails but let us not get ahead of the debate here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition have promised that their flawed clean energy policy rests on two things: the repeal of the carbon legislation and the implementation of Direct Action. What we have before parliament is only half the policy. It is true that they are attempting to do the repeal today, but I think that they, even in government and true to the Liberal's DNA, can only say no to sensible policy which will achieve a clean energy future and, through a market based operation, the reduction of carbon emissions while maintaining a strong economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While they say that they accept climate change, that it is real and that humans are contributing to it, I am not convinced that they are truly saying it with conviction. The Liberals have not told us how the other half of their Direct Action policy will achieve real and meaningful change. They promised to be a consultative government, a stable adult government and a government that would work with others, and I think this is where the public have been misled by the coalition while in opposition and when they came to government. The government's first actions have been to abolish what they can see, to abolish what they do not understand, to say no to things that they are unsure of and to continue to cut harshly into the Public Service and the economy. They explained none of that in the lead-up to the last election, and I think the public have a right to ask whether this is the government that they elected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any responsible government would have put their credentials on the table and indicated how they were going to achieve their reductions through direct action. The coalition said that the action plan would coincide with the introduction of their Direct Action Plan to tackle climate change. That is what they have said. Where is it? It is not on the table. Let us be clear about the coalition's position. They are now asking us to abolish the Climate Change Authority, an independent umpire that provides an independent voice. They want to remove the market mechanism to reduce emissions. They want to do all of the above, without putting their bona fides on the table and without indicating what will replace it, while continuing to be a negative and carping government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic impact of this has not been modelled. One of the things that Senator Cormann became famous for, without verballing him too much, is asking for modelling. Where is the modelling to show that Direct Action will achieve the outcomes? Have they done the modelling? Have they provided the certainty that removing a market based mechanism such as the ETS will be less efficient than their Direct Action program? I am not going to embarrass Senator Cormann by asking for the modelling. Quite frankly, I think we all know that it does not exist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is more likely that a Direct Action program will simply be a transfer for dud harebrained schemes that big business dream up to suck money out of the Australian taxpayer to support their attempts of reducing emissions. I think any and all of that will be on the table for the Liberals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The unstated problem with this Direct Action Plan is: where is the money going to come from? How are they going to fund it? Some of the critical elements of their Direct Action Plan are simply not there. More importantly, where is the modelling to show that they will be able to purchase sufficient domestic abatement to meet Australia's bipartisan 2020 emissions reduction target of five per cent compared with the 2000 levels, based on the work done by the Department of Climate Change? Will we achieve the targets or will we simply be provided with an excuse as to why there will be a shortfall? That is the crucial bit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at the evidence to date, the size of the suggested shortfall—that is, the difference between what the emissions trading scheme under Labor would achieve and what Direct Action could possibly achieve—will be the difference between the target of 159 million tonnes of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> abatement and about 40 million tonnes, which is the amount Direct Action will achieve on average by 2020 according to some of the best estimates. So there will be about 119 million tonnes missing. Where are they going to find it? One of their Direct Action proposals is to plant trees. They are going to be busy painting trees to achieve that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals will say that greenhouse gas emissions trading schemes are not world's best practice. But, if you look at the evidence to date, there are schemes operational in several countries around the world. Schemes are operational in Switzerland, New Zealand and South Korea, and subnational schemes are legislated in the US, Canada and Japan. The Kyoto protocol also provides for emissions trading across nations. China has also moved with a network of seven pilot schemes planned to begin in 2013. You get the sense that the world is moving one way and Australia, under Tony Abbott, is moving the other way. It seems impossible to consider Direct Action as being a viable, workable and effective scheme in an international setting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most telling criticisms of Direct Action comes from someone who would have direct knowledge of the matter. Mr Turnbull offered this advice in February 2010 when he spoke of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Until 1 December last year, there was a bipartisan commitment in Australia that this carbon price, this exercise in reducing emissions, should be imposed by means of a market based mechanism—this emissions trading scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As we have seen in recent days, alternatives such as direct regulation or subsidies will be far more costly to the economy, no matter how hard their designers seek to argue the contrary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will leave it that I agree with his words.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Turnbull went on to bell the cat. He recognised that the subsidy schemes, like the Direct Action proposal, will encourage government to pick projects for subsidies, which will be a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale. This will result in more costly and less effective abatement of emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion in this debate, and coming back to the main scope of this bill: again, it is simply a negative, retrograde step by a government that has no clear policy and that can only see its way to say 'no', to abolish things and to cut things. It has no positive plan for Australia's future, and this is but one example of where removing the independent umpire also gives it the ability to hide the truth and not allow it to be put into the public domain—to control the message.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  I rise to oppose the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. We have said it, they have heard it and former Prime Minister Rudd announced that we would abolish the carbon tax. Done and dusted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this government is playing political games with the carbon tax. The carbon tax is all it talks about. You would think that what is before the Australian parliament is one bill to abolish the carbon tax. But what this government is trying to do is much more than abolish the carbon tax, and they are trying to hide that fact from Australian voters. In fact, the only time we hear the coalition government talk about all of the other parts of its abolition bills is in response to Labor putting the success of our climate change policy on the public record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government wants Labor to support much, much more than the abolition of the carbon tax. The coalition government would have us believe that it has a mandate, that the federal election was all about the carbon tax, when the facts are that the carbon tax did not rate as a top five issue. The coalition government thinks Labor should just fall into line with its wishes and its wants. Well, what the Labor opposition is doing is acting responsibly. We are siding with the Australian public, with Australian voters, because they want action on climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, the PM, Mr Abbott, invited Australians to let their elected representatives know loud and clear about their views on the carbon tax. And I thank Mr Abbott, because Australian voters are letting us know what they want—letting us know loud and clear that they do not support the abolition of the carbon tax without replacing it with an emissions trading scheme. This is exactly Labor's position, and despite Mr Abbott taking a gamble and inviting voters to email politicians with their views I have not had one—not one—email supporting the coalition government's position. Not one email supporting its Direct Action plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to the coalition government: keep your heads buried in the sand, ignoring the views of Australian voters, ignoring the views of experts and abolishing authorities such as the Climate Change Authority because they produce reports based on science and rigorous analysis which lead to outcomes that do not support the government's rhetoric and do not support the government's instincts on climate change. And they do not support the views of the climate change deniers who now make up this coalition government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government does not want independent expert advice. It treats advice based on science or facts with hostility. It has nailed its colours to the mast of the rotten ship SS <span style="font-style:italic;">Direct Action</span> and is not letting go, no matter what the science says and no matter what Australian voters think. This move by the coalition government to abolish the Climate Change Authority demonstrates this government's complete hostility—complete hostility—to independent expert advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no reason to abolish the Climate Change Authority. In fact, there is every reason to keep it. And again, Senator Abetz and the government showed their complete lack of understanding of the Climate Change Authority when Senator Abetz said in the Senate on 2 December in relation to the Climate Change Authority:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… in relation to the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill—why are we putting that forward? Because if you remove the carbon tax there is no real need for this authority, …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the government demonstrates that it has not done its homework. It does not know what it is talking about when it comes to climate change, because the Climate Change Authority undertakes reviews and makes recommendations on a range of matters, including emissions reduction targets and carbon budgets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The renewable energy target—how will we measure that without an independent authority? And there is the Carbon Farming Initiative—something that I would have thought the National Party would want to know about and receive advice on—and the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting System.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Climate Change Authority board—I do not know if the coalition has had a look at who is on this board—are leading experts in industry, in economics and in science. They are an extremely well-qualified board that all Australians should be proud of and they are an experienced board. Why would any competent government ignore their advice and shut them down so their voice can no longer be heard? The Climate Change Authority has nothing to do with the carbon tax. The reason the government does not want to keep it and wants to abolish it is quite simple: it does not want to be held accountable on its Direct Action Plan. It does not have a single supporter for this policy, which has been around for three years—not a single supporter in the scientific or economic fields. When direct action does not work, the government will not be held accountable for its actions because it is stripping away any authority which might hold it to account. This government, despite its rhetoric, does not want to be held accountable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government just wants to lick its finger, stick it in the air and see which way the wind is blowing. That is the extent of its interest in science—relying on its instincts rather than on the overwhelming evidence from 97 per cent of the world's climate scientists. Dr Dennis Jensen, the federal member for Tangney, told interviewer Jonathan Swan that just because 97 per cent of research papers published in scientific journals agree that humans are causing climate change this does not necessarily mean they are right, because, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the argument of consensus … is a flawed argument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So Dr Jensen does not accept the position of the world's science academies and Australia's CSIRO that climate change is caused mainly by humans burning fossil fuels and chopping down trees. Instincts are an absolute trait of the coalition government. Former Prime Minister Howard told a London audience that those of us who accept that climate change is real are a bunch of 'religious zealots' and that he will trust his instincts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a while since Mr Howard was the Prime Minister of this country so one would have hoped that the coalition might have updated its knowledge and might have looked at some science—but, no, that trust in instincts and gut feelings continues in the current coalition. Prime Minister Abbott, the person who wants us to scrap any policies which put a price on carbon and to scrap the job of experts such as those who work in and manage the Climate Change Authority, told us two years ago:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… whether carbon dioxide is quite the environmental villain that some people make it out to be is not yet proven.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Abbott obviously has not availed himself of the work of 97 per cent of the world's climate scientists. The Australian public know it, Labor know it, the Greens know it, but it seems the coalition is living in some kind of climate sceptics vacuum. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently and, quite frankly, more embarrassingly, Prime Minister Tony Abbott accused the United Nations climate chief of 'talking through her hat'. That quote has been repeated quite a lot in this house and elsewhere. It is embarrassing than our Prime Minister, the supposed leader of our country, accuses the United Nations climate chief of talking through her hat. It just shows that ignorance about climate science is alive and well within the coalition. The classic, of course, was a comment by Minister Greg Hunt, the Minister for the Environment, someone who is expected to know everything about his portfolio. I accept that as a minister there are some views you take and some views you do not. But when you are so in the public eye, when you have such an important portfolio as the Environment portfolio, you should be able to quote the science or the economics. Whether you agree with it or not, you should know what is out there. Yet what did Minister Hunt confess to using? Wikipedia. With all of the resources the minister has in his office, in the department, in the Climate Change Authority, he turns to Wikipedia to contradict the United Nations climate chief. And he contradicted her opinion in a BBC interview. Again, oh dear me, how embarrassing. First the Prime Minister of our country and then our environment minister—how embarrassing for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a message for Mr Abbott and Mr Hunt: it is proven. I have another message: there exists an authority, the Climate Change Authority, which is a group of independent, and ethical, experts in their fields. These people know that the science is proven. Why do they know it? Not because of their instincts, not because they stick their finger in the air to find out which way the wind is blowing, not because somebody told them; they know it through rigorous research , rigorous analysis, checking their facts, conferring with other scientists—that is how they know it. They provided the former ALP government, the 43th Parliament, with recommendations and guidance—and with evidence, Mr Abbott and the coalition government, not instincts, but real evidence—and provided expert advice to allow the Australian government to set up effective climate change mitigation initiatives, and not an unsupported direct action policy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government is attempting to hoodwink the Australian public and shut down credible authorities, such as the Climate Change Authority. This government is more and more lining up with the climate change deniers, ignoring transparent and independent information that goes against their political wants and against the political outcomes that they want. Australia was such a leader of positive reforms in the past, and it was a leader with our current climate change legislation. But now under the Abbott government we are embarrassing ourselves internationally. Do we really want to line up with the likes of Monckton, who says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sorts of instincts that the coalition government are lining up behind are the views of the likes of Monckton. This government must separate this bill from the wider carbon tax debate, just as Labor has done—and we got a lot of criticism from Senator Abetz as to why we would want to separate these bills. We want to separate them out because we want Australian voters to know that this government wants to shut down a credible organisation, a credible, factual, well-resourced organisation with an expert management board, the Climate Change Authority. Why? Because it might not always agree with what the government is saying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we want to assess the Climate Change Authority on its merits and we want to assess the merits of the abolition bill that is before us. Leave aside differences on the views of carbon pricing, forget about the 'carbon tax', as nobody campaigned to keep it, and tell us and the Australian people why you want to ignore the Climate Change Authority, an authority which provides bipartisan and transparent information to government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The campaign by this coalition government of shutting down credible scientists and climate change organisations started with the firing of the former Secretary of the Department of Climate Change, Blair Comley, who dared to be more honest about the state of climate change than the coalition was willing to accept. They do not want frank advice; they tell us that they can get the advice elsewhere. But departments are not best placed to give free and fearless advice; independent bodies are best placed to do that. But this government does not want any expert to advise on Australia's international targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Climate Change Authority said in their October draft report that Australia should aim for a 15 per cent cut in emissions by 2020. The CCA believe that leaving our emissions target at its current level will prove to be inadequate into the future. This is an example of the Climate Change Authority's frank and fearless advice. Repealing the legislation and abolishing the Climate Change Authority is a demonstration of the government completely disregarding this information. The establishment of an independent Climate Change Authority to advise on the operation of a carbon pricing scheme or a direct action scheme is critical but, again, this government wants to go backwards and turn back the clock with no assessment of whether the authority is good, bad or indifferent, and with no transparency. It is a case of: let us just get on and continue to try to hoodwink people, as this government continues to rely on instincts and not facts and not scientific evidence. I do not support the abolition of the Climate Change Authority. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  It is a great shame that we have to speak to this matter today in the chamber, but there are many issues that seem to be confronting us with this new government that seek to undo the visionary work and to pull apart things that were established during the 43rd Parliament for the greater good of this community and, certainly in the long term, with a vision for all Australians, not just an expeditious view of the moment but a proper, mature and adult view of our responsibility to the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1990, an aspiring environmental lawyer by the name of Greg Hunt put the finishing touches to his honours thesis. It was titled <span style="font-style:italic;">A carb</span><span style="font-style:italic;">on tax to make the polluter pay </span>and its conclusion was to propose the wide use of pollution taxes as a means of both raising revenue for environmental agencies and compelling polluters to decrease their emissions. Oh how the mighty ideals have fallen. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the coalition pretend their farce of a policy that is Direct Action is a 'no regrets' solution, we all know that they are kidding themselves. Deep down there is at least one of them who must regret it—the minister for Wikipedia himself. It is rumoured that on the particularly quiet nights in Canberra you can hear him crying, overcome by the shame of his complete about-face. Day in, day out he tries to sell a policy designed by a Prime Minister who is on the record as describing climate change as 'absolute crap'. It is enough to drive one to tears. The very fact that the minister put in charge of dismantling Labor's market-based solution wrote an honours thesis advocating for one exposes this government's climate change policy as a sham.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is deceiving the Australian people on climate change. It is deceiving this parliament and it is also clearly deceiving itself. Action on climate change requires a market-based solution, and Labor's emissions trading scheme is certainly the most effective means of delivering it. Business knows it, the public knows it and—though he is loath to admit it—the environment minister himself knows it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I call on the coalition: if you really want to stop the waste, stop wasting this parliament's time by moving to repeal the most effective means of reducing carbon emissions. The coalition would do well to work with Labor—the real adults in the room—to move from a fixed price to an ETS by 1 July 2014. Future generations will not look kindly on this coalition government for dismantling our nation's commitment to develop a sustainable economy through market-based solutions, especially when its alleged policy alternative is nothing more than a glint in the environment minister's eye. It is a 'trust me' stance from someone who cannot even be trusted to stand by his very own words.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have already seen on display in this parliament the fact that the government does have a trust deficit. They promised to stop the boats and buy the boats, but all they have done is hide the boats. They promised to end the waste, but instead they have spent close to $1 billion extra each week since coming to office and have removed all parliamentary oversight of how much more they can spend. There is no limit on their credit card now—so much for a budget emergency. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They promised that Australia was open for business, but instead they have blocked investment into the struggling GrainCorp and left Qantas and Holden flapping in the breeze. While I am sure that Qantas appreciates the airfares for Mr Abbott's flight to Johannesburg, it is not exactly going to cover the hundreds of millions of dollars shortfall in revenue or make up for the coalition's inaction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a government that promised to be the adults in the room, they are certainly acting like toddlers in the midst of a tantrum. The coalition's economic impotence has been on prominent display during its short time in office, and it is on display again here today in their efforts to replace Labor's comprehensive market-based solution with their own 'watch this space' command and control, white elephant Direct Action policy. It is laughable to think the coalition is demanding the repeal of Labor's solution to climate change with nothing more than a thought bubble as an alternative. No green paper, no white paper—nothing. Just, 'Trust us. We know what we're doing.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But here we are, nonetheless, at this point. Labor has separated the government's legislation to give the coalition a chance to recover at least a shred of credibility on climate change by retaining the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Climate Change Authority. We do so because the nation demands action on climate change, and the initiatives of the CEFC and the CCA, though complementary to it, are not bound by the retention of a price on carbon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to put on the record some of the commentary that came out of the very short Senate hearing into the CEFC to make this point even more clearly. 'Rather than ''crowding out'' the private sector, the CEFC was ''crowding in'' banks that would not otherwise lend'. These were the words reported by Peter Hannam in his article 'Victim of a changed climate' in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>on 30 November. Jillian Broadbent, who is the chair of the CEFC, said to the committee, 'When you have a $10 billion fund, you can … have a discussion with the CEO of the Commonwealth Bank. If you did not have a $10 billion fund … you were just there to have a powwow.' That is the impact of having the CEFC. Similarly, to show how short-sighted this current Liberal government is, I want to put on the record John Hewson's view that the scrapping of the CEFC, along with the carbon price, was merely short-term politics. He says, 'It's not necessarily an economic or business position. It's a political position.' And it is a very bad political position. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not think that Jillian Broadbent could be declared as a great friend of Labor. Her role is as a specialist consultant for the Anglo-South African investment bank, Investec, and she actually said, 'I think we probably all know more Liberal Party people than we do Labor people,' when she was speaking to the Senate inquiry. She also made this statement, which I think is absolutely telling: 'If the bipartisan mood existed, everyone would be very excited about what the CEFC was doing.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is not with the CEFC or with the CCA. The problem is with the bloody-mindedness, the ideological bent, the denial of fact and the absence of a care for the future that is on show, with shame, for all to see in the legislation that is being pushed through this parliament by this shameful government that we are having to call to account today. The CEFC was doing its job of providing low-cost capital to stimulate investment in emission reduction, and the CCA needs to continue to do its job of providing independent advice to the government on the best climate change mitigation initiatives. You would think these two issues alone would easily garner bipartisan support but, as is too often the case with the Abbott coalition, you would  be wrong. Put simply, this is not a government that sees climate change as a threat. It is not even a government that accepts the science of climate change, as my colleague in the Senate, Senator Lines, has just made so clearly evident in her speech. This government appears wilfully oblivious to the fact that consensus among climate scientists now is at 97 per cent. I do not know about you, Madam Acting Deputy President, but when I took home a test, having got 97 per cent on it, I used to be reasonably happy. I did get upset occasionally when I would get the reply, 'But what happened to the other three per cent?' There is a difference being on the 97 per cent side of the equation and deciding, as a government of a sovereign nation, to line up with the three per centers. There is something terribly wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2009, the coalition walked away from climate change by electing a climate change sceptic leader, who is on the record saying he is 'hugely unconvinced by the so-called settled science on climate change'. That was on the <span style="font-style:italic;">7:30 Report</span> on the ABC. Needless to say, it leaves little hope that this parliament can reach a bipartisan consensus when the coalition is led by someone who seems to have wandered far away from the truth and has perhaps just departed a flat earth society convention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Climate Change Authority's brief, to provide expert independent advice on climate change mitigation initiatives, is hardly revolutionary stuff. Labor set up the authority to ensure both the government of the day as well as the Australian public have the most comprehensive advice on how to expand Australia's renewable energy industry. It is chaired by a very reputable person, the former head of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, and it has a board of considerable expertise, consisting of highly qualified scientists—including Australia's Chief Scientist, Ian Chubb—economists, academics and professionals—just as the Australian people would expect: the most celebrated in the land gathered together to help us face the most significant challenges of our time. As a statutory body at arm's length from government, the CCA is able to provide an important independent voice to assist Australia's actions to mitigate the effects of climate change, without fear or favour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, perhaps, that is where the real problem lies for the Abbott coalition, because we have seen already this is a government addicted to secrecy and intrigue and seemingly obsessed with abolishing sources of independent advice which they cannot tamper with, distort or intimidate before they give their advice. Indeed, the government's first act in office was to sack senior public servants who had the temerity to do their job—that is, to provide frank and fearless advice for the government of the day. Sacking departmental heads Andrew Metcalfe, Don Russell and Blair Comley—as well as giving marching orders to Martin Parkinson from next year—clearly demonstrates the exact value the government places on frank and fearless advice. That is clearly none. What a dangerous stance to take—a government that refutes science, rails against fact and ignores or dismisses independent advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott coalition is trying to intimidate public servants and entire departments into submission. They do not want independent advice; they want an echo chamber. Greg Hunt is on the record stating his desired avenues for advice are from august bodies: the Bureau of Meteorology, the CSIRO and the environment department. But these are all bodies which are subject to government funding. Under the government's plan, they can censor, bury and distort findings from these departments at will. They have already gutted the funding for the CSIRO in a clumsy and very short-sighted effort to disrupt the work of some of our top scientists who are in the midst of producing critical research to benefit the nation. How can public servants at the environment department and the Bureau of Meteorology keep the public properly informed when their jobs are under constant threat from a government that seeks to remove anyone who dares to hold them to account?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott coalition has already dismantled the Climate Commission and is now going for the last body which still has the ability to publish independent advice, all because they do not like the headlines generated by its findings. This is the Abbott carbon con—dismantle the bodies that provide independent advice and smother all departmental advice before it sees the light of day. And it is not just departments. We have seen recently on display the coalition, in conjunction with sections of the press, running a campaign of intimidation against the independent national broadcaster, the ABC, for daring to publish reports that Australia spied on Indonesia. From the Prime Minister down, the coalition has criticised the ABC, with government ministers calling for its privatisation, break-up or funding to be cut—all for fulfilling its public duty of informing the public. Clearly they are not content with censoring the Public Service; they want to censor the press as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, when we take more than a moment to assess what passes as climate change policy in today's coalition, you can almost pity the government for wanting to hide its shame. A Fairfax Media survey of 35 economists found that only two economists supported the coalition's Direct Action plan—that is a fail on anybody's watch—and one of those was a self-declared climate change sceptic. Australian economist Professor Justin Wolfers, of the Brookings Institution in Washington and the University of Michigan, said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what would the OECD know by comparison to this government, who know everything, are the font of all wisdom and are not in need of independent frank or fearless advice as they have got it all figured out so we should just trust them! Somehow that does not ring true. Another claim from the OECD saw it dismissing Direct Action as a policy that 'entails higher costs to society per tonne of carbon dioxide abated—in many cases, substantially higher'.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Business Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group have also both questioned the viability of the direct action scheme. It is getting to the point where you have to think that they are very brave to even speak up and say anything at all in opposition to this new rule of government that we are seeing. The Ai Group bravely states that the direct action policy is 'unlikely to produce any meaningful reduction in carbon emissions'. And I suppose that is okay if you are not here to do meaningful things. If you are here to play the game of being in power, that perhaps is an explanation of why you might follow the path of direct action. The Business Council of Australia says that 'direct action is likely to put a very high impost on Australian taxpayers'. That is very concerning. That is intolerable—that is, not only pulling apart well-informed policy, agreed policy by experts, but to also put a burden on Australian taxpayers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the muddy mess that is the coalition's Direct Action Plan there is only one thing that is clear: it clearly fails even the most cursory of inquiries. By the government's own admission, direct action is a command-and-control scheme that places the government front and centre. Greg Hunt is on the record stating:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will simply buy back the lowest cost abatement instead of having to tax the whole economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="AI6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  I indicate my opposition to the government policy in relation to the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. What you have to understand, when you look at this little part of the coalition's anti-climate-change policy, is that this is about government secrecy. This is about ensuring that there is no independent authority having a look at the shambles of a policy called direct action—the policy that would require twice the area of Victoria to be planted out with trees to gain some of the climate CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> reduction that they claim they will achieve. It is about ensuring that that short-term policy, which has been roundly criticised from within the coalition as well as externally both by scientists and by economists, hides the incompetent development of this policy and the incompetence of the policy itself. It is about trying to shut down critiques. It is about saying on the one hand, 'We are about small government, we are about ensuring that the country gets value for money, we want a smaller bureaucracy', but on the other hand, because they were in trouble with the climate change policies, having to then establish a bureaucracy to hand out grants to polluters in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason for this bill is the ongoing secrecy that just completely envelopes this poor, incompetent government. It is saying: 'We do not want the public to know how incompetent we are in delivering this policy, how incompetent the policy is itself. Therefore, we will not have any analysis; we will not have any independent critique. We will have public servants out there arguing the government's position, and we will then describe them as the experts in this area.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know how that works in Canada, where the scientists have been closed down. The scientists have not been allowed by conservative governments in Canada to make any critiques of the Canadian government's position on climate change policy. They must clear every public statement through the Canadian minister. And who was one of the first governments that the Abbott coalition cosied up to? The Canadian government. You can just imagine the two conservative leaders sitting around a table, exchanging views on how you close down economic and scientific critiques of government policy; and the Canadian government telling the Liberal coalition here that you shut them down by making sure that a public servant cannot speak out on the environment, cannot speak out on science and cannot speak out for the public good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So that is what the alternative is. There is no alternative to the Climate Change Authority being an independent authority and actually analysing what is going on. The alternative is the Canadian model, and that is the model that the coalition government will try to implement—a model that is about secrecy and closing down analysis, closing down scientific critiques and closing down any advice to the public that does not match what this incompetent government wants to put out to the public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had only a short period of this government. I have to say that, if ever a honeymoon period came to a shuddering halt, it was with this coalition government. The public know they cannot trust the coalition: they cannot trust the coalition to look after them when they are in trouble; they cannot trust the coalition to look after the public good when they are facing bushfires in the Blue Mountains; and they cannot trust this government to provide proper support to communities in trouble. That is the short-term approach of the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the longer term, dealing with climate change and carbon pollution, this government cannot be trusted either, because this government is prepared to push the science aside, push the economics aside, come up with some stunt labelled 'direct action' and try to perpetrate a con job on the Australian public. The Australian public are onto this government. They have never been onto a government so quick as they have been onto this government. They understand that the government is incompetent. They understand that the government is untrustworthy. They understand that the government has got no policies in a whole range of areas. They now know that it has to set up 50 inquiries to try to develop some semblance of a government program moving forward, because there were no government programs in place other than three-line slogans on issues that are really about short-term political advantage and not the national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You see it writ large by this government day in and day out. Abolishing the Climate Change Authority so they can maintain their secrecy and antiscientific approach is just one of the ways that they deal with this. Let us look at them on education. How incompetent has any government been in this country? Talk about a double backflip with a pike. The coalition government have invented a new high-diving manoeuvre. I do not think anyone has ever seen contortions like the contortions of the coalition on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no wonder that the Australian public are going: 'We've been conned. We've been absolutely conned by this conservative government. They told us they would do all these things and, after they came to power, the issues that are important for the Australian nation are ignored and the issues that are pushed are part of the ideological agenda of the extreme right wing of the coalition, who don't believe in climate change, who don't believe in scientific endeavour, who don't believe in proper economics and who at one stage were talking about the market being the way forward.' The market is only the way forward for the coalition when it suits big business, but the market is not the way forward when it comes to trying to deal with climate change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, what the coalition want to do is put their hand in every person's pocket in this country—they want to take money out of your pockets—and hand it over to their big business mates, who are busily polluting this country with CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span>. That is what direct action is about: them putting their hand in your pocket, handing the money over to big business and pretending that that is what is going to deal with the climate change challenges for this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that every economist of any standing—other than the pet economists, the tame economists, of the coalition—says that you need to put a price on carbon to deal with CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> pollution not only here but around the world. That is why there are states in the United States that are picking up carbon pollution programs that deal with it through a market based system. They are putting a price on carbon. There is a price on carbon going in China. There is a price on carbon in the UK. There is a price on carbon in Europe. Why do they do that? They do that because they understand that, if you want to leave your economy dragging behind the rest of the world, you will not deal with carbon pollution, you will not have your industries adjust to a low-carbon economy and you will not create the new jobs that are demanded by a low-carbon economy. That is the problem we have with this coalition. They are not looking forward. It is about short-term political advantage pitted against the long-term economic reality of what is needed for a strong economy for the future. They deny the economics and the environmental science. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have a situation here where the government are untrustworthy and incompetent. They would rather see this economy stay in the past. They would rather see this economy not move forward while other economies are developing the technology and the jobs of the future, based on a low-carbon-footprint economy. And what are we going to have? We are going to have this nonsense called Direct Action that even the coalition members with any honesty recognise will never deliver for this country. The coalition are prepared to sacrifice future generations for their short-term political gain. They are prepared to sacrifice future generations to make sure that their electoral funds keep coming in from the mining companies and the power companies around this country—because that is what is driving it: their short-term political gain, the money that is pouring into them from the big business end of town, who do not want to have to address climate change. It is all about them. It is nothing about this nation. It is nothing about the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can see that clearly when you look at the position that the government have adopted on a range of major challenges, not just climate change and not just making sure that we are an economy for the future. In the car industry, it is their ideological bent that is driving their position. They do not like unionised, high-paid workers. So what do they do? They actually dare Holden, GMH, to leave the country. Day in, day out, they are goading one of the biggest employers in the country to pack up and go home. I do not know how that is in the national interest. I do not know how that can be seen to be a competent approach. It is simply being driven by the ideology of the coalition. They do not like unions. They do not believe in climate change. They do not want working people to get a fair go. They really would like to go back to Work Choices in industrial relations. We know that. They have reintroduced the ABCC, with draconian powers against workers. This is a government that is driven by ideological hatred. It is not driven by what is good for the country; it is driven by ideology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When people have recognised that, they have turned off very quickly, because you cannot trust the coalition. They are secretive, they do not want any accountability and they are prepared to do whatever they can to make sure that short-term politics drives their agenda. You see it every day in here. It is about short termism. It has got nothing to do with the future of this country. You see weak, sycophantic coalition members not prepared to stand up for their communities if there is a bushfire, not prepared to stand up for their communities when jobs are going to be destroyed. They are the weakest, most sycophantic backbench I have ever seen in this place. They will not stand up for their communities, they will not stand up for jobs, they will not stand up for the environment and they will not stand up for future generations. They are really a weird mob. They have got no values and no principles and they are prepared to drag this economy down if it means that they can go on some talkback show and get a pat on the back from Alan Jones or Andrew Bolt. That is what they are all about. They are going for a view that we should simply be a backward economy, with a backward government. This is the most backward government we have ever seen.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments fight hard to make changes. We say we want a fair go for the public school system in this country. What do the government do? Apart from setting about to destroy our environmental agenda, an agenda that is important for the long term, they say that, if you are a child of a rich person in this country then you will get looked after, you can go to a rich school and they will keep pouring money in there, but, if you go to a school in Penrith or you go to a school in the Blue Mountains or you go to a public school in Windsor, where I live—</span>

They will not stand up for Tasmania, will not stand up to get a fair go from the federal government. They capitulate—from the leader in here to Senator Bushby. They are vacillating, weak backbenchers, with absolutely no interest in what is here for the future. So what they are prepared to do, if, for example, it is a bushfire in the Blue Mountains, is to say, effectively, 'Never mind getting the same rights for the community in the Blue Mountains; we will give you government spin. We will put the government before the community.' It does not matter if it is jobs in the car industry: 'We will put the government before car industry workers.'</span>

                    </a>  Well, I think you need to read it carefully, Chair. The actions are clear from the coalition. They do not care about their local communities. They do not care about the education system. They do not care about the climate. They do not care about anything else other than themselves. As long as the money is pouring in from Gina Rinehart and Twiggy Forrest to make sure that their election coffers are kept well and truly balanced, then they do not care about anyone else. It does not matter if you have leaky roofs in the schools in Penrith. It does not matter if you do not have decent conditions in schools in Penrith; as long as the money goes to the private school system, they are happy. So we know what they are all about: they are all about looking after the big end of town, not anyone else.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why they want to get rid of the Climate Change Authority. That would be a check and balance on this terrible government the community has already said is no good, on a government that is one of the poorest ever to start off in this country. The public are onto them and onto them early. All these policies they said they would deliver are not going to be delivered unless it means crashing jobs for unionised workers in the car industry, unless it means destroying the environment for their short-term political gain. That is what they are about. They are the most hopeless government that has ever come in here. They have had the shortest honeymoon period of any government in the history of this country. They want to destroy the environment for the sake of their mates in big business. They have no capacity to stand up for the local communities. They have no capacity to stand up to big business. They will continue to run a position here that is economically illiterate and environmental vandalism. So I take the view that, the sooner we get to the next election and the sooner you lot are gone, the better, because that is in the interests of this country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M0R" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  I rise to contribute to this Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013 debate. Like my colleague Senator Cameron, I do so with a sense of frustration and anger at the thought that, through no other reason than an ideological obsession and political point-making exercise of the coalition, the Abbott government is attempting to undo the architecture that has been put in place around climate change and carbon pricing in this country. That ideology is not based on science or economics and, further, is damaging our reputation as an international player on climate change policy in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is that issue that I would like to first draw upon. The Climate Change Authority has provided high-quality, independent advice since its establishment in 2012 using expert scientists and economists in the domestic and international arenas. The Climate Change Authority has been referred to as similar to the Committee on Climate Change in the UK—something which is an independent statutory body established by the UK and had its stated purpose, similarly, to advise the UK government and its devolved administrations on emissions targets and report to parliament on progress made in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for climate change. That is very similar to the role that the Climate Change Authority has been carrying out. It has been providing vitally important information for tackling climate change and accelerating the roll-out of clean-energy jobs and clean energy itself in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But already we know that the coalition has abolished the climate commission. It has already, as we know, attempted to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Now it is attempting to abolish the Climate Change Authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, like the UK, this organisation is set up independently to provide expert advice about emissions reductions targets and the scope for ongoing emissions reductions in Australia. We know the international community is watching Australia, and has been watching very closely since 7 September, because of this fixation of the new government on repealing all the climate change architecture that was put in place by the former Labor government under the stewardship of the then minister, Greg Combet. They are watching because Australia will soon take over the leadership of the G20 and, when it does that, it has the ability to have strong and effective action in its leadership role against the issues of ongoing emissions, global issues of climate change and the like. So countries are recognising that Australia is going to take over that leadership role and are concerned that their hopes of any kind of strong and effective action on climate change will not be there under Australia's leadership, will be incredibly diminished under Australia's leadership as opposed to the position Australia took to the various international fora on climate change it participated in during the last government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite that, of course, Prime Minister Tony Abbott apparently does accept that climate change is happening. I think he said as much in a recent press conference in November. He said he accepts climate change is happening and humans are contributing to it. So, if the Prime Minister can say clearly now that he has been converted into this space that says climate change is happening—and I have to say I am pleased he has—then surely he needs to recognise that, in being the leader at the G20, he needs to take strong and effective action on climate change. If the coalition and the Prime Minister think Direct Action policy—which is the only thing they still have lingering somewhere on the table; it might be under a few documents and books, but I think it is still there as a coalition policy—is strong and effective action to take to the G20 table when we take over that leadership role, I think that the Prime Minister would be laughed out of the room, quite frankly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are already scientists, economists and a lot of independent think tank contributors in this space, who probably know a hell of a lot more than many of us here, coming out very clearly and saying that the coalition's Direct Action policy is simply not going to do anything near being effective or providing strong action on climate change. Many economists and scientists for some time now have been telling the coalition that their Direct Action policy is not good enough. They have been telling the coalition that an emissions trading scheme is the most efficient and effective way to tackle climate change, and in fact we know that there are members of the coalition government who think so themselves. Yet the coalition will continue to believe that Direct Action will be the best way forward, despite those economists and those scientists saying that Direct Action will not work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other very disappointing part of where we find ourselves with this bill before us is that it also shows that the coalition not only want to repeal the various parts of the architecture of climate change policy that we have in this country but also are now turning away from any kind of participation in international forums on this issue. I want to raise one particular one which has occurred recently, and that is of course the United Nations climate change talks in Warsaw in Poland. The Australian government was unable to send a ministerial representative to those talks. With negotiations from all over the world taking place in Warsaw, what kind of message does it send to the international community when Australia cannot even send a minister or a parliamentary secretary to those climate change talks? It is snubbing the international community on this issue. We all know that climate change is an international issue. That is why we were playing our part in introducing a climate change policy that included carbon pricing, moving to an emissions trading scheme: so that it would be part of an international economic framework for tackling climate change. Yet here Australia is, not even at the negotiating table. So it is not even that we are repealing the architecture we have; we are even turning our backs on the rest of the international community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is simply embarrassing, yet here we will be next year, at the G20, taking over that leadership, with all of those countries being very aware that since this government has come to power we have not participated on the international stage on this issue of climate change. I think that is absolutely appalling and shows how far backwards we have come from where we were prior to 7 September this year. I can only think of what the EU would be thinking of Australia right now. I know that it would not be in a very favourable light on the issue of climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it is not just economists and scientists who have come out very strongly about Direct Action not working and about an emissions trading scheme being the best way forward for tackling climate change. The chairman of the Climate Change Authority, to the abolition of which this bill pertains, has clearly come out calling on government to retain this independent body and not to abolish the Climate Change Authority. He has challenged some of the arguments put by government—I think by Environment Minister Greg Hunt—on the issue of closing this authority being about reducing bureaucracy and moving climate change advice into either the federal environment department, the CSIRO or the Bureau of Meteorology. He has challenged that, because this was about frank, fearless, good and independent advice coming from an independent body. That is what this authority is still able to provide, and that is what the Australian government will be giving up if they abolish it. I quote from the Chairman, Mr Bernie Fraser, who says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On a subject as complex as climate change, I would have thought every government—whatever its complexion—would want to get good independent advice … I find it a bit frustrating this opportunity … seems to be foreclosing a bit with the present government. I think that's a disappointment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is very much a disappointment and it is very similar to what we heard from the chairwoman of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, who similarly made an appeal to government to not axe the CEFC. So you have very respected, intelligent, well-known people in this climate change space in very important roles as chairpersons both pleading to government not to undo some of this architecture of climate change policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The comments by Minister Greg Hunt in relation to abolishing the Climate Change Authority and having the ability to get that same advice from inside bureaucracy from the CSIRO is quite bizarre because it was not long ago that this government was announcing cuts to the CSIRO. Not only is it expecting public servants to give independent advice but it is also asking for that advice from a body of the public service that has recently had an announcement of job cuts. That shows again that this government has certainly still got its training wheels on. I do not think those training wheels are going to come off for a very long time. In fact, I think more training wheels will need to be added.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about climate change policy, this government is all over the place. It is stuck and hell-bent on this ideology that it is against carbon pricing, that it is not going to have anything to do with being an effective leader on climate change policy. It is stuck on that approach. Despite the economists, despite the scientists it continues to trot out this mantra. Yet we know very well that there are key members of this government, some of whom are around that cabinet table, that were once very much for an emissions trading scheme, just like their then leader, Prime Minister John Howard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was actually the Howard government—the only thing I would give credit to the Howard government for—that had the foresight to look ahead and think, 'We need to be a part of this international fray. We need to act on climate change and the best way to do that is through the introduction of an emissions trading scheme.' Key members of this government were part of that belief with then Prime Minister John Howard. They are still there now yet they are continuing day after day to trot out this mantra that they are against pricing carbon, they are against an emissions trading scheme. They want put their heads in the sand into some direct action hole, which leads to nowhere. We have been told it leads to nowhere by the economists and by the scientists. All it does is leave Australia as a laughing stock in the international community. We came so far. We created the architecture for tackling climate change and for doing our bit in the international community. We were ready to start trading permits with the EU and were ready to have an emissions trading scheme, like so many parts of the world have introduced or are introducing. Now we have gone tenfold backwards and it is an embarrassment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, when we do take that leadership position at the G20 next year, it will all come to the fore that Australia's leadership will be lacking on climate change. This very serious issue has overwhelming evidence and the global issue of climate change needs to be taken seriously by our generation for the next generation and so on. That leadership will be lacking at the head of the G20 table by Australia and that is a sheer embarrassment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is time for this government to reflect upon what it has done, to move from its fixated ideology and recognise it needs to play a role in effective and strong leadership action on climate change. That action of course is not Direct Action. Direct Action is going nowhere and it is not just me saying this. So many independent thinkers in the community are saying this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Climate Change Authority acts very similarly to the UK's committee on climate change, which has also been providing independent advice on the issue of emissions reduction. To abolish this authority would be another step backwards, just as it was a step backwards to abolish the Climate Change Commission and just as it was a step backwards to attempt to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We need the architecture that we have in place on climate change so that we can play our part in the international community and, ultimately, reduce carbon emissions in this country.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WILLIAMS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  As you are aware, Acting Deputy President Fawcett, you were on the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee which held an inquiry into this very piece of legislation, the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. Senator Singh said, 'Yes we need international action.' That is exactly right. I wonder if Senator Singh can recall a former Prime Minister, Mr Kevin Rudd, just before the election, saying the carbon tax is costing people, is adding to the cost of living and is adding to the cost of doing business. He was correct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President Fawcett, that during the inquiry the National Farmers Federation said that the carbon tax was costing the average farm in Australia about $10,000, yet farmers have to compete in international markets where many—even most—have nowhere near that cost put on them for any climate change action. The dairy industry, which is competing in a domestic dollar-a-litre-for-milk war, is hurting financially and trying to survive. The truckies—the very people who literally carry our nation and transport everything from exports to the waterfront to supplies to our country towns around our nation—were going to be hit with another $515 million diesel tax on their diesel fuel under the former government's proposal. This was to occur just as the trucking industry introduced the Euro 4 and Euro 5 motors, which are far cleaner than, for example, the older Detroit diesels and the 14-litre Cummins I used to drive many years ago. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the refrigeration gas. This is amazing! An IGA owner in Central West New South Wales had a gas leak in his large refrigerator. He had to put 65 kilos of refrigerant gas back into it. Instead of costing him $26 a kilo, it cost him $150 a kilo. Instead of costing him around $1,650, it cost him $9,750. It cost him $8,000 more to top up the refrigerant gas after fixing the leak in his refrigeration system. I wonder who pays that $8,000? Of course it goes onto the price of the foods and groceries he sells, and the consumers pay for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cement industry is another industry that was hit very hard. We run the risk of shutting down our industries in Australia and see them moving to places like China where they emit more CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> when they process cement. The current scheme is not working.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was not amazed to read the column by Samantha Maiden in Sunday's paper, which said that we have virtually had no reduction in carbon dioxide emissions in Australia. In fact, the committee heard that the forecast of around 580 million tonnes of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> a year will rise to in excess of 620 million tonnes by the year 2020. There is no reduction. It will just go into the world scheme of emission trading where we will buy about $3.5 billion worth of permits from overseas, from countries who may well defraud and commit fraud in setting up their so-called carbon credits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the Department of Environment and, of course, it will remain. We have the CSIRO and we have the Bureau of Meteorology. We do not need this organisation, which is simply another cost to the taxpayers of Australia, especially businesses. I go back to Samantha Maiden's comments on Sunday that since the carbon tax was introduced—the tax that we were never going to have according to the commitment by former Prime Minister Ms Julia Gillard and former Treasurer Mr Wayne Swan—it has cost $24,000 per tonne of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> abatement. That is what it has cost the people of Australia and the industries of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have all of these troubles with the motor vehicle industry. The cost to them and to industry everywhere is unfair. It is currently at $24.15 a tonne, which is the most expensive carbon tax in the world. As I said, former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd admitted that in run-up to the 7 September election. He said, 'The carbon tax has got to go. Let's have a cheaper emissions trading scheme for a little while until it goes up to a projected $38 a tonne by the year 2020.' Since the previous government, under pressure from the Greens and Independents Rob Oakeshott and Tony Windsor, introduced a scheme that is not working, it has cost Australian business and the Australian people $24,000 a tonne. It is not getting rid of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> emissions; it is getting rid of jobs. That is all that it is doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said thousands of times, the Australian people were quite clear about how they voted on 7 September and what our policies were. One policy was to abolish the carbon tax, and another was to abolish the mining tax. That is exactly what will happen. We will go back to the people if it does not. So come to accept that the carbon tax is not working, is a cost on our nation and our businesses, is transferring business and jobs overseas, is having no effect in Australia and is hugely expensive. That is why this bill that we are debating now is part of the carbon tax abolition policies that we went to the people with and that they clearly voted for. This was in a case where the Australian Labor Party had its lowest primary vote for 110 years, dating back to 1903. If they are going to stand in the road, the people will decide.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAULKNER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  Having listened to the recent contributions of Senator Singh and Senator Williams, I too have decided to make a short contribution to this debate on the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. I am very concerned, and I think all senators should be very concerned, that if this bill is passed and if the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill becomes law, it would significantly weaken Australia's ability to understand and tackle climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we need to acknowledge that climate change is a complex issue for all governments. Not just the Australian government, but for the entire international community. It is complex in relation to its environmental aspects. It is complex in relation to its economic aspects, and it is complex in relation to its social aspects. As the scientific case for climate change grows stronger and stronger, so does the importance of taking responsible and effective action to minimise its impacts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that the facts are that dealing with climate change is assisted by an agency like the Climate Change Authority, so that all the elements, all the key strands of environmental, planning, economic and social research can be brought together and so that quality, expert advice can be provided to government. The Climate Change Authority should remain to provide the highest quality advice on climate policy, to take into account expert scientific and economic advice and to take into account developments in the international arena. I say that expert advice should be treasured, not junked; climate change policy should be directed by evidence and facts rather than by fear and prejudice and political opportunism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Climate Change Authority was designed to take all the short-term, mindless and silly politics out of the climate change debate. In this regard, of course, the Climate Change Authority in Australia has many similarities to the United Kingdom's Committee on Climate Change. I think it is worth the Senate noting that successive British governments, governments of differing political persuasions, have benefited from such advice. Australians, in my view, deserve an approach to tackling climate change that respects the scientific and economic consensus, where facts, not fear, set and drive public policy. Of course, the Climate Change Authority here in Australia is already providing this advice—providing strong advice based on scientific and economic evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we can acknowledge that it is for government and for the parliament to decide how they might respond to the advice they receive. We all accept that. However, I fear that, without such advice, government strategy and government decision making about climate change will be less than adequate—will be ad hoc and will be uninformed. Of course, I suppose to some extent the risk is that it will be informed, but by focus groups and the ignorant, not by experts. Abolishing the Climate Change Authority is a short-term political gesture that is simply not in the national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true, I think, and fair to say, that the Climate Change Authority has a strong record in providing independent, frank and fearless advice to government on a range of critical matters: matters such as Australia's emissions reduction targets and caps for carbon pricing; matters such as progress towards meeting our medium- and long-term emissions reduction targets; matters such as the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting System; matters such as carbon farming; and matters such as the renewable energy target. The advice that is provided on these critically important aspects of climate change policy must be based on scientific and economic research and it must be independent, and that is the advice received from the Climate Change Authority. That is the advice; that is its nature. I say that independence is essential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Climate Change Authority's board has an excellent scientific, economic, industry and also academic pedigree, making the authority well placed to deliver considered and expert advice to government. We must acknowledge in this debate that the Climate Change Authority uses evidence based policy. The Climate Change Authority is an important tool in the battle to avoid dangerous climate change. It is an important tool for any federal government, whatever its political persuasion, so the government can be assisted in developing and reviewing climate change policies. I say that the Climate Change Authority is the right body to do this job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the opposition whip in the Senate has a close interest in this, so much so that she is waving her hands. Were you waving them at me? It is rare in the chamber, as you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President Stephens, to have such a level of support that the opposition whip would enter the chamber and wave her hands in support of a speaker. I suspect even Senator Williams and Senator McKenzie have never seen such extraordinary support provided by the whip of any major political party to a mere humble backbencher on his feet in a debate like this. I am really knocked over by that level of support.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting rid of the Climate Change Authority would mean that Australia would no longer be taking the battle against climate change seriously. It is as simple as that. Despite the scepticism of some, the reason temperatures are rising is not an issue of serious debate. As I have on so many occasions now over many years, I want to stress the issue of climate change science, because the overwhelming majority of scientists agree that human activity is the principal cause of climate change. The evidence is in: humans are responsible for climate change. The evidence is compelling, it is unequivocal and it is growing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that there are some who wish to argue a different position. I accept that opponents of the scientific basis of climate change are entitled to their view, but I do not expect such views to be taken seriously, because global warming is not a giant conspiracy. It is not an abstract theory, but part of a new reality that we all face—that Australia faces; that every nation in the world faces. As I say, I have spoken for many years now on many occasions about the science of climate change. It should be a guide to what we do because the science of climate change is becoming surer, not less certain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would refer interested senators to the International Panel on Climate Change and its most recent report. I do not want to traverse the ground that I covered in a recent speech in the Senate about that report. Suffice to say the IPCC predicts that if carbon dioxide emissions only increase at the minimal rate, then global average temperature could rise by 0.9 degrees to 2.3 degrees Centigrade by the end of the century. But, if the worst-case scenario is met, this could be as much as 3.2 to 5.4 degrees Centigrade. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at our most recent experiences in Australia—not what might happen, but what actually has happened. Australia has just experienced its warmest September ever; its hottest summer day on record, 7 January 2013; its warmest winter day on record, 31 August 2013. And this year, 2013, is on track to be the warmest year on record. According to the World Meteorological Organization, all the warmest years across the planet have occurred since 1998. Even the coldest years are warmer than anything before 1998. This means we are committed to a warmer future—so you better get used to it. These numbers cannot be fudged, they cannot be spun, and nor should anybody try to do so. Increasing average temperatures is affecting human health; it affects animals, it affects plants, it affects agriculture, it affects industry—it affects so many parts of our lives. It is also having knock-on effects on the weather, as we know, with a warming ocean increasing the intensity of storms and melting the polar icecaps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. So I say yet again: it is crucial that we focus on the science of climate change and that we consider the most efficient methods of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To do this Australia needs long-term bipartisan strategies in place, based on expert advice, so it is so short-sighted to abolish the Climate Change Authority. That is why the opposition opposes the legislation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0V" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WILLIAMS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  I rise today to speak about the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal and the role it plays in the safety of our truckies. The mission statement of the tribunal is listed as: firstly, making road safety remuneration orders; secondly, approving and assisting with negotiations for road transport collective agreements; thirdly, dealing with certain disputes related to road transport drivers, their employers or hirers and participants in the supply chain; and, fourthly, conducting research into pay, conditions and related matters that could affect safety in the road transport industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take you back to March 2012 when this legislation was before the Senate—and I respect those who are now opposite, people like Senator Sterle, about needing more safety in the transport industry. The last thing we want to see is our truckies—or anyone for that matter—killed on our roads. I made the comment then that I had no major problems with the legislation, but I queried whether it would be the silver bullet to prevent deaths. I warned at the time that the tribunal should not be stacked with members of the Transport Workers Union. In fact, I said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Have people on the tribunal from the transport industry—people who know the industry and who are in the industry—not just those who are representing the workers. Then, and only then, will you see fairness in the tribunal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I sat down with the Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters Association. This is a group that represents hardworking road transport companies and workers, many of them based in small communities of regional and rural Australia, who provide the first and last link of the supply chain for Australia's agriculture industry. I see them every day of the week when I am home in Inverell. There are truckies bringing the cattle into the Inverell abattoirs and truckies then taking the containers off to the waterfront at Brisbane, providing a vital service to industry to survive and providing food not only to Australians but also to thousands, perhaps millions, of people around the world. The Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters Association supports the review of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal—and I will get to that review in more detail later. It said to me that there are problems in the industry that need addressing such as payment time frames and payment for all work time including waiting and washing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at their particular concerns. The association has grave concerns about two aspects of the draft Road Safety Remuneration Order. These are the requirements for mandatory written contracts and for safe-driving plans. What I am getting to is red tape and paperwork that will not achieve anything. It will not provide safety and will be of no benefit. When you put this extra red tape and costs onto our truckies, who pays for it? I am talking livestock transport here. They have to do out a plan and a contract, which means more time for the grazier or the farmer, as we know, who is running the sheep and cattle or perhaps even goats. So it is more cost to the grazier, the landowner—our food-providers, if you want to call them that—and who pays more to the farmer? No-one does. They are the price-takers. They will cop the burden, as always. It makes a very good case for special circumstances requiring the ongoing use of verbal contracts in the rural and remote transport sector—not a written contract, not a written driving plan, a plan of the route the truckie is going to take, but a verbal plan, and I will get to that more in a minute as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hardly any work carried out by livestock transporters or grain carriers is done under an ongoing written contract. It is seasonal work. The wheat harvest is now coming to a conclusion in many areas. It has finished up in the north of the state in Queensland, though, sadly, not with very good crops this year because of the dry winter. Down south in New South Wales and into Victoria, there are very good crops but late frosts have caused damage. There are the truckies out there carrying the wheat to the silos and perhaps even storing in sheds on the farm. Some obviously have made it to parts of consumption.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If it is seasonal work, jobs are allocated here and there. It is very random. Certainly, some carriers could be on a retainer with regular work, such as feedlot to abattoirs, consistent business contracts, or carting grain to feedlots for the fattening of steers for market. But because of the very nature of the work, the truckie could be a subcontractor one day and prime contractor the next, so it is changeable and there should be flexibility. The truck cab becomes their office and their work regime is vastly different from that of someone running up and down the east coast of Australia on an interstate trip. Quite simply, mandatory written contracts are not always possible or feasible, and oral contracting must be allowed to continue. The Fair Work Act does say that a contract may be written or oral.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now to the other worry, mandatory safe-driving plans. The Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters Association point out to me that it is just not practical for a safe-driving plan to be agreed to between the hirer and the contractor for short-notice, long-distance work—let alone require others in the supply chain to witness the arrangements. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give an example. A very good friend of mine is someone I became very good friends with very early in 1960 when we walked into school as five-year-olds. He runs a double-deck sheep and a single-deck cattle truck in South Australia in Jamestown where I grew up. He may get a call today asking if he can come up to Umberatana Station tomorrow to take a load of sheep out, about 220 wethers. What paperwork has he got to go through? He has been up to the Flinders Ranges a hundred times. He knows the road. He might have to take them down to the Adelaide saleyards. When he gets there they might say, 'Look, 100 of the wethers were a bit light-on in weight. We are now going to put these 100 dry ewes on. They are weighing better.' So once again his load has changed. This is paperwork. There is nothing wrong with oral contracts, and the fair work legislation says that. What I am saying is we need flexibility, not more paperwork to achieve nothing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said when I started, Senator Sterle is a passionate supporter of the truckies and the transport industry, and I am the same—we have both changed plenty of gears in our life. We want to see people safe, but we do not want to see the industry swamped with paperwork without flexibility. The Australian Livestock and Rural Transport Association pointed out to me that it is just not practical for a safe driving plan to be agreed between the hiring contractor for short-notice, long-distance work, let alone to require others in the supply chain to witness the arrangements. If I am on a property in northern South Australia and I ring up a truckie and say, 'Could you do a load of sheep for me?' it is a minute's notice. It might be urgent. They might say, 'There is rain coming in two days' time. You've got to get up this dirt track, in through the station track and get out.' Who is going to witness the arrangements?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I am saying is that there are laws in place governing fatigue, and we need to see that those laws remain, but do not add another layer of complex regulation and costs. I could take you back to the seventies when I was driving trucks, and really it was a farce. It was dangerous. We would go to places like Coober Pedy through 500 kilometres of terrible road, corrugations and bulldust holes. The trailer brakes were full of dust—just red sand like sandpaper—and often they were too far worn out or out of adjustment. They were dangerous days. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps what kept us safe is that we could not go fast. We used to work on an average of 50 kilometres an hour when we went on a trip. We had little horsepower, the trucks were not powerful like today. We had 200 horsepower carting three decks of sheep, two decks of cattle, and if you were not going up the gearbox, you were going down it all day. We could only go along slowly, and that is probably what saved a lot of us from having accidents. Today it is different. A 600-horsepower truck can go along at 100 kilometres up and down. </span>
              </p>

                  </a>  That is more dangerous. You know that.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WILLIAMS:</span>
                  </a>  What I am saying is that those days were extremely dangerous because we did not have the regulations. We would go into Adelaide after being up a rough track for 500 kilometres and half the lights on the side of our trailers would not be working because the globes had fallen out. We would just clean up and put the globes back in—we just wanted to get there and get the stock unloaded. There was a case where you did not have to abide by your logbook while carting livestock—you were excluded. We drove too long, we got too tired—they were crazy days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I make the point that Labor and their partners, the Greens, have already done enough damage to the Australian transport industry. The carbon tax was due to start in July next year with the fuel tax credits to be cut by 6.8c per litre. Thankfully the Australian people threw them out in September. Putting another $500 million cost on our truckies and our diesel will achieve what? I will tell you what. The best comment that came out of the Senate inquiry was that of Mr Tony Sheldon, the Transport Workers Union boss. He said two words: death tax. That is how he described an extra $500 million tax on our truckies—a death tax that would sweat the trucks and sweat the drivers. Thankfully it is not going ahead.</span>
              </p>

                  </a>  I rise on a point of order. That is a blatant lie from Senator Williams. Tony Sheldon is the only one sticking up for truck drivers in this country, apart from the good supporters of Labor on this side of the chamber. Not one of those on the other side of the chamber are standing up for Australia's truck drivers, and that should be withdrawn. It is an absolute lie and it is a disparagement of Tony Sheldon's character.</span>

                  </a>  The truth does hurt some, doesn't it? What about the live export ban Senator Ludwig implemented in 2001? Talk about being led by the nose. What did that do to the truckies in the Top End? They were put out of work. The trucks were standing idle while we lost the 750,000 head of live exports to Indonesia because of your Prime Minister at the time, Ms Julia Gillard. That is who not knocked that off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point I make about this is: do not swamp our regional truckies—who are carting their livestock to the abattoirs, to the market and feeding Australia—with paperwork. The oral contracts are part of the fair work legislation, and if you are going to put paperwork on them, who is going to pay for it? They will pass it down the line to the primary producer. Who does the primary producer pass the cost on to? They have no-one to pass it on to—and we wonder why the average age of a farmer is 58 years of age. Why are the young ones not going on to the farm? It is because the profit is not there, and I salute the new agriculture minister, Mr Barnaby Joyce, for his white paper into the farm-gate price.</span>

No reduction in emissions whatsoever. Are we going to burn less fuel? No, their trucks will still burn eight billion litres of fuel a year. That is the case. Do not swamp our stock drivers and carriers with paperwork to achieve nothing. They are at call, as I said. A typical example is that they get a call from a station owner: 'Can we get this stock out before the rain comes?' What are they supposed to do, sit down for hours and go through paperwork? Who is going to agree to it all? It is outrageous. The Fair Work Act says that an oral contract is binding and that should be stuck to exactly. So that is the situation.</span>

                  </a>  I agree with you, Madam Acting Deputy President; thank you very much. So that is the point I make. I support safety on the road and I support safety for our truckies by whatever we can do. We have got the national road safety plan coming into place and the national regulations, and the sooner they get here the better so we do not have different weights in different states and all the red tape. But I do not want to see the paperwork swamping them and just being thrown around. We have already got too much paperwork when small businesses, especially owner-drivers, are trying to survive; it is more time and more cost to them, and all so they can do the paperwork. So you are trying to run a small business and the paperwork is swimming all around you and you are drowning in it, and I do not want to see more paperwork. So, regardless of what Senator Sterle says, let us see that people can actually run their business in this country without being swamped by red tape and regulation.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  This summer, Australia meets the old enemy on cricket pitches across the country. At stake is the Ashes urn and Australia's sporting pride after a crushing tour of England earlier this year, and so far Australia is making quite a comeback. There is no love lost between players once they walk out of the pavilion. While we have moved on from bodyline, the verbal barrage between players is as fierce as it has ever been. Test cricket is a competitive game, and a trial of mental as much as physical endurance. While we might worry about that attitude being emulated by our children, both sides maintain the view that there are no points for hurt feelings in professional cricket.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cricket is like other sports in that respect. In the arena of aggressive, high-stakes competition, there are no rules against being offended, except in one important respect. Every professional sport beloved by Australians has serious and strict prohibitions on racially motivated comments and conduct. Racial equality is at the heart of genuine sporting contests. Only when all people are welcomed to the game can we have a genuinely international contest. And only when sport is played without prejudice can we witness a genuine challenge of human endeavour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equality makes victory so much sweeter and defeat all the more galvanising. That is why the laws of cricket make no distinction between people of different race, instead assuming that everybody has the right to fully participate. Opponents meet on a level playing field, with mutual respect and a shared determination to prevail. When treated as a place of mutual respect, cricket matches have demonstrated their capacity to break down barriers and bring nations together. Like other international sports, cricket's competitors and supporters come from an array of nations and a diverse range of backgrounds. Spectators lining grandstands and hills at ovals around Australia have been able to enjoy the spectacle of friendly rivalry without descending into rivalry themselves. But that picture of harmony relies on a conscious effort on the part of sporting organisations to prevent prejudice creeping into the game.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Repeated instances of racial vilification, in Australia and across the world, have led to the International Cricket Council, the ICC, introducing one of the toughest anti-racism and diversity codes in world sport. Under the ICC code, members, like Australia, are required to impose punishments on spectators found to have participated in offensive conduct on the basis of race, from ejection from the venue to a life ban. The point of the ICC's strict rules against racially motivated abuse is not that the cricket pitch is home to sensitive souls. It is that racial abuse is a different category of thing entirely and something that undermines the very point of cricket in the first place: to join people together in a spirit of friendly competition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ICC's rules are very similar to a law introduced in Australia in 1994. Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, which was introduced under the Keating government and applied consistently throughout the Howard government, prohibits conduct that is likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate someone on the basis of their race, colour or national or ethnic origin. This section, which has been in place for almost 20 years now, was introduced to give people some way to deal with words and actions that attacked them or their fellow citizens simply for being of a particular ethnic background. The law recognises that a community as rich and diverse as Australia's only functions properly when people act in a respectful and responsible way towards each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, like the ICC's code, it is not designed just to stop people from getting their feelings hurt. In fact, the courts have always set the bar for breaches of this law much higher than somebody simply being offended. The types of attacks this law defends against are the ones that have the potential to do serious harm to people or to undermine the harmony of our multicultural community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The kinds of extreme hate speech that Section 18C has covered, for example, include claims that Jewish people exaggerated the scale of the Holocaust for their own benefit or an overtly racist attack on an Indigenous Australian in front of her family. Such racially motivated attacks are too often precursors to racially motivated violence. In other instances, a lifetime of such abuse without any means of redress can cause terrible trauma. Either way, these are examples that reasonable Australians understand have no place in a community based on equality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the federal Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis, has pledged during the election that he would amend or repeal Section 18C because, in his view, it violates freedom of speech. Senator Brandis believes that racially motivated attacks are part and parcel of the 'intellectual freedom' Australians expect, despite there already being broad exemptions under 18D from current laws where people make infringing statements in good faith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The case Senator Brandis most often refers to when promoting his changes is that of columnist Andrew Bolt. In that case, Mr Bolt's comments were found to not have been made in good faith—particularly that he knowingly published errors of fact and distortions of the truth. If he had a sincere intellectual point to make, it would have avoided infringement of 18C. Senator Brandis has chosen to listen to the man on the losing end of a Federal Court case rather than to be guided by the ethnic communities who are affected by laws on racial discrimination every day. If the Attorney-General were to engage in genuine community consultation, he would realise how important these laws are to communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent weeks, 10 peak ethnic organisations have expressed their alarm over the threatened changes that are being proposed by this government. They believe that giving licence to racial vilification is un-Australian and that this would be a step backwards for Australia. Organisations have continued to speak out, and there have been a number of them, with the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples, the Australian Hellenic Council, the Arab Council Australia, the Vietnamese community, the Chinese Australian Forum and the Executive Council of Australian Jewry providing a media release on 21 November titled 'Racism is not free speech. It says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The proposal to change the RDA is being put forward in the name of free speech. Vilifying entire groups of people because of their race has nothing to do with free speech. To be vilified because of one’s ethnicity or national origin hurts one’s ability to participate fully in society.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since that statement was made, many other voices around the country have also spoken out. In fact, in Victoria on 5 December, a similar media statement was released, supported by 25 different organisations in Victoria. These included the Asian Australian Alliance, the African Think Tank, the Council of Christians and Jews, the Chinese Community Association Victoria, the Islamic Council of Victoria, the Hindu Foundation in Victoria, the UNESCO Chair in Interreligious and Intercultural Relations-Asia Pacific at Monash University, the Victorian Council of Churches, the Uniting Church in Australia's synod of Victoria and Tasmania, and so on and so on. Many organisations, all speaking out; individuals also speaking out about these threats that are being put forward if 18C were to be amended or repealed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But an even more significant step occurred yesterday when a broad coalition of organisations sent a joint open letter to the Attorney-General. There were more than 150 organisations from all around Australia highlighting the critical role that the Racial Discrimination Act has long played in combating racial hatred and protecting individuals and groups against discrimination and hate speech. Now 150 organisations: that sends a fairly strong message to the Attorney about how so much of civil society feels about this important issue. But it was a broad range of organisations, and I want to highlight some of them. They were not just ethnic communities; they included the Australian Lawyers Alliance, the ACTU, the YWCA, the Australian Council of Social Service, Amnesty International Australia, Oxfam Australia, the Lowitja Institute and the Refugee Council of Australia. This sends an incredibly strong message to this government about their position on any changes to our Racial Discrimination Act.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to quote the Executive Director of the Human Rights Law Centre, Mr Hugh de Kretser, who said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Racial hatred causes serious harm to individuals and the current law balances freedom of speech with freedom from vilification.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, Rodney Dillon from Amnesty International Australia said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples experience racism and hate speech on a regular basis … Strong legal protections send a clear message that racist hate speech is not acceptable and that people who experience such treatment will be protected by the law.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A similar message from Joe Caputo, Chair of the Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The repeal of section 18C would be incredibly damaging, sending a signal that hate speech is acceptable and allowing racism to get a foothold in our proudly multicultural nation …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Whether you are on a sporting field or walking down the street, racism and racial vilification have no role to play in our community. It is unacceptable and it causes harm to that person and their family, it cuts to the core of who that person is …</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And finally, this from Dr Cassandra Goldie, the CEO of the Australian Council of Social Service:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Several high profile incidents in recent years demonstrate that we still have a long way to go as a community and that laws protecting people from racial vilification are necessary …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There lie a number of examples of civil society, of individuals, speaking strongly, speaking to the Attorney in an open letter sent to him yesterday about how they regard any changes to these laws that protect against racial vilification.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These organisations and individuals should use those rules to defend what is right and to show that hatred and hate speech is wrong. We should not accept the excuse that racially motivated vilification is an ordinary and acceptable part of living in a democracy. Behaviour that is not acceptable in sport certainly should not be acceptable in everyday life. And just as sport does not work when we let racist language invade the pitch, Australian multiculturalism does not work when we let racism and hatred pry our communities apart. If we are to build a society where people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds feel able to fully participate, and where people can play and work and live side by side, then we also need a code of conduct against racially motivated abuse. We need to defend 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  I rise today to speak about what Christmas is like for single parents and other people trying to survive on income support, such as those who live below the poverty line on Newstart, and those on low incomes. These people do not necessarily look forward to Christmas because it is a very vulnerable time of year for them. Not only do they have to deal with what could be a bleak Christmas but they are also looking at what the future will hold for them over the next 12 months. It is with great sadness that I draw attention in this place again to the fact that we have a large group of Australians who are living below the poverty line. They cannot look forward to a Christmas they can share joyfully with their children. They are yet again wondering how they can make ends meet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke about a similar issue at this time last year when single parents in Australia were facing being dumped on Newstart. Unfortunately, Newstart has been the reality for those single parents and their families for 12 months. It is not a pretty picture. Last year we were deeply concerned about what the future held for those single parents and their families because they were dumped on Newstart, which is up to $120 a week below what they were trying to survive on on parenting payment single.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How are these parents doing now? How are their families doing now? Unfortunately, the government cannot tell us. It is a complicated story. The Howard government dumped the first group of single parents on Newstart and then the Labor government dumped another lot of those grandfathered parents on the single parenting payment. There has been no systematic monitoring and review of how these changes are impacting these single parents, most of whom are single mothers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While some people have managed to move into work, we do not know about the appropriateness of that work, whether they are holding down a number of jobs—and I know a couple of examples of people doing that to make ends meet—how many had to give up study and who is looking after their children if they have taken on more working hours. We do know that most families are living in poverty. We do know that these families are living on Newstart and that means that they are living significantly below the poverty line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the school holidays approach I know that most single-parent families are contemplating how they will care for their children and continue to work. The briefing note from the Productivity Commission released last Friday showed that, for a family on the minimum wage, the cost of putting a single child into all-day care is nine per cent of their disposable income. Of course, these are parents who are getting less than the minimum wage or are working only part time. Many single parents cannot afford to put their children into child care during the school holidays. Those who are lucky enough to find work and are able to juggle their work and parenting commitments do not know what to do during the school holidays. I know some who have had to give up work because they do not have satisfactory caring arrangements. So it is back to Newstart, back to poverty and back to trying to find more work after the school holidays.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A single mother rang my office just last week desperate and depressed. She told me that she has decided not to pay the rent in the coming week because the kids need to be fed. That is the choice she had to make. She had to choose between paying the rent and feeding the children. This new government has been talking about wanting to expand income management into new areas and it is carrying out an urgent review of this failed policy. One indicator of vulnerability is housing, so if the government has its way and a single parent cannot pay their rent because they have to feed their kids then that single parent might be subject to income management in that brave new world of expanded income management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of the lack of government monitoring since last year about the impact of this policy on single parents, their families and the community services they have to rely on for support, I made a point of speaking to charity and community organisations about the impact that the parenting payment cuts have had. In my home state of Western Australia I undertook a survey of providers. I asked how they were going this year and if they had had an increase in the number of people calling on their services. All but four of the 31 organisations said that the demand for their services had increased during 2013. Almost half said that they had been unable to meet the demand. They identified housing affordability, access to mental health services and inadequacy of income support payments as the top priorities for government action. These are areas in which we need the government to be showing leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just today there are reports of charities in my home state of Western Australia experiencing high demand for assistance as we approach Christmas. Foodbank has found a nine per cent increase in the number of people looking for food donations this year compared to last year. The Salvos have said that some requests may need to be turned down. This is the reality that single parents face this Christmas. From Foodbank's past reports, we know that in general a third of their requests for help have been from single-parent families. It is fair to assume that single-parent families are part of the increasing demand. For many, the new year is shaping up to be even harder. All the signs from the government are that more and more areas where assistance and support are currently provided to those on Newstart, single-parent families and low-income families will be hit by budget cuts. As a result, household budgets which are already stretched past breaking point will be under even more pressure. Let us look at some of these areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The schoolkids bonus is one of the cuts the government are looking to make as they propose to get rid of the mining tax. We know that education is absolutely fundamental to children's wellbeing and to their wellbeing when they become adults. We know that education is a critical part of getting out of living in poverty. After the Christmas break and summer holidays, the return to school is a tough time from many parents, particularly single parents. Last year single parents were being advised, when they were dumped onto Newstart, to rely on the schoolkids bonus to help them get by and pay the bills. The reality is that the cost of uniforms, books, school fees, sporting activities and the other usual costs associated with education are hard to bear if you are on a low income. They are even harder if you are a single parent trying to get by on very little money. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This cut will hurt the most vulnerable members of our community, the very children that everybody says they are committed to helping not live in poverty. It is a complete farce. The government say that they are trying to look after people in our community and yet they are cutting the very payments that people who are living in poverty rely on and survive on. The schoolkids bonus is one of the three areas of support and assistance that are being cut back as the government move to abolish the mining tax. Rather than working to ensure that Australians benefit from our natural resources, the government are putting the multinationals before the most vulnerable in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mining tax repeal is responsible for another cut—which shows the real undercurrent of cruelness in the approach that is being taken—and that is the axing of the income support bonus. This has been described as being to help people on certain income support payments prepare for unexpected living costs. At the moment, this payment is $105.80 if you are single, and it is paid twice a year. As I said in the chamber when this measure was passed in the first place, it amounts to less than the price of a cup of coffee a week. I acknowledge that, but, when you are living below the poverty line, when you are robbing Peter to pay Paul each week and making those decisions about whether you pay the rent or put food on the table, every cent is essential. That money comes into a budget that is so desperately thin that it helps. And yet it is going to be taken away. It is not insignificant to the people who are trying to survive on such a little amount of money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have the low income superannuation contribution, which the government have also said they are going to cut. That is designed to help those on low and fixed incomes under $37,000 a year, to help them build up even a modest amount of money for their retirement. It will have a disproportionate effect on women. Industry Super Australia has said that axing the rebate will affect around two million working women, including 80 per cent of female part-time workers. How can you expect people to be financially secure and independent in their retirement if they are stuck in poverty, living below or close to the poverty line and yet you deprive them of opportunities to save for their super? Again, this is hitting the most vulnerable members of our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just the younger members of our community that I am talking about. They are not the only ones that are at threat from this poor policymaking. If you look at some of the information that was received during questioning in estimates, it shows that there has been a 28 per cent increase in the number of Australians aged over 50 who have been on Newstart since 2010. There was a noticeable jump in these figures which coincided with the January single-parent payment cuts. On top of that, there is the reality that many traditional industries, such as manufacturing, are in decline. So we have got workers who are being forced out of employment without a strong set of transferable skills to help them into employment in a different industry. We have got, again, a group of single parents here. We know that jump in the figures was associated with single parents being forced onto Newstart. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People aged over 50 in the workplace, older workers, have been subject to age discrimination and ageism. They are not getting adequate support to be able to develop their skills and get training that meets their needs, and they face multiple and significant barriers to employment. At present, Job Services simply are not meeting their needs. They are left stuck on Newstart for extended periods of time. That means that they are living in poverty and it also means that they are not able to build up savings and super contributions for their retirement. In other words, potentially this group of people are stuck permanently in poverty, without an opportunity to get out of it. We must address the issues around Newstart and ensure that people are not living in poverty. Newstart is $134 below the poverty line. We need to make sure we increase Newstart, improve Job Services and tackle, front-on, ageism and age discrimination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue for people living on low income, older workers and single parents faces those who live in permanent mobile residences in lifestyle parks and caravan parks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is happening around Australia but I have also had a lot of contact from people in my home state of Western Australia, particularly from Busselton. Many of the regional centres, as well, have these particular areas because it is cheaper to live there. They received notices earlier in the year, which they were very upset about, from the owners of the villages saying that the ATO has drafted a ruling which would see the GST charged on rents paid by residents in lifestyle villages and similar accommodation increases; they are talking about moving the GST from 4.5 per cent to 10 per cent. This is deeply concerning to them. People live in these villages, in these mobile residences, because they are cheaper and they cannot afford to live in other accommodation. Reports suggest that there are 10,000 people living in these homes around Australia and the proposed change would see residents paying an increase in rent of between $15 and $30 per week, forcing people to make cuts in areas such as food, health care and community involvement. These are significant cuts for people who are trying to survive on the pension or on Newstart. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="H6X" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  I rise to speak on a matter of significant public interest, and that is the proper functioning of this legislative chamber. It is of particular concern to me and to senators on this side in the government that we are facing an unprecedented situation in the Senate in terms of the approach being taken by the opposition and the majority minor party, the Australian Greens, in terms of blocking the proper functioning of activities and workload within the Senate chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my 6½ years in this chamber I have seen it in various iterations. There was a period of time when, in government, the coalition senators of the Liberal and National parties held a one-seat majority. That continued through to the period after the 2007 election, when for a period of time coalition senators continued to hold a one-seat majority. Since then we have seen the circumstance of a hung Senate, where individual senators, like Senator Xenophon, and then Senator Fielding, exercised a balance of power; and since the last Senate election we have seen a situation where the Australian Greens, together with the Labor Party, hold a majority in the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What strikes me, as we move through another change of government, and one where we still have a Labor-Greens majority in the Senate, is that with the Labor-Greens majority this chamber is functioning very differently to how it functioned after the 2007 election when we had a coalition majority in the Senate. At that time—and I was part of the then new opposition—we agreed to things like extended sitting hours. We are willing to actually work in this place to allow the full debate. We may not have agreed to guillotine legislation or guillotine ourselves but we were willing to undertake the extra hours to ensure we had proper debate in this chamber. We were willing to undertake and accept that the government of the day had a right to have its legislation debated and voted on. It is the right of those opposite—and of any member of this place—to vote against any piece of legislation or proposal before this chamber. But it is the responsibility of senators in this place to work to allow matters to come to a vote, and it is irresponsible in the extreme to be in a situation where we simply do not see business progressed or dealt with and matters actually come to a vote properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the new government took office we have seen but a handful of bills actually pass this place. Three in total, I believe, have thus far managed to pass the Senate in the several weeks of sittings that have taken place. Contrast that with the House of Representatives, where several dozen pieces of legislation have passed. We already have a significant backlog, in the life of this new parliament, of legislation for the Senate to deal with. Little wonder, though, when we have seen the type of tactical games being played by those opposite—tactical games where they have split completely logical legislative packages so that bills may be considered separately. I refer in particular to the carbon tax abolition legislation, a package of 11 bills. The opposition took a tactical position here to split that so that all 11 bills would be debated separately—all 11 of them, never mind the fact that they are completely linked or that, when the Labor Party and the Greens were in government, they were quite happy to pass them as a package. They now, when we want to debate repealing them, come into this place and argue that we should consider them one after the other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What are the consequences of the Labor Party doing that? The consequence is that it will take an extraordinarily long period of time to be able to progress through the legislation. The consequence, for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (Abolition) Bill, was 10 hours and 46 minutes of this chamber's time was taken up on that one bill out of the 11 bills that constituted the government's package. Already, for the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) bill, four hours and six minutes of time in this chamber has been taken up and we are yet to get anywhere near a vote on the matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition continues to have pretty much every single member speak, and certainly on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (Abolition) Bill we saw some 27 Labor speakers come into this place. Pretty much everybody from the opposition ranks spoke. If they continue to apply that tactic on every one of the 11 bills in the clean energy, carbon tax abolition package we will see more than 117 hours of debate to get through each of those bills. That would be more than four times the time it took to pass the bills. It could take more than four times as long, given the tactics being deployed by the Labor Party and the Greens, to consider repealing the bills than it took to pass the bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is especially notable is that Labor and the Greens are voting down these bills at the second reading stage and so they are not even passing into the committee debate stage where we might expect to have protracted debate and discussions. Although it took a long period of time for the carbon tax bills to pass, that was in part because we had a long committee stage as well as a long sequence of speeches in the second reading debate. But at that time we had extended hours and we had the bills considered as a group. Now we are being denied the opportunity to consider the bills as a group and being denied extended hours to be able to get on and deal with the matter. As I said, it is the right of every member of this place to vote how they see fit on an individual bill, but it should be their responsibility to facilitate the vote taking place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a government could not have been clearer about the position we were taking in relation to the carbon tax when we went into the election. We went into it clearly saying that we would repeal the carbon tax. We clearly said the repeal would be the first piece of legislation introduced into the parliament. We honoured our promise. We made sure the exposure draft legislation was out in the promised time frame. We made sure that it was the first bill introduced into the parliament, as promised. We made sure that it had quick passage through the House of Representatives to give proper time for the Senate to debate it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I give some minor credit to the Australian Greens, who at least said they would not play ball with the Labor Party's tactic of trying to bump the carbon tax repeal off to a never-ending committee cycle. The Greens at the time said, 'We are happy to have the vote.' If the Greens were happy to have the vote then, they should be happy to have the vote now. The way to facilitate having a vote now would be to support extended hours so we can work through the remainder of these bills for however long it takes to get on and have that vote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a government were very clear that we wanted to lift this impost off Australian business and Australian households and that we wanted it to be the first order of business. That is what we sought to do. That is what we are seeking to do through this chamber. It is irresponsible in the extreme of those opposite to talk endlessly, to pad out speakers lists, to pile on speaker after speaker with repetitive arguments but then to fail to even support having the extended hours that might eventually allow us to proceed to having a vote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the only way that Labor and the Greens have been conspiring to subvert normal Senate practice. We have seen an increasing sequence of referrals of legislation to references committees—a practice that is not one the coalition adopted back when we held a Senate majority. We did not seek to abuse the longstanding practice of the Senate that reference committees consider general references, while legislation committees consider, unsurprisingly, legislation. But the Labor Party and the Greens, because they want to make sure that they exercise the resources of the committee secretariats to get the majority reports that they want written, are insisting on sending legislation off to references committees, completely subverting the idea of having the dual committee structure, rendering the legislation committees useless to the process because they are being shut out of what should be their proper job in this chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal and National parties believe the Senate has a critically important role to play. We will respect the processes of this Senate. We have not come in here seeking to gag debate like the previous government used to do. We have not come in here seeking to apply the guillotine on umpteen occasions like the previous government used to do. All we are asking for in this place is to have the extra hours required to allow us to successfully pursue our agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our agenda is about lowering business costs in Australia, making the Australian economy more competitive and ensuring that we create jobs, wealth and opportunities to sustain Australia into the future. Whether it is in the sphere of environmental regulation, reducing taxes or another area of government activity, we are focused on that effort of creating the environment in Australia for investment and opportunity to grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it is pleasing to see in my own portfolio space on the environment increased levels of environmental approvals actually happening. Minister Hunt is taking the decisions necessary in his portfolio to give approvals to development applications, with strict conditions in place to protect the environment, and getting projects off the ground. This is in stark contrast to what was happening under Labor where we saw consecutive environment ministers build up a logjam of decisions that never got through and were never considered and a situation where businesses wanting to get ahead with development simply faced an impediment to being able to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased in terms of easing the regulatory burden on communities, businesses and farmers that the House of Representatives earlier today disallowed two listings under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, directly relevant to my portfolio responsibility. One of these listings related to the Macquarie Marshes in New South Wales and the other listing captured vast tracts of land the entire stretch of the River Murray from the Darling Junction to the sea in a completely unnecessary way. They were made by the previous government days before they went into caretaker mode. In a complete abuse of privilege, thousands of kilometres of riverfront land were captured by the previous government in environmental regulations that added no net benefit to environmental protection but certainly added the potential for increased costs to landowners, businesses and those communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the months since the election we have taken the time to talk to those communities and do the assessment that has demonstrated that there are already more than 500 listings—of individual species, of wetlands, of migratory birds—that already provide very strong protections for those stretches of the Murray River and for the Macquarie Marshes. Indeed, the advice that the previous government had when it chose to undertake those listings was crystal clear in saying that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which we are committed to implementing in full and on time, was the real mechanism to provide protection and recovery for those areas of the Murray-Darling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that is getting on with ensuring that investment and opportunity can happen in Australia and that we are open for business. We plead with the other members of the Senate to allow us to get on and do the job, have the votes and make the decisions this chamber should make, and to facilitate that by allowing us to sit as long as is necessary to do so.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="5K4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAULKNER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  With the death of Nelson Mandela, South Africa has lost its father and the world has lost a leader of immense moral authority. Over more than a quarter of a century of imprisonment he became the living symbol of the fight for racial equality. Over decades of negotiation and statesmanship he became the moral conscience of his nation and the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nelson Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo. At school he was given the name Nelson, after Lord Horatio Nelson, a fitting moniker for an individual who spent his life resisting despite overwhelming odds. In 1941, he moved to Johannesburg, where he met lifelong comrade Walter Sisulu. There he saw that racism was a virus against which many white South Africans remained immune. In 1942, Nelson Mandela joined the African National Congress, the ANC. In 1943, he participated in the Alexandra bus boycott, an event that marked his transition from an aloof political observer to a leader fully engaged in the fight for racial equality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mandela's personal transition coincided with the political transformation underway in South Africa as Dr Malan's National Party swept to power in 1948—with it came apartheid. Apartheid was an incremental evil, a creeping menace that evolved from a series of changes in South Africa's legal and institutional architecture. It divided the nation along racial lines, denying nonwhites the right to determine where they could work and live, whom they could marry and the services they had access to. Apartheid enshrined in legislation a culture of racial superiority, entrenched the power of the Afrikaaner elite and disenfranchised the vast majority of South Africa's population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Faced with a racist and increasingly militant state Mandela became frustrated with what he saw as the genteel politics of the ANC's old guard. And so, in 1952, he helped orchestrate the national defiance campaign, a series of strikes and protests against apartheid, supported by the South African Indian Congress. Over 8,000 volunteered for the campaign. Risking arrest, they burnt their passes, contravened curfews and occupied segregated areas. The campaign radicalised and popularised the ANC—its membership swelled to 100,000 members. The government now faced a mass movement, directed by Nelson Mandela. The defiance campaign brought Mandela to prominence and with this notoriety came the attention of the state. In 1952, Mandela was arrested and placed on a banning notice that confined him to Johannesburg.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Undeterred, Mandela's activism continued. In 1955, he helped organise the Congress of the People, where the ANC, along with the union movement, the Indian Congress and the Coloured People's Congress, adopted the Freedom Charter—to this day an important statement of the inalienable humanity of all South Africans. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Faced with an increasingly violent and intrusive police state Mandela went underground. Harried and homeless, he helped organise the fight against apartheid from a series of safe houses. Faced with the reality that passive resistance would be met with bloody brutality, Mandela helped establish the military wing of the ANC—Umkhonto we Sizwe, the Spear of the Nation. This was done without alacrity or enthusiasm for violence but because past measures would not serve present circumstances. The pressure the Spear of the Nation applied to the nationalist government—exact and existential—was an effective means of forcing the apartheid regime to the negotiating table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1962, Mandela went abroad to garner support for the ANC's cause. In August that year Mandela returned to South Africa. For a time he evaded the authorities, but he was eventually captured and charged. In November 1962 he was sentenced to prison, and so began more than a quarter of a century of detention. Along with many dissidents of his generation he was incarcerated on Robben Island where the apartheid regime hoped that Mandela and his cause would fade from view. Mandela would remain out of sight, but not out of mind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than it destroying his spirit and banishing his message, on Robben Island Mandela grew—personally and politically. He faced brutality with calm rationality, developing the ability to separate his initial emotions from his ultimate goals. Mandela and his cause were amplified in his absence, maintained in the world's collective memory by the courageous activism of those still inside South Africa like Helen Suzman and Steve Biko, and by pressure from abroad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1976, the international community responded to the atrocities of Soweto by passing Resolution 134 in the United Nations Security Council. Economic, sporting and political sanctions followed. Australia, of course, played its part, beginning with Gough Whitlam, whose government supported non-racial voting in the UN General Assembly and banned South African sporting teams from touring Australia—moves that were supported by Malcolm Fraser, despite strong opposition within his own cabinet. The labour movement enforced sanctions and bans—actions that remind us of the crucial role unions can play in civil society. Prime Minister Bob Hawke galvanized the Commonwealth to fight apartheid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Faced with crippling economic sanctions and humiliating sporting prohibitions, the apartheid regime buckled. Mandela was finally released on 2 March 1990. It was a triumphant moment. The sight of an austere but jubilant Mandela walking from the prison gates is one of the most enduring images of the 20th century. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One can be forgiven for thinking Mandela's greatness emanates solely from his prison life and presidency. But this ignores the years of negotiation after his release where he and FW de Clerk created a new country, governed by a political system in which all South Africans, irrespective of colour or creed, had a stake in its future. The Codesa conferences of 1991 and 1992 showed that he and de Clerk were willing to put the national interest ahead of personal animosity. Chris Hani's murder and Mandela's appeal for calm from the very depths of his being reassured those who still questioned his ability to govern in the interests of all South Africans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 9 May 1994 Mandela was elected President, winning more than 66 per cent of the vote in South Africa's first free and fair elections. As President, Mandela presided over the nation's healing through the Truth and Reconciliation Process. But in 1999, despite the pleas of his nation and party, Mandela stepped down after a single term. As a statesman, he remained a champion of justice and freedom—courageous enough to challenge his party on the issue of AIDS, brave enough to voice his opposition to the Iraq war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hindsight is a luxury that provides certainty and finality to events that in reality are at best tenuous and troubling. Considering the past from the vantage point of the present, it is easy to think that Mandela's triumph was an inevitable extension of history's drive toward justice; a logical end point to the arc of history. This is a comfortable view, but one that strips Mandela and his movement of its moral force and sacrifice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At his trial in 1964, Nelson Mandela rose to give his greatest speech. In the dock, facing death, Mandela declared:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The whole of my life ... I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve.

His gift was that he understood himself intimately; his genius, that he understood the human condition with equal familiarity—its beauty and brutality, its insecurity and arrogance, its hatreds and hopes. And despite his years of confinement and the centuries of injustice meted out to his people, Mandela still believed in people's capacity to see in others a shared common humanity.</span>

But I think it is very important to remember that this government, compared to the previous government, has a plan for the future of this nation: delivering a safer, stronger Australia. Now, we actually have a plan, unlike the previous government, to ensure that we have sustainability across our portfolios into the future—unlike the previous government—and we will be making the appropriate decisions accordingly.</span>

It is important that the carbon tax be repealed as soon as possible. The carbon tax was the crux of the unholy job-destroying agreement between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens after the 2010 election. On 7 September 2013, Australians passed their judgement on both the carbon tax and the Labor-Greens alliance. </span>

Both were lies. Labor are now being given the opportunity to actually honour their word and to abolish what is the world's biggest carbon tax. If the coalition has a mandate for anything, it has a mandate to abolish the job-destroying carbon tax. But Labor will not follow through on their word with the necessary action in this place—namely, to repeal the iniquitous carbon tax.</span>

Labor lost government and the Greens lost a third of their vote nationally. The elected government says Labor should get out of its way and let the people have their say. We will give households a $550-a-year Christmas present, a present which will preserve their jobs and their household budgets, and help Australian business and industry.</span>

The Australian government believes that in a resource constrained environment the legal aid dollar should be spent where it is most needed. In particular we believe that funding should be focused on front-line legal aid services. One of the misgivings that we had about the approach of the former Labor government was that so much of the legal aid dollar was spent not on front-line legal services but on policy and advocacy work, which, while it may have been worthwhile in itself, meant that there were resources devoted to expenditure other than expenditure on casework.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of the legacy of debt which we have inherited from the previous government, an unprecedented legacy of debt, economies have to be found. Those economies will have to be found right across government. But, in making those economies within the Attorney-General's portfolio, my concern is to ensure that the legal aid dollar is focused on where it is most needed—that is, on front-line legal services. That applies in relation to Indigenous legal aid services as to all other legal aid services.</span>

Last night Minister Hunt approved the world's largest coal port, at Abbot Point, in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area, as well as another coal-seam-gas liquefication plant at Gladstone Harbour, also in the World Heritage Great Barrier Reef. These approvals for more coal and gas exports to worsen global climate change came on the same day that the government tried to repeal our climate laws.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbot Point approval allows dredging of three million cubic metres and offshore dumping of that sludge. The minister says the dredgers will have to offset that by saving 4½ million cubic metres of sediment from running off land to the reef, yet under the reef rescue program, with the full resources of the Commonwealth and Queensland and the hard work of farmers, in five years only one-twentieth of the amount of sludge that is planned to be dumped offshore from Abbot Point was stopped from entering the reef. How is it even possible that the dredgers will be able to save 20 times that amount? Who will enforce these conditions when the government wants to put Campbell Newman in charge of the reef and when you have sacked half the environment workers?</span>

Let me say at the outset that the government is unapologetic about our commitment to building a stronger economy to create more jobs, to create opportunities for people right across Australia and to do so in a way that is environmentally sustainable. This is of course why, after a rigorous assessment, two projects have indeed been approved by the Minister for the Environment at the port of Abbot Point: the Abbot Point coal terminal 0 project and the Abbot Point capital dredging project. It is important to note here that the port of Abbot Point is an existing, well-established coal port in the Great Barrier Reef. Some of the strictest conditions in Australian history—</span>

                  </a>  As I was saying: some of the strictest conditions in Australian history have been placed on these projects to ensure that any impacts are avoided, mitigated or offset. That is because the coalition government is committed to the long-term protection of the Great Barrier Reef as one of Australia's greatest natural assets. Ninety-five conditions have been placed on the two projects. They reflect the commitment to deliver a net benefit to the outstanding universal value of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, which includes a requirement to improve the water quality of the reef through a long-term net reduction of fine sediments entering the marine park from land based sources well beyond the life of the project. I add that the conditions, as Senator Waters said, require offset contributions estimated at around $32 million towards recovery actions for marine species and the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. The decisions have been made in line with the UNESCO World Heritage Committee's recommendations on port developments, in particular that no port developments or associated port infrastructure be permitted outside the existing and long-established major port areas within or adjoining the property. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Given that the World Heritage Committee has warned that the reef is headed for a downgrade in its status to World Heritage in Danger if this industrialisation of the reef continues and given that 63,000 people rely on a health reef for their livelihood, will the minister take personal responsibility for the collapse of tourism jobs that will follow a World Heritage in Danger listing?</span>

I clearly pointed out that our approval and the conditions that go with the approval actually contribute to an improvement of water conditions in that area. We are actually making things better than they were before by making sensible decisions where we balance opportunities for economic growth with improvement in environmental sustainability. That is something the coalition is committed to. That is something the Greens will never understand. I am hopeful that the Labor Party can understand this.</span>

Today the government moved to reduce protection for the Murray-Darling, and on Friday the Prime Minister is hoping to palm off all national environmental approval responsibilities to the states.

The second thing I would say is that under the coalition we will grow our economy and do it in a way that improves our environment, unlike the Labor-Greens government. When you were in government, you progressed 33 decisions to advance port and dredging activities at Abbot Point. We cannot undo the decisions of the Labor-Greens government, but we can clean up the mess of the Labor-Greens government, which put at risk the Great Barrier Reef, which we are committed to protect, preserve and see improved moving forward.</span>

On this basis, household average electricity and gas bills will be around $200 and $70 respectively lower than they would otherwise be in 2014-15, assuming a carbon tax worth $25.40 per tonne.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr President. To Senator Faulkner: I am trying to be a friendly persuader. Removing the carbon tax will be a boost for business. Time after time, business leaders have met the government and told us how the carbon tax has damaged business. More than 440 pages will be removed from the statute book if we act before this parliament ends this year. Removing liabilities from 30 June 2014 will simplify the transition for business by avoiding the need to change compliance systems in the middle of the financial year.</span>

That was the projection in the modelling in the budget papers. On the modelling from those opposite, the negative impact of the carbon tax would have been an increase in inflation of 0.7 per cent in this year, reducing gross national income by 0.8 per cent, and after 10 years the level of real wages would be 1.1 per cent lower across the country. The carbon tax is a cost that is not imposed on overseas business competitors; it is a reverse tariff. We have seen just how much it is affecting businesses. Qantas's annual report showed the carbon tax drove up operating expenses by $106 million. It has inflated the cost of a car by $400 per car. It is not just big corporations. The tax is also affecting mum-and-dad businesses, who face higher costs—for example, increases in electricity prices and transport costs, which they have to absorb; they cannot pass them on.</span>

Not only has the carbon tax not worked in the manner those opposite perhaps may have intended; it has shifted Australia's emissions to other parts of the world, and this is worse for the environment. Let me give you an example. A tonne of alumina produced in Australia emits an average of 0.85 tonnes of CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span>, while in China the average carbon emissions from production of a tonne of alumina are 1.35 tonnes. I call on those opposite to stop defying the will of the people of Australia, side with the coalition and immediately scrap the carbon tax.</span>

This decision is regrettable, especially for all those people that are gainfully employed by General Motors. They will be facing a bleak Christmas; there is no doubt about that.

As we all know, this announcement has just been made. As a responsible government, we will be talking with the company, with the unions and with all other interested stakeholders to ensure that we can assist them in their transition from employment with GM into other employment opportunities. Job Services Australia and other facilities and organisations will clearly be made available. But as for what is actually needed, we will determine in due course. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Australian people said so. PricewaterhouseCoopers tells us that that is the case. We would invite those opposite to actually take stock and see the consequences of what six years of Labor have done to many of our major employers. I would invite the Labor Party to join with us to help restore and reboot the Australian economy by supporting our reduction in company tax, by getting rid of the mining tax and the carbon tax, helping us to get rid of red tape and bringing the budget back into the situation it ought be in by voting for the same savings you actually promised before the election.</span>

It is indeed a fact that the former Labor government promised on more than 500 occasions that 2012-13 was going to be the surplus year. But, as always happens under Labor, they kept promising surplus budgets and they kept delivering more deficits. None other than Senator Wong, after she became the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, less than a month into the job, said to the Australian Institute of Company Directors, 'The return to surplus is not negotiable.' The following year she said that we are 'on track'. She promised that the three out-years from 2012-13 onwards would all be in the black with surpluses growing each year. Just this time last year on the ABC <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>program, Senator Wong—the then Minister for Finance and Deregulation—said, 'Our position has never changed.' She said the budget update was 'on track' to return to surplus and, 'Over the forward estimates those surpluses continue to grow.'</span>

The reason for this deterioration is that Labor spends too much in government. There was too much waste and too much mismanagement. If you look at our last period in government, we paid off Labor's debt, we delivered surplus budget after surplus budget, we cut taxes, the economy grew more strongly and we created more jobs. And what happened after six years of Labor? Of course we only have here the report card of five years of Labor, but, in that time, debt ramped up, we had record deficits, we had 43 new or increased taxes, economic growth slowed and unemployment went up. Turning this around is going to be a significant challenge for this government, but it is a challenge that we are committed to meet. Once the Australian people are able to see next week the true state of the budget that we have inherited from the Labor Party, we will repair the budget mess that we have inherited from the Labor Party.</span>

In recent months, the number of asylum seekers denied access to Medicare, work rights and financial support has increased significantly. Reports indicate that the waiting time to be considered by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection for financial support alone has increased from a few weeks to over 3 months. One organisation has indicated to me that, in the past month, every referral they have made for community assistance support has been rejected. Can the minister outline why highly vulnerable asylum seekers living in the community are all of a sudden being rejected from community assistance support when in previous months this was not the case?</span>

I advise the Senate that I am aware that there was an article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> newspaper today making certain allegations in relation to the CAS and ASAS payments, and I advise that the article is factually incorrect.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to Senator Madigan's questions, I advise as follows. As at 31 October 2013, 24,346 asylum seekers were supported under the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme, otherwise known ASAS. As at 31 October 2013, the average processing time of the ASAS applications was 22 working days, not over three months as has been alleged. The approval rate is over 90 per cent. The eligibility criteria for both ASAS and CAS have remained unchanged since the change of government. The government continues to provide asylum seekers living in the community on bridging visas with appropriate care and support through the ASAS system and the CAS program.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the benefit of the Senate, I advise that this support includes up to 6 weeks intensive transitional support, including provided accommodation upon release from immigration detention. Both CAS and ASAS provide income support and rent assistance at 89 per cent of the equivalent special benefit rate. Eligible asylum seekers can also access rent in advance, bond loans and cultural and community orientation.</span>

Is the minister aware the decision was made yesterday afternoon, after the Acting Prime Minister's letter and after seven days of senior ministers abusing General Motors in background briefings? Can we now confirm that this government's reckless behaviour demonstrates that the Prime Minister's commitment to Australian jobs is an empty promise, like other empty promises he has made to the Australian people before the election?</span>

One wonders where Senator Carr parked his crocodile after that display of crocodile tears! Can I say to the Senate, Peter Hodgman announced that he was going to run for the seat of Huon yesterday in the state of Tasmania. Lots of things happened yesterday that bear absolutely no relationship to GM's announcement today. This is trying a matter of trying to say that two types of activities are interlinked. They might be coincidental; they are not causal. They are coincidental and not causal, and that is something that Senator Carr and those opposite need to understand and reflect upon. The reality is this is a devastating blow to thousands of Australian workers.</span>

On 7 September the public of Australia cast their vote, and they cast their vote in favour of the coalition's policies. We committed to the Australian people that we, unlike the former government, would implement policies that would break the people smugglers' business model, which the other side had continually fuelled whilst it was in government.</span>

We on this side understand that. Those on that side failed to understand that whilst in government. The Australian people, in casting their vote at the federal election in September 2013, clearly cast a vote in favour of the coalition's policies. It is only by delivering on our strong border protection policies that we will stop the chaos, the tragedy and the bill, of in excess of $11 billion of taxpayers' money, that was irresponsibly racked up by those on the other side because they failed Australians when it comes to protecting Australia's borders. To relinquish control of your migration program to the people smugglers is one of the most fundamental mistakes a government can make. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I refer to my question last week regarding the number of individuals currently in detention centres and the documents she tabled in response, dated 31 October 2013. Why is the minister so contemptuous of requests by the Senate that she is tabling documents that have been in the public arena for over a month rather than addressing the substance of the question that was actually asked in question time?</span>

The longest period of time being five continuous months in which the department did not put up on any website the statistics, I asked at estimates time and time again for them. What was the responses that I got? 'The department is currently not putting up the statistics.'

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) to questions without notice asked by Senators Wong and Carr today relating to the announcement by GM Holden of its decision to cease its manufacture of cars in Australia by 2017.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is a sad day. It is a sad day for workers employed by General Motors Holden. It is a sad day for their families and for the communities in which they live. It is a sad day for suppliers, including component manufacturers, and it is a particularly sad day for my home state of South Australia and the state of Victoria where these operations exist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say something today, in this taking note of answers, about the way in which this government has approached these serious issues—which was exemplified again today by the contempt with which the Leader of the Government in the Senate treated serious questions about the plight of workers and their families and the importance of supporting workers and their families. The reality is that in their short time in office this government has spent most of its recent time working to drive Holden out of Australia and championing closure. Well, they have got what they were working for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us go through the facts. Before the election and after, this government said, 'We will take $500 million out of the co-investment for the auto industry that the previous government had put on the table.' This was assistance that was about leveraging investment and jobs here in Australia, with returns not only to workers but also to our economy because of the importance of the manufacturing skills that the car industry contains. What did they promise after that half a billion dollars of cuts? Uncertainty. They said to a company that is competing in a global market that they were going to take half a billion dollars off the table for the industry and were not guaranteeing anything after 2015. That is the uncertainty they placed on General Motors Holden. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What they did afterwards was say, 'We are going to have a Productivity Commission review. We will have an interim report before Christmas and a final report next year.' In fact, Mr Macfarlane is on the public record as asking Holden to defer any decision as to whether or not it would continue operations until after the Productivity Commission had reported. That was the government's position. Then, all of a sudden, prodded into action because of the Treasurer's folding to the National Party on GrainCorp, the economic drys in the cabinet and the ministry decided that it was a good idea to try and start pushing Holden to make a decision before Christmas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what did they do? I have never seen a government have senior economic ministers backgrounding against a company, day after day, in the way that we have had the misfortune to observe in this last week. Who would have thought that we would see coalition senior ministers backgrounding the media and essentially championing the closure of General Motors Holden. But that is what we have seen from this government—a week of leaking and a week of putting pressure on Holden to make a decision. I again remind the chamber that this was all in the context of them having said to Holden, 'Don't make a decision until after the PC review.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of a sudden, they decided it was in their political interests to try and force Holden to a decision before the PC review. They started with backgrounding last week, and it broke on the ABC, was reported widely in the prints and clearly continued. Senator Abetz keeps saying, 'I am not going to respond. You don't believe everything that is written in the papers.' Well, I do not believe that journalists who are reputable would be making things up about coalition senior ministers backgrounding about the closure of Holden. We then had the Acting Prime Minister writing to the company to demand that they tell people whether or not they have made a decision to close. So on the one hand you have said to defer a decision, and then on the other you champion the closure and put pressure on them. I hope you are happy now, because they have made a decision. The contempt with which this government appears to hold this company and these workers was demonstrated today when I asked a serious question of the man who is supposed to be the Leader of the Government in the Senate—and what does he play politics with? The carbon tax.</span>

                  <a href="e4t" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  Senator Wong, if we are going to talk about a disgrace, the disgrace is your former government, the Labor government, and the disgrace of the mess that they left this government and the disgrace that we in this government now have to face it. Interestingly enough, we had two or three questions on the car industry and then it was dropped to go on to the other great strength of those opposite, border protection. Senator Kim Carr, can I remind you that when you were the minister one job was lost in the car industry every 19 minutes—that is, three jobs every hour that you were the minister and 72 jobs a day when you were the minister. So don't you come into this place and tell us. You are the hypocrite, Senator Carr, when you come into this place and now try to blame the coalition for a decision that was six years in the making. Don't you come into this place and tell us that story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, of course, today's announcement that Holden is closing down is a very disappointing one. Holden is an iconic Australian company. It has a very rich Australian history. This decision is disappointing not just for its workers and its suppliers but for all Australians. I remind the Senate that the government was working in a measured and methodical way to assist Holden with their significant challenges as they were adjusting to the high value of the Australian dollar and a highly competitive and fragmented market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has done its very best to support Holden and the automotive industry more generally in this difficult period. The government stands by its position that the Productivity Commission was the best placed body to independently assess all the information and details and to provide a final report by 31 March next year. It was the former Labor government that created the significant sovereign risk in relation to the car industry by continually flip-flopping and chopping and changing policy settings affecting the industry. Yes, it is very disappointing news today but this government has always and will always follow due process and, unlike those opposite, keep our commitments to the people of Australia. As the Treasurer said recently, the future of the car industry is in the hands of the car industry itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take you to the announcement that GM made today. I will quote it again just in case, former Minister Carr, you were not listening when Senator Abetz quoted it. So I am going to quote it to you again. It says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are completely dedicated to strengthening our global operations while meeting the needs of our customers … The decision to end manufacturing in Australia reflects the perfect storm of negative influences the automotive industry faces in the country, including the sustained strength of the Australian dollar, high cost of production—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I repeat that for you, 'high cost of production'—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">small domestic market and arguably the most competitive and fragmented auto market in the world.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what would those high costs of production be? Try the carbon tax, which Holden estimates is about $45 per locally made vehicle; the rates of company tax; the fringe benefits tax. Let us go back to Labor's record on cars. You have absolutely no plan whatsoever. You have no plan, you have no vision and you belted the car industry around. In the last two years, you broke $1.4 billion of your promised funding commitments as you chopped and changed, and that is on top of the carbon tax, which slugged the sector with a further $460 million bill at the worst possible time. Julia Gillard promised $34 million for Ford, which she said would create 300 jobs—another broken promise. In eight months 330 jobs were gone. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KIM CARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:20</span>):  After the Acting Prime Minister's letter to General Motors of yesterday, there was a decision taken in Detroit. So the letter was received yesterday afternoon and a decision was taken in response to that letter, that reckless, cavalier correspondence from the Acting Prime Minister. While the Prime Minister is out of the country, the Acting Prime Minister manages to blow up General Motors Holden. Well, what an achievement is this dishonest and cowardly attack that has occurred on this company, replicated day after day after day by senior members of the coalition and demonstrated on the ABC last Thursday night whereby they said that they had already made a decision. Of course, their aim was to force a decision by General Motors before Christmas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know the truth of this matter. As the minister, I was able to be privy to a series of negotiations with General Motors about their situation in Australia and I know the opposition—that is, the coalition—was fully briefed on the situation at General Motors and they have known for some time what the actual situation has been with General Motors, given what the company's letter of today indicates. The increase in the value of the Australian dollar has increased the costs of production in Australia by as much as 65 per cent, as they have referred to in this letter. The company had said to the Labor government, 'We need to look at the arrangements which occur around the world and we need to look at the business case in Australia,' and this government was provided with the same information when they came into office. As for the government, at the Elizabeth plant in Adelaide, Minister Macfarlane said he wanted the company to defer any decision until such time as the Productivity Commission had reported. But yesterday the Acting Prime Minister wrote a letter to General Motors and demanded an immediate answer. And of course they have now got their immediate answer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have got their immediate answer, and the actions in the House of Representatives yesterday—following, as I say, seven days of abuse of this company by senior members—meant that the industry insider said that the company felt 'bullied and hectored'. What a hell of a way to run a foreign investment strategy in this country, to bully and hector a major manufacturing company—probably the biggest manufacturing company in Australia; probably the most important company in Australia because it stands at the centre of ensuring the terms of our industrial R&amp;D in this country. It is a company which has, in fact, contributed, according to its advice, in return for $1.8 billion in Commonwealth assistance, $1.4 billion in tax revenue, and it has paid $21 billion to other businesses over the past 10 years. It is a company that has made a huge contribution to this country. The situation now is we have a government which has sought, because of its ideological obsessions, to destroy this company's manufacturing capabilities in this country. We have a situation in which General Motors notes, in the statement that was issued at two o'clock today:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

You have pursued a vendetta against this company, and you have now got what you have asked for. You established a Productivity Commission inquiry—I have said for some time I was very, very concerned that what you were actually doing was establishing a coroner's inquiry, a post-mortem process. The only difference here is the coroner was actually pleased about the death. That is the situation with this government. They have been seeking this result. They have been pursuing a campaign against manufacturing in this country, particularly automotive manufacturing. They have campaigned against the international automotive industry; they have been playing chicken with this company, and we now have the result. The consequences are going to be a social and economic catastrophe for this country, and you, Minister, and your government are directly responsible.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BERNARDI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  I follow Senator Carr's hysterical and rather incoherent rant, and share with Senator Wong, quite frankly, that this is a very sad day. As a South Australian, it is a sad day to see 1,600 jobs at the Holden car plant disappear by 2017, and to see the flow-on effects that will no doubt impact on the South Australian economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I have to say we were warned about this some time ago. Seven years ago in this place I stood up and I said that if Mr Kim Carr ever became industry minister, there would be no car industry in this country. And what followed was the full Chairman Mao outburst and rhetoric and 20 minutes of abuse about how I did not know what I was talking about. But Senator Carr himself has overseen for the past six years the closure of Mitsubishi and the announcement that Ford is going, and the legacy of his mismanagement, and the Labor Party's mismanagement, of the manufacturing industry in this country is the announcement by Holden today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tragedy of Senator Carr is that he suffers from veritaphobia. Veritaphobia is a fear of telling the truth, and this is what we have got on that side of the chamber. He will not acknowledge that his motivation and his interest in the motor vehicle industry were driven more by his factional powerbroking and his attempt to stifle the short cons in Victoria and by his desire to boost his faction ranks by unionising the workforce, giving them whatever they wanted to amass more union muscle for him. That was his interest. He was not interested in sustaining the industry as a whole; he was more interested in sustaining his union base. That is the power—the misuse and abuse of power—that we see from the other side of the chamber.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an opposition that is absolutely flawed, and it is so embarrassed by its own track record it is trying to blame others for its mismanagement. I have to say that I thought Senator Carr, with his fear of the truth, his veritaphobia, actually let something slip; he blurted out something during his question today. In one of the questions he asked he said the exit of Holden was 'tragic and unavoidable'. A true word is often spoken by a slip of the tongue, because Senator Carr presided over and saw all the inside nitty-gritty about the industry when he was industry minister and he put it in the too-hard basket. He said: 'No, I don't want to deal with this. I've borrowed $300 million on behalf of the Australian people, but I don't want to save their manufacturing industry.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sick of the hypocrisy on the other side. We inherited a basket case of a budget. There is no doubt about that. We were elected to fix up the mess that Labor created; the legacy of Labor's six years, their torrent of abuse of office, is going to be with us for some time yet. Holden, unfortunately, is a casualty of that. There are 1,600 jobs going in my state of South Australia, and the flow-on effects are going to be felt for years and years to come. But the blame, fairly and squarely, lies with poor government management by the Labor Party over the last six years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Carr would have the people of Australia believe that somehow General Motors in Detroit last night just said: 'Let's shut down our South Australian and Victorian manufacturing facilities. Let's do that at a cost of some $600 million.' Unfortunately, we know the Labor Party is cavalier about $600 million, $1 billion and $100 billion, but General Motors are not. They would have been looking at and examining for many years the consequences and the potential costs. We know there are unavoidable issues attached to manufacturing in this country—the high dollar, the tyranny of distance, the relatively small market and so on—but Senator Carr and his cohorts in the Labor Party need to come clean and start telling the truth. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

On 7 September, Mr Abbott said to the Australian people, 'Australia is open for business.' Tell that to the thousands of Holden workers who today found out that their company is going to close in this country. Tell that to the extra thousands of suppliers who are going to lose supply contracts. This is not just about South Australia and Victoria, where of course these factories are located.

Given what we know about the circumstances and what we know about the urgency of the issue, why didn't he ring Mr Devereux? He had just left the Productivity Commission hearing. Why didn't he get on to him and say, 'What do we need to do urgently to save this company?'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the minister was not able, or perhaps not willing, to answer the substance of my questions. The first part of my questions went to how on earth a dredging company could be given approval to dredge and dump three million cubic metres of sludge into a World Heritage area—and not just any World Heritage area but the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area. The Great Barrier Reef is the largest living organism that can be seen from space, is one of the seven natural wonders of the world and is in my beautiful home state of Queensland. How on earth did the Minister for the Environment tick off on the world's largest coal port and all of that dredging and dumping? My first question to the minister was: how do you think they could possibly offset that damage by working with landholders to try to reduce the sediment flowing into the reef when in five years, with the full might of the Commonwealth, the Queensland government and those very hardworking farmers, we have been able to save only one-twentieth of the amount that the dredging company is now allowed to dump on the reef? It is a magic pudding condition that is not even possible to be complied with even if there were the will to try.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, sadly, that in Queensland the Newman government has cut 220 workers from its Department of Environment and Heritage Protection—those same people who would check on whether conditions are going to be complied with. They would monitor that and possibly take court action if conditions were being breached. And we know, sadly, that the federal Department of the Environment faces those same cuts and more coming down the line. Where are the people who are going to be checking these conditions? They have been sacked. These conditions will not be complied with and we will see massive water quality damage to the World Heritage area that is the Great Barrier Reef, right at the time when the World Heritage Committee has warned Australia that the reef could end up on that international list of shame, the List of World Heritage in Danger. That would be a huge blow to our tourism industry. We would be one of the few developed nations with a World Heritage site on that list, and that would massively damage the 63,000 jobs that rely on the reef being healthy and visitable by tourists. The minister gave some glib remarks about how the economy would save everything and completely ignored the fact that underpinning a healthy economy needs to be a healthy environment. Clearly basic biophysics has completely eluded the government, as has the notion of science itself, with its lack of a science minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I next raised the fact that the government on Monday in the House of Representatives moved to water down environment protections for threatened species across the board by allowing the Minister for the Environment to ignore expert advice about the threats to threatened species from things like dredging, dumping, mines and the like. I mentioned the approval not just of the world's biggest coal port, at Abbot Point, but also the coal seam gas liquefaction facility in Gladstone Harbour. I mentioned that, yesterday, this government also tried to repeal part of our climate laws—unsuccessfully, thank goodness. I mentioned that, today, the government in the House has sought to remove protection for endangered ecological communities in the Murray-Darling. And, of course, on Friday the Prime Minister wants to completely get rid of all his federal approval responsibilities and just leave that to state governments. This has been an atrocious week for Australia's environment, but it has been a week when we have absolutely seen the true colours of this government. So I asked the minister representing when Minister Hunt would be ordering his new door plaque, 'Minister against the Environment'. Sadly, I got yet another glib reply to that very serious question. Perhaps I will have one made and send it to the minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I come back to the fact that we have a World Heritage icon—perhaps the most globally famous and beautiful World Heritage icon—which brings in $6 billion a year to our economy, which employs 63,000 people and which does not need any more coal ports. We have 12 coal and other mixed export ports already in the Great Barrier Reef. They are not even being used to their full capacity. We have had several reports that show they are being used at about two-thirds capacity. So we have empty coal port capacity, and yet we have plans, with approvals last night, to expand coal ports, to do needless damage to the reef, to burn coal from the Galilee Basin. If all the coal in the Galilee Basin were a country, it would be the seventh-biggest emitter in the world. This is a disastrous government, and Australia's environment is finished under this administration.</span>

                    </a>  The government will not be supporting this motion. The government is, however, highly supportive of the role of TAFE within the vocational education and training sector. As background, in 2012 the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments agreed to a new national partnership agreement on schools reform, to transform the national training system. Under the national partnership, states and territories explicitly agreed to develop and implement strategies to enable public providers, including TAFE, to operate effectively in an environment of greater competition. This is one of the milestones which states and territories must achieve for payment under the national partnership. The minister has asked the department to consider issues facing the vocational education and training sector, including those raised during the previous inquiry into TAFE.</span>

                  </a>  The Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens have just voted together to seek to deny the will of the Australian people as expressed at the last election. There could not have been a clearer policy proposition by any party at the last election than the explicit and often repeated commitment by the coalition to abolish the carbon tax—which, as you know, Mr Deputy President, was introduced by the former government in direct breach of a solemn commitment given at an election. The plan of those opposite has been clear all week, and that has been to delay, delay, delay—to put speaker after speaker after speaker, repeating the same lines over and over again, to deny the opportunity to get all 11 bills to a vote. The Senate should sit until such time as the package of bills is dealt with. That is what this motion was for. I acknowledge Senator Xenophon sitting on the correct side of the chamber for this vote. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Earlier this week we accepted on this side that we would support the government's sitting pattern. When we indicated that support, we said that we would not be inclined to accept submissions for extra hours. Over the last fortnight there has been no urgency—no request until the last minute to come in here on the Wednesday and say, 'We want to have extra hours.' The government had adequate time to put in place times to meet their requirements. They did not. We did not return to this place until very late. We had a short period. The Senate is doing what it always does: it considers the business in front of us. Every senator has the right to make a contribution on legislation. That is what the Senate does. We will continue to consider legislation as it comes before us. We will do our job. That is the role of the Senate. If there was such urgency, there should have been some discussion earlier. There was not. We do not accept the proposition for extra hours. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a>  The opposition is proposing a wider reference to this same committee. That reference will look at the government's failure to fund public transport projects in favour of a focus on roads. It will look at the productivity benefits of an integrated approach across rail and road projects. It will also look at issues such as the impact on user charges for public transport arising from a refusal by the federal government to provide funding for public transport. The expanded inquiry will allow a focus on the East West project in Melbourne and the failure of the federal government to fund the Melbourne Metro Rail project, but it will go much further and take a national focus. On that basis we are opposing this proposition.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">After the deaths of 202 people, 88 of whom were Australians, in the Bali terrorist attacks of 2002, the then Howard Government introduced legislation to make it a crime to harm Australians overseas. The definition of harm includes murder, manslaughter, and intentionally or recklessly causing harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the time, the legislation to amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Code Act 1995</span> was made retrospective to cover occurrences dating from 1 October 2002. This covered the so-called ‘Bali Bombings’ but not cases prior to that date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have been approached by a family who have been directly impacted by the limited time period that applies to the provisions under Division 115 of the Act. Their family member was brutally murdered before the 1 October 2002 date, and the case has never been resolved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments in this bill remove the commencement date for these provisions, and therefore allow them to apply to any case before 1 October 2002 that meets the criteria under Division 115. The aim of this bill is to ensure all Australians can receive justice under these provisions, not just those who were affected after a certain date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Act itself already contains safeguards to prevent unmeritorious claims. Section 115.6 contains provisions relating to bringing proceedings under this division, and requires that proceedings must not commence without the written consent of the Attorney-General. This measure will ensure that only cases with evidence that would likely lead to a successful prosecution would be pursued.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, in response to concerns regarding the retrospectivity of criminal law, it is important to note that the original bill that established these provisions, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Code Amendment (O</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ffences Against Australians) Bill </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2002</span>, was in itself retrospective. The Bill itself was assented to on 14 November 2002, but the provisions came into effect from 1 October 2002. Presumably this was to ensure the Bali Bombings, which occurred on 12 October 2002, were covered by the provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As such, in response to criticisms of retrospectivity and changing the law to suit a particular case, the bill that established Division 115 in 2002 forms the precedent for the measures in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Equally, this bill deals with crimes of murder, manslaughter and causing serious harm, which already exist in all other jurisdictions. As such, this bill does not establish a crime retrospectively, but instead extends the capacity for involvement of Australian law enforcement that this Division already provides.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ultimately, this question is one of support for Australian families who have lost loved ones overseas or who have suffered serious injury as a result of a criminal act. It provides a further avenue for investigation when local authorities do not have the ability or will to pursue a case, and provides an avenue of justice where there would otherwise be no resolution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />It makes no sense to limit a person’s access to justice when the crimes concerned include murder and manslaughter. These are rightly considered inexcusable acts, and the right to seek justice in these cases should not be limited. As Martin Luther King said: “<span style="font-style:italic;">Law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> and when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress.</span><span style="font-style:italic;">”</span></span>

                  </a>  I cannot let a statement like that go past. It is entirely provocative to see the kind of behaviour that has been engaged in by coalition backbenchers all the way through to the communications minister and the Prime Minister attempting to bully, intimidate, judge and second-guess the national broadcaster. In February and March when a number of relatively modest media reform proposals came before this chamber by the Labor Party, some of which were supported by the Greens, the people who shrieked the most, who were the most strident about independence and a free press are now the ones who are trying to gag the ABC. How inappropriate for the Prime Minister and the communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to be carpeting ABC director Mark Scott and second-guessing editorial decisions. It is absolutely inappropriate. I cannot believe coalition members would be voting against a motion that does nothing more or less than defend the editorial independence and the funding basis of our treasured national broadcaster. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It has clear, established and communicated protocols designed by the joint-agency taskforce led by Lieutenant General Campbell to support the effectiveness of the operation. These procedures ensure that people smugglers do not use official information to sell and promote their product and to create false perceptions amongst potential illegal entrants to Australia. Information regarding the incident to which the motion refers has been released in the form of two media releases from the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection on 5 December, in addition to comments by both the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Lieutenant General Campbell in the Operation Sovereign Borders briefing on Friday, 6 December. I refer the senator to those statements and transcripts.</span>

                  </a>  There are two parts to this motion. The first part relates to whaling; the second part relates to illegal fishing in the Southern Ocean. The exact wording for both sections came directly from the coalition's policy. The part relating to whaling was taken word-for-word from Minister Hunt's website. The second section on illegal fishing and patrolling illegal fishing was taken from the coalition's election plan on fishing. I highlight the words:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem we have at the moment is that our custom-built boat for the Southern Ocean, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ocean Protector</span>, is off Christmas Island acting as an expensive water taxi. It is needed in the Southern Ocean and it should be off Macquarie Island. I expect the coalition to support today's motion given that these exact words are word-for-word from their policy documents.</span>

                  </a>  Australia's views on whaling are well known. The Australian government strongly opposes all commercial whaling, including Japan's so-called scientific whaling. We hope that the International Court of Justice makes a positive decision shortly and that there is no attempt at whaling. If, however, the fleet set sail, as it appears they may have started to, a commitment to monitoring and observing remains undiminished. Beyond that, we will obviously not pre-empt or discuss operational activities. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service is working with other government agencies on how it can best support the government's commitment in the Southern Ocean, including the deployment of a border protection asset for this purpose.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  I rise with great sadness to talk about the fate of the Great Barrier Reef after the so-called Minister for the Environment last night approved the world's biggest coal port at Abbot Point in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy President, you might think that coal ports do not really belong in a World Heritage area, and you would be right. But that did not stop their approval last night which, sadly, also included the fourth coal seam gas liquefaction plant on Curtis Island in Gladstone Harbour, which is now infamous for the terrible environmental destruction that it has faced following the biggest-ever dredging program in Gladstone Harbour that the reef had ever seen—of course, all for coal seam gas export. We know that coal seam gas is terrible news for our farmland and for our water, as well as for our reef, pockmarking our best food-producing land and contaminating and potentially reducing the groundwater levels of our aquifers in Queensland and right across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly, Mr Hunt's approval last night of these mega-fossil-fuel projects within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area came as a shock to many. I think the testament to that is information that Australians last night were calling the minister's office until about midnight, protesting against his decision. It is clear that people actually want the reef protected. They acknowledge that it is one of the seven natural wonders of the world, that it is the biggest living organism that can be seen from space and that it is a biodiversity icon that the world has charged us with protecting. We should be proud of that and do everything we can to protect it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased when Australians last night told the Minister for the Environment that they do not want the reef sacrificed for the private profits of overseas mining companies—because that is who will benefit from these approval decisions. There will be spurious job claims made, as they often are and, naturally, they will not stack up in the numbers promised. That is just how it goes, sadly. But what we will see in terms of jobs is a real threat to the 63,000 people who need a healthy Great Barrier Reef for their jobs and for their livelihoods—be they fisher folk, tourism operators or small business folk up and down the coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is a crime to prioritise the private profits of offshore mining companies ahead of the beauty of the reef and ahead of those 63,000 Australians who need that reef for their livelihoods and for their families' livelihoods. For all of the talk we hear about the economy and jobs, we have seen the true colours of this government—the Abbott government—that actually they care more about big mining companies than they do about Australian jobs, let alone the environment. Sadly, the latter was no news to anyone; but perhaps the former does come as news to people who might have thought about supporting the Abbott government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Hunt has been on the airwaves today trying to justify his decision. In fact, I thought it was quite amusing to hear Senator Cormann say that this world's biggest coal port is going to be good news for the reef, because it is going to fix water quality! I all but laughed. One of the conditions that Minister Hunt has imposed would require the dredging company to save 4½ million tonnes of sediment from entering the reef catchment. That is a noble aim, in fact an aim that has occupied the Commonwealth, the Queensland government and many hard-working Queensland farmers for the last five years, whereupon with all of that resourcing—200 million bucks—they have been able to save 200,000 cubic metres of sediment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So now, miraculously and magically, Minister Hunt thinks that the dredging company can do better than the Commonwealth, better than the Queensland government and better than those farmers are already doing and save 20 times that amount of sediment just so it can have permission to dump that sludge offshore. It is not going to work; we all know it is not going to work. Sadly, we also know that nobody is going to be watching to make sure those conditions are complied with. I wish they were, but they have been sacked! The Campbell Newman government in Queensland has already sacked 220 workers from the environment department and we know that there have been unfortunate retrenchments already from the federal environment department, and we are expecting more under this government's pre-election promises and the Commission of Audit—headed of course by none other than the Business Council of Australia head, Tony Shepherd.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So where are those people who will actually enforce those conditions? They have lost their jobs, much like the tourism operators and the fishers on the reef who will lose their jobs when the reef gets put on the World Heritage endangered list because this government would rather see profits flow offshore to big mining companies than to actually act in the interests of the reef. It is a criminal shame. I have no confidence that the conditions can even be complied with, nor will anyone be paying any attention as to whether they are in terms of the regulators, because they have been sacked.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the World Heritage Committee come out and visit the reef the year before last and express extreme concern at the future of the reef. It warned the Australian government and the Queensland government about the effects of mass industrialisation of the reef. It gave the Australian government a very clear warning: if you do not stop this trajectory of destruction we will put the reef on that international list of shame—the list of World Heritage in danger—and downgrade its World Heritage status. Not many other developed countries—in fact, only one other—has a site on that list. That would be a huge blow to our tourism industry. We already know the employment figure, 63,000 people, and much of that is from tourism. People do not come to see World Heritage in danger. They do not come to see coal ports and they do not come to see coal ships. They do not come to see coral that has been smothered with sludge that has been dug up from World Heritage waters and dumped further out into World Heritage waters because it is cheaper for the big mining companies to do that than it is to treat that spoil and dispose of it safely on land. We know what a blow a World Heritage in danger listing would be to our tourism sector and we know it would recognise the peril that the reef is in. Why is this government courting that outcome? Why is it daring the UN to downgrade the reef's status to World Heritage in danger? That is what last night's approval really did. It was like a red carpet invitation to downgrade the reef's status—reckless in the extreme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, it has come off the back of a pretty tough week for Australia's environment. On Monday in the House of Representatives this government sought to weaken threatened species protection under those same environmental laws by saying that it was all right for the Minister for the Environment to ignore expert advice on threatened species and the effects a particular project might have on those species—it was okay to ignore expert advice because it is science and they don't really like science that much. They don't need a minister for science and it is kind of inconvenient when science tells you that you shouldn't do the things you want to do, so let's just ignore it! They sought to change the law to allow the environment minister to ignore expert conservation advice. It passed the House of Representatives. I hope it does not pass the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They did not stop there. I have already spoken of last night's coal port and CSG liquefaction plant approvals, but also yesterday this government sought to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, that wonderfully successful renewable energy bank that is not only reducing greenhouse gas emissions but making money for the taxpayer. This is a profitable investment. They are making a profit. Why on earth, when we are in such a confected budget crisis, would you want to slash a body that is actually making money as well as saving the climate? I do not understand the rationale, but I suspect logic simply does not come into it with this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was yesterday. Today they are moving to abolish protection for the Murray-Darling. The listing of those endangered ecological communities earlier this year has now been disallowed by the House. They do not actually want to protect the wetlands and the Macquarie Marshes that feed and sustain the Murray-Darling Basin. And this Friday, at the Council of Australian Governments meeting, the COAG meeting, the Prime Minister is seeking to sign up yet more states to take over Greg Hunt's job. Minister Greg Hunt does not want his job anymore. He has decided he cannot be bothered giving approvals to big mines anymore. He is happy to let Campbell Newman do that and Barry O'Farrell do that. This plan unwinds the 30 years of history where the Commonwealth has been able to step in and protect icons and species places that are nationally significant. The Prime Minister wants to get rid of that on Friday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been an atrocious week for the environment. It has been a terribly sad week for the Great Barrier Reef and for all of those who love it. We know that it is not just Australians who love our reef. It is hugely popular with international tourists and, in fact, it is sacred in the hearts of many people across the world. We can and should be doing so much better. I will be reintroducing a bill in this place shortly to adopt those World Heritage Committee recommendations to save our reef. It is not that hard. We just have to start putting the reef and the people who rely on it ahead of the interests of the big mining companies. We can do that. It is not that hard. Will this government do it? They have not yet and I remain hopeful, for the sake of those 63,000 Queenslanders and for everyone who loves the reef, that they will soon change their tune.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BOSWELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  Senator Waters raises her concerns about the Great Barrier Reef. I share her concerns about the Barrier Reef, but under no circumstances do I believe the reef is under threat. Last night the Minister for the Environment put forward plans so that some mining and natural gas facilities could go ahead. They were put forward under the most stringent conditions, where there is going to have to be a net benefit for water quality, $89 million will be contributed to support the health of the Barrier Reef through programs such as Reef Trust and there are 95 environmental conditions at Abbot Point and 53 at Curtis Island.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with Senator Waters is that she lives with rose-tinted glasses. She does not recognise that jobs are created. We have just faced one of the most difficult situations in Australia, with the biggest icon in Australia announcing its closure today, affecting many thousands of jobs and the jobs hanging off it. I do not want to debate the rights and wrongs, who said what and who did this. The main point of my argument is that those jobs have to be replaced somewhere or people will not have the standard of living that they have been able to afford over the last 20 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Arrow liquefied natural gas plant proposal is owned by Shell and PetroChina, it is going to cost $17.46 billion and there will be 3,715 construction jobs and 600 operational jobs. That is vast. That is so many jobs created. When we turn to the Adani project, we are looking at thousands more jobs that are going to open up in Bowen. Senator Waters says there are many people who have been opposing it and ringing up the minister's office complaining about the decision. Well, I can tell Senator Waters that the town of Bowen is absolutely rejoicing. They have had many failures in Bowen. When the abattoirs went, 1,500 jobs went. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, I understand that the town's resident Green is complaining, while her husband and son work at Abbot Point.</span>

                  </a>  What I said is factually true, as I understand it and as it has been related to me. There is a person in Bowen spruiking the Green agenda who, as explained to me, is a resident Green in Bowen, while her husband and son work at Abbot Point. I am not saying that there is anything wrong. I am not casting any aspersions against anyone. I am merely making a statement that has been related to me by residents of Bowen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The $10 billion that GVK and Adani are going to proceed with is a railway line. Already they have said that they will put their facilities in Bowen and the people in Bowen are rejoicing about this. So not everyone, Senator Waters, is ringing the minister complaining. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last 12 months the town of Bowen has taken major hits with local businesses closing. The Bank of Queensland has shut its doors, two legal offices and three restaurants have closed, and newsagents have also shut their doors. In July, Bowen residents turned up in the town square to support the Abbot project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has happened of course is that the Labor Party dodged this. They would not make the decision. Tony Burke delayed the decision before the last election. Mark Butler also delayed the decision, and this has held up all these jobs that were going to be created. They were afraid of offending the Greens and the latte set in Melbourne and Sydney. But they do not stand up for the blue-collar workers that would get these jobs in Bowen and Collinsville and Abbot Point, and they are the people that the Labor Party are going to need to get them back into government. As long as they dodge the decisions and side with the Greens, then the blue-collar workers who have already made a decision are not going to support a government that cannot take a decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course these decisions are hard, and I congratulate Mr Hunt for making them. They are hard decisions and he is an environmentalist at heart, but he has made a decision that looks after both sections—the environment, putting on the most stringent conditions, and then recognising that Australia has to have jobs. There has never been a time in Australia's history that I can report, certainly in my time, when the need for creating jobs has been so predominant. As for these changed new conditions, they are not saying that the companies will put these growth-promoting jobs into the community, but that it is possible to do it. They have got to go through a lot further process. But the decision by Adani and by GVK is going to open up thousands of jobs—and I do not want to be accused of going over the top by saying hundreds of thousands of jobs, but certainly thousands of jobs. The Galilee Basin will be open and jobs will flow into the little towns of Jericho and places out there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You cannot have wealth in this nation without earnings. Senator Waters believes in the Magic Pudding—you can have everything. I am sorry, Senator Waters, the world is not like that. Your party has, at every opportunity, attacked the coal-mining industry and this, I believe, is another attack. In March 2012 a document called <span style="font-style:italic;">Stopping the coal export boom: funding proposal for the Australian anti-coal mining movemen</span>t became public. It was a prospectus for large-scale funding to shut down the Australian coal industry. The preparation of the document was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation in the USA and endorsed by Greenpeace and a number of national environmental activists. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is exactly what you are doing today, and then you are claiming that this has great support. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do acknowledge that it has some problems attached to it in professional fishing and amateur fishing. I do believe that there will need to be some offsets for those people. Maybe boat ramps and fishing tables and cleaning tables will have to be offered, and, if significant fishing grounds are going to be lost, then I think there will have to be offsets. Fishermen want to continue to fish. But if they cannot, they are realists. They recognise that they cannot stand in the way of $17 billion or hundreds of billions of dollars of projects that will provide many thousands of jobs. They understand that. But if they are to be removed or if their fishing grounds are to be removed or taken away from them or put out of limits, then there have to be more fishing grounds given to them to compensate for the loss. If that cannot be done, then they have to be compensated to get out of the industry. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  I too rise to speak on the matter of public importance. I wanted to take up some of the points Senator Boswell has made, in that we all support the creation of jobs and opportunity in Queensland. I think everyone supports the opportunities that will be presented by the expansion of the terminal at Abbot Point, the Adani project at Abbot Point, the Arrow LNG facility on Curtis Island and the Arrow gas pipeline to Curtis Island. I think even the Greens support the opportunities that jobs will bring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me put forward a note of caution which Senator Boswell did not instil into the debate: it is not only the caveats that Minister Hunt would put on the project to ensure that it meets environmental conditions, it is also the implementation of that to ensure that those conditions are met. It will create opportunity, but it will also create concerns in respect of the environment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a world-class environment. We have the Great Barrier Reef, which is world recognised. GBRMPA itself—that is the body that looks after the Great Barrier Reef—also has a policy which deals with how to manage the dredging and dredging disposal. This is an issue that has continued for some time and has been dealt with through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, where they provide for how dredging and dredging material disposal will be dealt with, but what is really important here is not only how you manage the issues of dredging through the GBRMPA. With ports within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, you also have to deal with how you are going to manage the terminals, the storage and waste facilities, the cargo, the loading and unloading facilities—all of these things which are part and parcel of the development of operations such as the expansion at Abbot Point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us come back to what the coalition are doing. Before the election, the Abbott government announced in their environmental policy:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We will streamline the environmental approval process for all users—resulting in less duplication across federal and state jurisdictions and delivering a real boost to the nation’s productivity. We will establish a one-stop shop environmental approvals process covering both Commonwealth and state legislation, that maintains high environmental standards, delivers certainty for all users and importantly makes swift decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you take out the broad motherhood statement that it is seeking to achieve, streamlining—as they call it—is a positive sounding proposition. However, offloading powers to the states without proper oversight and without proper conditions put in place may have a detrimental effect on the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are talking about is the devolution of the powers from the federal government not to another state—let us look at the specifics. Let us look at what the Newman government has been doing, because they will be part and parcel of the management of the expansion at Abbot Point to make sure not only that jobs and the economy get a boost but also that the environment is not detrimentally impacted as a consequence. In other words, there is a balance to be struck. I think Senator Boswell was going with the balance towards jobs and opportunity, forsaking the environment. If that was not what he was saying then it certainly sounded very much like it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Newman government cut funding to the environmental defenders office, which provides legal advice to individuals and community groups where they are resisting inappropriate developments—where you want an alternative voice to be heard, where you want a different argument to be put; they shut that down. In their second week in office the Newman government axed the entire Office of Climate Change. They then abolished the waste levy, making Queensland the only mainland state without one. Subsequently, waste from New South Wales is being transported to Queensland to be dumped. That is their response.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are the dirty mine water releases. The Newman government passed legislation, the Economic Development Bill, to allow for the release of excess mine water into the river systems. Subsequently, they announced a pilot mine water release program. They might call it, euphemistically, 'streamlining' the environmental process, but what it ultimately meant was that there would be a reduction in the environmental regulations and controls that are put in place in Queensland. They want to open up national parks to development with the nature conservation amendment bill—another euphemistic sounding name with a completely different result. Currently before the house in Queensland, this bill allows development in national parks. The Newman government initially stopped enforcing vegetation management penalties and has subsequently announced a review into the penalties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can start to feel, from the Queensland perspective, that you can start off with a very good program and position. But, in the case of the Newman government, it has chipped away at every environmental control and measure to reduce the burden in these areas to meet appropriate environmental standards. The concern is that in Queensland, in some of these regions—one of them could be Abbot Point—the Newman government might take the same approach </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So you might have a federal government effectively washing its hands of the environmental issue by passing it to the states and the states doing what the Newman government in this instance is doing, backsliding on environmental measures. That would certainly be a concern to this side. It clearly was not a concern to Senator Boswell. Of course, the Newman government reduced the solar feed-in tariff from 44c to 8c—another area where they do not want to assist the environment and what they do want to do is slide away from many of the environmental issues that have been fought and won over the last 10 to 15 years. That leads us to this: on the face of it, when you turn to the developments that are being proposed, the community has a right to be concerned about the potential environmental impacts of the project at Abbot Point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We expect the government to manage the project's progress and ensure the proponents meet their obligations under the agreement. The government has the responsibility to manage the Great Barrier Reef for everyone, for Australians from the tip of Cape York all the way down to Tasmania, and the onus then is clearly on this government to ensure that the project is managed properly and its decisions do not have a long-term detrimental effect in that region, particularly as to the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this issue the world is watching. It is the Great Barrier Reef and the world will hold us to account if we do not ensure proper environmental management is put in place. The world will not accept the excuse that we passed it to Queensland and Queensland dropped the ball on the issue. The world will not accept that. It will only look to us, from a Commonwealth perspective, to ensure that we get it right. In this instance, given all of the conditions, we say we will continue to hold this government to account. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="ka5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MILNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  I rise this afternoon to speak to this matter of the future of the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef is dying and this decision by the Abbott government to allow this massive port expansion development at Abbot Point, as a way of facilitating expansion of coalmining out of the Galilee Basin, will hasten the death of the reef. There is such a thing as being too late. For a very long time scientists have warned about the impacts of global warming on the Great Barrier Reef from coral bleaching, ocean acidification and extreme weather events bashing against the corals, which are already weakened by acidification.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Great Barrier Reef was listed as World Heritage in 1981. It is the largest coral reef ecosystem on Earth. It was regarded and listed as World Heritage because its values are of outstanding universal value to humankind. All Australians are proud of the Great Barrier Reef. But not all Australians are prepared to accept that it is dying. It is dying and we have to do everything we can to save what we can and build resilience, and you cannot pretend that allowing this massive coal port expansion, with the dumping of three million cubic metres of seafloor dredgings into the reef's waters, is going to do anything other than help to destroy it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you think about the reef, there are something like 1,500 species of fish, 360 species of hard corals and 1,500 species of sponges. There is the seagrass, which supports dugong populations and loggerhead, green, hawksbill and flatback turtles. There are 215 bird species. All these are sustained by the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem and what we now know, about that three million cubic metres to be dumped into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park waters, is that that sludge and those silts can travel for 80 kilometres. Please, do not expect anybody here to take seriously the notion of offsets—so we will dump all of this sludge into the Great Barrier Reef and then, however, we will say to the farmers, 'Don't you dump 4½ million cubic metres of sediment onto the reef,' and therefore we will have the farmers stop dumping theirs so we will dump from the coal port and that will be all right. Well, on the basic facts it is not all right. One basic fact is this. In its first five-year phase the reef rescue program, which was well resourced and had huge efforts from farmers backing it, only reduced the sediments entering the reef's waters by one-twentieth of the amount of sludge planned to be dumped offshore from Abbot Point, so 20 times more than has been able to be stopped in the last five years is being planned. So let us abandon this notion of enforcement and compliance—it will not happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a death sentence for the reef. Not only that, it will accelerate global warming because it is going to facilitate the Galilee Basin coalmines. That coal should stay in the ground. There is no way we should be opening up the Bowen Basin or the Galilee Basin to coalmining, because those two basins alone, if they were a separate country, would be the seventh largest emitter on Earth. So when we hear the coalition go on about what a small emitter Australia is in the global context of climate change, let us note that the seventh largest emitter on Earth would be the two basins in Queensland if you let this go ahead. So not only is this being done for the sake of the coalminers but it is going to kill the reef and accelerate global warming and a feedback loop also goes on towards killing the reef. This is a crime against humanity. That is what it is, and it has got the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott's, and the Minister for the Environment, Greg Hunt's, names all over it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, at the World Heritage Committee meeting in Cambodia, the World Heritage Committee was asked to consider the Great Barrier Reef for inscription on the list of World Heritage in danger, for it to be recommended and to be thought about for the 38th session in 2014. I would suggest that the result of the Abbott government's decision to go ahead with this massive industrialisation of the reef is going to lead to the Great Barrier Reef being listed as World Heritage in danger. That is a major blow to jobs and tourism in Queensland. I can tell you that tourists, divers, people interested in the marine environment are not going to come to Australia, to the Great Barrier Reef, if it is listed as in danger. That is a signal that Australia does not care about it, is letting it go, that it is in bad condition, and they will go to other coral reefs around the world. New Caledonia, for example, has the world's second largest barrier reef. That will become a preferred destination, as will other coral reefs elsewhere in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Up to 63,000 jobs depend on the Great Barrier Reef, and that has a major flow-on for Queensland. I was up there during the federal election campaign and, make no mistake, businesses along the reef are very worried about it. They are also worried that the tourism bodies along the Great Barrier Reef should be shouting from the rooftops about this but are not doing so. The reason they are not doing so is that they have been taken over and they are being financially supported by the mining industry. So when Premier Newman said Queensland is open for the coal business, he meant it! He meant that Queensland was prepared to sell out, and now the Abbott government is going to be complicit with him in destroying the Great Barrier Reef in order to massively expand Queensland's appalling coalmining when, in fact, it should be left in the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The same goes for coal-seam gas, which is facilitating loss of water and loss of farmland; it is climate destroying. In fact, the latest greenhouse gas inventory shows the greatest increase in emissions is in fugitive emissions from coalmines and coal-seam gas. So we are not only going to see a shocking contribution to global warming, we are also going to see a loss of jobs, a loss of tourism and the listing of the reef as in danger. But the overwhelming issue here is the loss of the reef itself. I do not think Australians can actually take in the fact that there will come a day when the Great Barrier Reef is dead. That is something that people refuse to accept. You hear people say—quietly—when they go to Queensland and have a look at it that it is in a worse state than the last time they saw it. We are also seeing the impacts: when you have deteriorating water quality, you have also the expansion of the crown-of-thorns starfish. What we are seeing is a disaster for the reef and a disaster for the planet, and the world is not going to stand by and watch Australia do this. We are going to have a major issue to contend with in terms of where this goes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What will happen to the Queensland economy? We know the Great Barrier Reef is a major economy from the tourism and from the small businesses that will be impacted. The dredging will also impact on fisheries, not to mention what it will do to us, as a nation, to be a rich nation that is prepared to destroy outstanding universal values for humankind. This contempt that the Abbott government is showing for the environment is something that you would not even have been believed a few years ago—that you could see in one week a government taking away the powers to look after threatened species, taking away the critical listing for the Murray-Darling Basin, attacking the Tasmanian wilderness World Heritage area and threatening to pull down and change the boundaries to open up the old-growth forests for logging. And now today we have this decision by the government to proactively turn the Great Barrier Reef into a coal ship highway, and to allow the dumping of three million cubic metres of sludge into the reef to smother corals and to smother seagrasses on which dugongs and turtles are reliant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a disgrace and people will be held accountable for this, not just now but by future generations. They will look back and say, 'This was environmental vandalism, and never let it be said that they did not know what they were doing'. You know exactly what you are doing. Scientists around the world have condemned you for what you are doing to the Great Barrier Reef. They have pleaded with you not to proceed with this industrialisation of the Great Barrier Reef, and yet you are going on to do it in the interests of the supporters of the coalition. The big coalminers of Australia have now pulled the strings of the Abbott government to the detriment of the Great Barrier Reef. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:57</span>):  I am not sure if I am speaking on the right motion here. I thought we were celebrating a decision finally being made, after more than five years, to drag Queensland's economy out of the dumps. Apparently we are not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was a little surprised earlier to hear Senator Boswell correct himself. He pointed out that there would be thousands of jobs come out of these projects that were approved yesterday by Minister Hunt. Senator Boswell went on to talk about hundreds of thousands of jobs and then corrected himself for being a little overblown in the language he had used. I think he can hold his head up high; I do not think he needs to worry about exaggeration when he is followed by a speaker who wants to talk about developing a coalmining port in Queensland as a crime against humanity. What has been a crime—an economic crime—in Queensland for more than five years is the way the state Labor Bligh government and the federal Labor government conspired to stop development, conspired to simply build up the debts of Queensland and not to go ahead with perfectly reasonable, perfectly adequate provisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The four projects that were approved yesterday by Minister Hunt will generate 3½ thousand jobs in their doing. And, as Senator Boswell pointed out earlier, the people of Mackay, of Gladstone and of Bowen are pleased to see these jobs happening. As the Deputy Premier and Minister for State Development, Infrastructure and Planning in Queensland, Jeff Seeney, has pointed out, these jobs will give a desperately needed boost to Queensland's coal and coal-seam gas industries. Mr Seeney has described the decision by Mr Hunt yesterday as a common-sense decision by the Commonwealth government that will encourage growth in Queensland's resource sector and underpin future jobs in the coal and coal-seam gas sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He goes on to point out that this is after Australia's longest and most comprehensive assessment process that has produced the strictest environmental conditions ever seen in Australia's history. If you look at the actual conditions that have been put on the projects, you will find 95 environmental conditions for the Abbot Point development and 53 for the Curtis Island LNG project. These are the environmental conditions that have been put in place. There are measures to protect marine species, the habitat, the ecological communities, and the flora and fauna.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am often a little bemused by the way the Greens pull the reef out of their pocket every time they want to convince people that they are right, that they are not overblown and that they are not criticising simply for the sake of criticising. It is a bit like the people who find a cute puppy to have their photo taken with. 'Let's criticise the work on the Great Barrier Reef. Let's not worry about development in Queensland'—I am sorry, but I am more interested in development in Queensland than I am in listening to ridiculous claims made by the Greens about what is going to happen to the Great Barrier Reef.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am hoping that Senator Milne's 63,000 figure for the number of jobs involved in tourism on the Great Barrier Reef is accurate. How dare the Greens tell the Queensland government in particular that the tourism associated with the Great Barrier Reef and the environmental health of the Great Barrier Reef are something they should try to notice. Tourism is a major industry in Queensland. The Queensland state government is very aware that tourism is a major industry. It is also aware that the Great Barrier Reef is a critical part of this. I can assure you that there will be nothing done by the Queensland government that would damage the Great Barrier Reef.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This point has been noted by Deputy Premier Seeney. He made the point that the conditions that have been put in place by the federal government under Minister Hunt will protect the reef but allow development to happen. They will allow development to happen in a more environmentally responsible way than had been intended under the Labor government and they will put in place a very well accepted and developed policy of expanding existing ports rather than building more ports so that one concentrates the economic activity in areas where it can be well monitored, surveyed and researched.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no suggestion whatsoever that the reef is threatened in any of the material put out following the decisions announced yesterday by Minister Hunt. That is not true. It is an untruth that is as overblown as the suggestion that the decisions made yesterday by Minister Hunt are a 'crime against humanity'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has imposed some of the strictest conditions in Australia's history. Among the things that will happen is that the water quality will be 1½ times better than it currently is. That is one of the requirements of the work. That will mean a long-term net reduction in fine sediments entering the marine park from land based sources. That will go on for years and years, well after the life of the project. Up to $89 million will be put into a reef trust to ensure the health of the Great Barrier Reef. As I mentioned earlier, there are 95 environmental conditions for Abbot Point and 53 for Curtis Island. Let us not forget that these projects that will not harm the reef but will grow jobs and the coal industry, which is the real bete noir that the Greens are out to stop—</span>

I find the Greens comments in this area immoral. If they are going to talk about actions by Minister Hunt as 'crimes against humanity' then their exaggerated and overblown comments in this area constitute immorality. I congratulate the federal government, the Minister for the Environment and the state government for the work they have done to finally bring these projects to fruition for the benefit of all Queenslanders, particularly those in the regions and those who live along the coast that is bordered by the Great Barrier Reef.</span>

                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  With humility and sincerity, I offer my respects to the traditional owners of this land, the first people who made their homes here and raised their families here, long before others discovered what a wonderful country this is. I acknowledge and honour their journey as custodians of the oldest surviving culture on earth.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Nobody can make the journey to this chamber alone. I am here because of the unfailing support of my family, my friends, my party and our movement. To family, who travelled across the world to come to this great nation; to the members of the Australian Labor Party; and to the people of my home state of New South Wales, I say thank you. Thank you also to the very many people who have travelled from afar to join us in the chamber today. I also pay my respects to my elders in this parliament, both the wonderful public servants and the elected representatives. Some of you are my team mates; some of you will be my sparring partners; but we are all here to serve the same great nation, and I thank all of you for the warm welcome I have received.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I arrived in Australia from Iran the year the Senate first met in this building. My parents, Naser and Ella, packed our suitcases in the middle of the freezing Iranian winter and left our tight-knit family, to bring my sister and me to Australia. They shared the dreams of opportunity that every parent has, but, more than that, they recognised that only by coming to this great country could they be certain that their children would grow up facing choices, rather than barriers. They were driven to their brave decision by an overwhelming commitment to their children. In so many ways, I owe this day to them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My parents met as young student activists, studying civil engineering. But they never completed university in Iran. They were expelled from university for joining the Iranian revolution, along with many of their friends, some of whom were imprisoned, tortured and even killed. For most of us it is difficult to imagine living with such fear and uncertainty. For my parents, it was a daily ordeal. The Shah of Iran fell in 1979. But when Ayatollah Khomeini returned from exile, my parents found themselves confronted by an equally repressive regime. A secular political tyranny had been replaced by a religious one. My Uncle Kamal and Aunt Nina, who are in the gallery today, fled across the border into Turkey, beginning a perilous journey that would eventually bring them to Australia. Fighting erupted along the border with Iraq in 1980, and three years later I was born into a country at war.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I was born in Sari, a small town in northern Iran, near the Caspian Sea. Funnily enough, my memories of childhood are all peaceful ones, of playing soccer, or football as we called it, in the street with the neighbourhood children, much in the same way as I would have been playing cricket had I been born in Australia. But what I did not know as a child was that my parents were consumed by fear of what the future would hold. I can only imagine their relief when, after years of anxiety, they learnt that they had been granted visas to migrate to Australia. I remember, as a five-year-old, boarding the train to Tehran from our small town in January 1988 and turning to my nine-year-old sister and asking if she thought we were still going to be back to see my grandparents on weekends. 'I mean, how far could Sydney really be?' It took us two days of continuous travel to reach Sydney. But the physical distance was nothing compared to the culture shock we were about to experience.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as it is today, Australia in the 1980s was a place of hope and tremendous opportunities, an island of peace and prosperity and a far cry from the war that had consumed our lives in Iran. Our plane landed in Sydney a fortnight before Australia's bicentenary celebrations. My father often reminds me of those first few days in the hot summer of 1988, when Australia was consumed by a nationwide bicentenary party. While the years ahead would involve a great deal of hard work, angst and sacrifice, my parents were celebrating too, for they had made it to a safe and just place and could focus on raising their family. Addressing the nation on that Australia Day, Bob Hawke, as the then Prime Minister, could have been speaking directly to this five-year-old boy when he said: </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, there is no hierarchy of descent; there must be no privilege of origin. The commitment is all.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Like all of you in this chamber, I have made my commitment very clear. Like all of you, my commitment is to Australia's future. I cannot think of anywhere else I would rather live. I cannot thank my family enough for their struggle to make it happen. They sacrificed their dreams, their aspirations and their careers so that my sister and I could have the life that we have been able to lead. My sister, Azadeh, is the star of the family. I could not be more proud of her—a Fulbright scholar, an accomplished lawyer and a respected academic, but, perhaps more importantly to me, a big sister who has always looked out for and believed in me. While Mum and Dad surely never imagined that I would have the great privilege of standing before you here today, the fact that it is possible is a testament to why they, and so many others, took that leap into the unknown. In words that every parent longs to hear: Mum and Dad, you were right all along.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I started my schooling in Blacktown in Western Sydney without being able to speak a word of English. Blacktown is the heart of Sydney's migrant hub, so I certainly was not the only immigrant in the class. My first best friend was a young Greek boy who unfortunately could not speak a word of Farsi. I could not speak a word of Greek. Nobody could speak any English. Yet they were some of the best conversations I ever had, until I came to this chamber: two kids from the other side of the world united in Blacktown by the aspirations of their parents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">While I was enjoying a fantastic public education, my parents worked tirelessly. Dad drove a taxi, and the entire family worked in a small cake shop. You know, there is no better way to learn about hard work and commitment than to work in a small family business. I would go there every day after school and work alongside my parents, my aunties and my uncle. They are here today, and I am sure they will happily recall that I was consistently fired on a weekly basis from a business that we all ran together, but I was nonetheless still expected to show up to work the next day—perhaps, just perhaps, igniting an early passion for workers' rights and the trade union movement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I know I am extremely fortunate not just to be standing here today, but to be in Australia at all. It is not a story that is unique to me. There are thousands of Australians who have taken a journey similar to mine. None of us in this chamber should ever forget that whatever our political differences, whatever the issues of the day, we are lucky to live in this great nation—a place that prides itself on pursuing opportunity and equality.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My own personal story has had a profound impact on my views and my aspirations for Australian society. I cannot help but feel for those who have not been so lucky. So let me put it plainly: I believe John Howard's calculated response to the Tampa affair appealed to the worst in us. It may have helped win an election but it hardened my resolve as a then 18-year-old living the Australian dream in Sydney's north-west.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Twelve years on and I believe we have not made nearly enough progress. The rhetoric of our national discussion about the so-called boat people still lacks a real sense of compassion. That is why I believe it is time for us to have a real conversation in this country about asylum seekers—a conversation that is not about the number of boats but about the names, the faces and the stories of the people they bring. A conversation that is not just about how we stop the boats but about what we can do to improve the situation of those so desperate that they would consider getting on those boats in the first place.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It is far too easy for us as politicians to exploit our community's natural fears of difference and change. I honestly believe we can do better than that. As politicians, we are privileged to be the voice of those who cannot always speak for themselves and we have a duty to do not just what is easy or popular but what is right—right for the weakest in our community, right for the hardest working and right for the long-term future of Australia. A better conversation about asylum seekers does not mean sacrificing our values or silencing honest criticism, but for the benefit of those who live here today and those who will live here tomorrow we need to take the politics out of this debate. That is what we need to do—stop the politics.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party is not the reason people risk their lives to come to Australia. The coalition parties are not the reason people wait 20 years in refugee camps to come here. The reason is the hope of a better future this country has to offer for persecuted people and their children. The fact is this is an incredible country and a beacon to people everywhere. Surely we can not only understand that but in fact feel a sense of pride that people see us here in Australia as a place of hope.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Immigration is not just about providing a home for people fleeing persecution and violence, though that is the progressive and enlightened thing to do. It is not just about enjoying cultural differences from all over the world, although every Australian has those benefits too. It is a question of national prosperity and it involves both Australia's humanitarian intake and our general migrant intake. Friends, we should be honest: the journey has not always been easy. The passage has not always been smooth. Mistakes have been made along the way. There has been grandstanding by politicians and attempts to divide Australia, and it has been going on for over 100 years. My own party's history of support for the White Australia policy, right up to the 1960s, is part of that story.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">But through all this we created a nation renowned for its safety, security and lifestyle. We should be proud that people want to live here and that our reputation across the globe is so strong. I challenge anyone in this chamber: come out to Granville, to Auburn, to Sydney's south-west and western suburbs. Visit our communities and deny that these new Australians are contributing to our economy and our culture. Overall, immigration adds to our national wealth. Immigration is nation-building. Immigration makes us strong. The people who come here will drive Australia's economic prosperity for years to come, and immigration is one of the great signs of optimism, of activism and of faith in the future of human history.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Friends, let me be clear: I unequivocally believe in a big Australia. My immigrant family put its faith and hope in a new land where they could give their children a new life. They were right to do so. Our immigrant nation puts its hope and faith in new people we know will make us stronger and fairer for decades to come. We are right to do so now. Our conversation about immigration should start from the same optimism, the same activism and the same faith in the future which has been the key to our success as a nation for over 200 years. But it does not, and I believe it is no coincidence that a country whose national conversation about immigration is so poor is also one where we are far too willing to predict hard times and focus on the negative.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia seems to be going through a period where we want to be down on ourselves. Our politics have become cynical and negative. Our media is too focused on our weaknesses rather than our strengths. There is no doubt in my mind that we can achieve far more as a nation by working together that we can against each other. Whenever possible, we must focus on the things that we have in common. We must stop letting the issues that divide us dominate our political landscape. It is not our role as politicians to focus on winning elections through cynical and negative politics. It is our role to be optimistic about Australia's future and to remind people what a great nation this is.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not to say that we do not face challenges, but I believe that there are no challenges too large for this nation to overcome. This is a country full of good people with a broad range of views. With bold leadership we can find compromise and consensus for the good of the nation. That is the best way forward. There is no reason that we cannot have the best hospitals, the best schools and the best economy in the world. There is no reason that Australian scientists cannot be at the forefront of the next big medical breakthroughs or that our entrepreneurs cannot be inventing the next big thing. But to achieve this we have to work together—the business community working hand in hand with the trade union movement, the wealthy and the privileged working hand in hand with those who are down on their luck, families who have lived here for generations working hand in hand with those who have just arrived here and, yes, from time to time, the Labor Party even working hand in hand with the coalition parties.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a great country. Indeed, this is the lucky country—not in the somewhat sarcastic sense that Donald Horne intended, but in the sincere sense in which Australians took up that phrase and made it our own. This is a great place to live and a great place to work. We are a nation of tremendous skills and natural resources. Friends, we are a nation whose best years are still ahead of us.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also a nation that has been very well served by the movement in politics that I represent. I joined the party that shared my optimism and my values. With inspiring national leaders like Whitlam, Hawke, Keating, Rudd and Gillard, it is little wonder that I was drawn to the Australian Labor Party. From a young age I was given an opportunity to get involved and be part of this movement. I am really proud to have played a role in reforming and revitalising the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party, the oldest branch of Australian Labor.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be forever grateful for the friendship and support of Jamie Clements, Michael Lee and Chris Minns during my time at the party office. Jamie, you are an extraordinary leader and you will take the New South Wales branch from strength to strength. I am so proud to have you as a close mate. Thank you to the amazing Kaila Murnain, who has become the first woman elected assistant secretary, the tenacious Courtney Roche and the ever-diligent Brendan Cavanagh. I could not have asked for a better team. I also want to thank John Graham for his enduring support. John, I have no doubt that the news that you were always prepared to cut a deal with me will do wonders for your own career!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another group of Labor people I want to thank. The eight-hour day which is now a standard for many workers throughout the world began in Sydney. This milestone was won by a group of stonemasons. These 19th century campaigners asked for eight hours of work, eight hours of recreation and eight hours of rest. This movement continues to seek improvements to our workplace safety conditions, hours of work and wages that benefit all of us in ways many of us rarely take pause to consider.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been fortunate to have had the invaluable friendship and guidance of many remarkable people. In particular I want to thank Mark Lennon, Gerard Dwyer, Barbara Nebart, Wayne Forno, Tony Sheldon—who is here with us today—Derrek Belan, Jim Metcher, Tara Moriarty, Mark Boyd, Graeme Kelly, Steve Butler, Tim Ayres, Jo-Anne Davidson and Alex Classens. Together we have not only reformed and rebuilt New South Wales Labor, but—let's face it—together we have we also kept half the Chinese restaurants in Sydney functioning!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not think it will come as a surprise to many that I married into a family as passionate about politics as I am. To my beautiful wife Helen, an independent woman who is both smarter and funnier than I am: you are an amazing mother to our two daughters, Hannah and Eloise, and the perfect partner in all that I do. I am truly thankful to share my life with someone as brilliant and supportive as you. Convincing you to marry me is the best campaign I have ever run. Helen's family has also become my own. Pat has welcomed me with open arms. Peter Barron, you are my father-in-law, my mentor and my friend. I cannot find the words to thank you, in no small part because you are the man I would usually turn to for a meaningful but witty one-liner.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In politics you are surrounded by friends when things are going well, but inevitably there are difficult days in this business, and I am lucky to have friends who support me in both the good times and the bad. My friend for life Sam Crosby and his amazing wife, Rose, have always been beside me and supported me from one crazy adventure to the next. To Josh McIntosh and his partner, Kate—Josh and I lived together for four years and I actually once calculated that I still owe him at least one year of rent—all I can say is, 'Unfortunately, once again, mate, the cheque is in the mail.' Sally Deans and Bob Nanva, you both have the amazing ability of being in politics but also being universally liked. Please, please, teach many of the people in this chamber how.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To Helen's many friends, in particular Chloe Bennett: you have become my friends too. Thank you for being there for Helen, especially for the long periods I have been away in the last job and in this one. To Prue Car, Damian Kassabgi, Paul Howes, Jim Chalmers, Walt Secord, Ernest Wong, George Wright, Anthony Chisholm, Daniel Mookhey, Gerard Gilchrist and Elizabeth Scully, who have shared my political journey with me, I will be forever indebted. I would not be here without your support. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke earlier of my parents' belief in opportunity. It is also a belief that they have instilled in me. It is a part of my family story, and it will no doubt be part of my parliamentary story too. I am fully aware of the privilege I have been granted to stand here and will work hard every day to deliver better opportunities for all Australians. After all, that is the least that the people of this great country—the country of the 'fair go'—deserve from their politicians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When I look back to my first few days in Australia, I recall a charismatic leader with his amazing silver hair and distinctive high-pitched voice speaking calmly and passionately about Australian ideals and our future. At the heart of Bob Hawke's speech was the idea of a modern, diverse nation, proud of its heritage and facing the future with confidence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Friends, never forget where you came from. You will always be shaped by your story. No matter what I am able to achieve and contribute, no matter where my story goes from here, there will always be a part of me that remains a wide-eyed five-year-old boy excited to have arrived in the greatest country on earth. Thank you.</span>

                <a href="249499" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator TILLEM</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  Thank you, Mr President. As I was making my way to the chamber last week—the bells were ringing, the lights were flashing and my pager was going off—I was asked by Senators Sterle and Gallacher why I always smile. I smile because it gives me great joy to be in this place representing the great state of Victoria. It is an honour and a privilege.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Representing Victoria is truly one of the highest honours I could aspire to. I love Victoria. I would like to take a moment to tell senators some of things I love about it. I love the smell of coffee as I walk through the Melbourne laneways in the morning and the pulse of excitement as the fans walk down Yarra Park to the MCG to watch my beloved Tigers play the greatest game in the world, AFL. I love driving down the many avenues of honour, with Bacchus Marsh being a particular favourite; the hustle and bustle of the Queen Victoria Market on a Saturday morning; the golden beaches stretching along the south coast, and the Great Ocean Road; and a pasta dish on Lygon St, fish and chips in Lorne or a noodle soup in Victoria Street.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">But what really makes Victoria great are Victorians. When the crowd chants, 'We love you 'cause you’re a Victorian!' at the Boxing Day test match, I know what they mean.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I am here replacing Senator David Feeney, whom I congratulate for his six years of service in this place. Senator Feeney resigned to run for the seat of Batman, which he won. I congratulate him on that victory and on his election to the opposition front bench. I wish him well for the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The decisions we take in this place have a profound effect on the lives of our fellow Australians. One of the main reasons I am here is a government policy. The policy I refer to was that of the Fraser government. In 1976, the Liberal Party 'acted humanely' on asylum seekers and illegal immigrants; that was a quote from the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Hon. Michael MacKellar. It was that humane act of a Liberal government that allowed an illegal immigrant at the time to become a citizen and to bring his wife and child to make a life, a better life, for his family. That illegal immigrant is my father, Ramazan Tillem.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My father left the home which he built as a young man. The house was made of rocks carried from the banks of a nearby riverbed. The mortar was straw and mud. The walls were whitewashed with lime scraped from caves in the nearby mountains. He left his wife and newborn son in search of a better life. He found that life in Australia. His story is the same as many thousands that have made Australia home. He told me recently that one of the first words he learnt when he came to this country was 'job'. He came here for a job and that is what he found. He walked up onto the factory floor and said, 'Job,' and he got one. My, what different times they were! He began at Toyota and then did a short stint at Dunlop. Ford was looking for hardworking men, so he helped them out for a little bit. But he finally found his home at Holden, where he worked for most of his life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">On this journey with my dad was Fatma, my mum. Having arrived in an unfamiliar place and speaking not a word of English she too sought out work. She worked on an assembly line at a biscuit factory; she made shoes at a small factory in Collingwood; she made electronic components at a company called Wilco; she sewed clothes for the ADF; and finally did some outwork from home.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The term 'sweat equity' was coined for my parents and thousands of parents like them. Their hard work meant that we could move out of high-rise public housing, on the 16th floor in Richmond. Borrowing $36,000 in 1981, and earning $170 a week, they bought what was to be our family home in Glenroy, where my brother, my sister and I grew up. Having left their families in search of a better life, they found that better life in Australia, where they could provide for their new family, where their kids could get an education and where recently, when they needed to, they could get health care in their advancing years. And now I get to thank them as a senator in the Australian parliament: thank you mum and dad.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been many influences in my life that have led me here. We are all products of our cultures, our families, our friends, the people we come across, the struggles we have, the battles we fight, our successes and our failures. Every person adds a little bit to who we become. I firstly acknowledge my wife, whose greatest gift to me is the little man who is sitting next to her. She is a wonderful mother to our son and words of thanks can never be enough. My little sister, Derya, is also here, and her greatest contribution to my career has been to tell me to get a real job. My brother, Zafer, and my sister-in-law Tulin cannot be here today, because they are now the proud parents of their first child, my niece, Aylin Tillem, who came into this world on Sunday. I congratulate them and wish them all the best. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate knows, I am sure, that I am the first person of Turkish origin and the second Muslim to serve in this parliament. In 1967 Australia signed an immigration treaty with Turkey, and today there are about 150,000 people of Turkish descent in Australia. Turkish Australians are very grateful for the opportunities this country has given them, for the freedom and the prosperity they have found here. Overwhelmingly, they have taken up Australian citizenship.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a proud product of the Victorian state education system. I went to Glenroy Primary School, University High School and RMIT. This upbringing, with a public school education and a hardworking family, instilled in me values that stay with me and will continue to do so—and one of them is the importance of community. I believe in strong community life. Although the world is growing ever smaller, many people are increasingly isolated from their communities. I hope in this place we can do something to change that. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Australian Turkish community, I was raised to believe in kindness, in charity and in faith. My faith, which I inherited from my parents, has guided me throughout my life. But I have learnt throughout my whole life that religious discrimination is not an answer; it is the problem. If I disagree with anyone in this chamber and in this place, it will be because of your political views and your poor argument. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Turkey and Australia have a longstanding relationship that was forged across battlelines. We stand as two nations that have grown from a beginning as enemies, when lots of lives were lost. In 1915 the Anzacs landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula, or Gelibolu Yaramadasi, as the Turks call it. For eight months, Australians and Turks fought each other. There was grave loss of life, but from that loss came a bond and a friendship that has endured for 100 years. Every year thousands of Australians—and young Australians—venture to Gallipoli to see the places where their great-grandfathers fought, and the Turkish government welcomes them with open arms. They see the mass graves where more than 60,000 Turkish soldiers died and are buried, and the places where more than 8,700 Australians are buried. They also see the words of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who was the front-line commander at the time of Gallipoli. I am sure you have heard these words, but I will repeat them: </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">… you, the mothers, who sent their sons from faraway countries, wipe away your tears; your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace. After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Today Turkey is a nation of 75 million people, and an increasingly prosperous and important regional power, forming as it does a bridge between Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The bond of shared sacrifice on the shores of Gallipoli is a valuable one, and honourable Senators Ronaldson and Farrell will have an important role to play in fostering a stronger diplomatic and economic relationship leading up to the 100th anniversary of the Anzacs. Australian exports to Turkey in 2011 were worth well over $600 million. We run a healthy trade surplus with Turkey, but investment and trade could be a lot more. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was sworn in a little while ago, I was struck by the fact that none of the four senators sworn in that day was from a traditional Anglo-Australian background. I was born in Turkey, Senator Seselja is the son of Croatian immigrants, Senator Peris is the first Indigenous woman to become a member of this parliament, and the junior senator on my left, Senator Dastyari, was born in Iran. We join a Senate which is increasingly multicultural—that is, a Senate which reflects a vibrant Australia. On this side, we have Senator Wong, who was born in Malaysia, while Senator Singh is of Fijian-Indian background. On the other side, Senator Abetz is German, and Senator Cormann is from Belgium. Senator Fierravanti-Wells is of Italian background, and Senator Sinodinos, a neighbour of mine, is from Greece. We have Senators Di Natale and Xenophon continuing the Mediterranean theme, and even Senator Bernardi has his origins in other parts. Yet we are all Australians, sharing common Australian values, sharing common civic responsibilities and all working for the benefit of our common homeland. That is one of the things that gives me faith in the future of this country. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I strongly believe that the best is yet to come for Australia, but if we are to achieve that we need a government that will be committed to the values that have brought us this far. I hope the current government is committed to those values, but they will be judged by their actions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I joined the Labor Party 20 years ago, inspired by the leadership of Hawke and Keating. My values are Labor values: fairness, equality, solidarity, and an economy and a parliament that serve the people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Victoria is Australia's manufacturing heartland. I will be an advocate in this Senate for Victorian jobs and—my speech was going to say we would be negligent if we let companies like Holden fall; so I guess we are negligent. Many thousands of people would be affected by the failure and collapse of manufacturing, and my home state of Victoria would be affected, I think, worst of all.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a shared a common responsibility to look after the citizens of this country and we cannot do that selectively. A job gives every Australian immense self-worth and dignity. I will fight for the rights of all Australians: to be able to work, to give our kids the opportunity for an education just like I got, to get health care and to look after those that need our help. These are Labor values and, I believe, the values of most Australians. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I was proud to stand as a candidate in September for a party which had saved Australia from recession during the global financial crisis, which had built new school buildings across the country, which was rolling out the National Broadband Network, which had legislated for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and which was tackling climate change. But as a party we need to do some questioning about what went wrong, what happened. Despite the great legislative record we can point to, we lost that election.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe Labor has made a great start in regaining the confidence of the electorate. Opening up the election of our new federal parliamentary leader to the rank-and-file members of the party was a great innovation, and party members were lucky that we had two excellent candidates from which to choose. But we need to do a lot more to reform our party, to make it once again what it always should be: the natural voice for the great majority of Australians who want moderate, sensible, stable and progressive government; a government which works for the benefit of lower- and middle-income families; a government which plays an active role in the economy and in building national infrastructure; and a government which enhances the rights and freedoms of Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a product of the rank and file of the ALP—from the grassroots, from the membership. I am proud of the role that I have played in the institution. The time for real reform within the ALP is overdue. We made great strides in electing our leader with real input from the ALP membership, and now it is time for state branches to do the same. Since the election, ALP membership across Australia has surged. If we are to retain those members and attract more, we have to give our members a real say in the way the party is run and the way it chooses its candidates. We need to rethink our relationship with stakeholders. I congratulate groups like Local Labor and Open Labor on the work they have done on this front. We have too often taken away the rights of members, and the membership are demanding we give it back to them. I will be a champion of this cause. I will make the argument at branch meetings. I will make the argument at our conferences. I will make the argument in every forum that I can.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many policy issues that I would like to talk about, but in the time available to me today I will limit them to two. The first is an important one, housing affordability, and where I come from, in Melbourne's north, it is a real problem. It is the dream of most Australians not to buy a house but to buy a home. The reality of homeownership in this country is that it is increasingly out of reach for most people. There are many reasons for that, but one important reason is negative gearing. The tax system currently provides incentives for investors to buy up residential properties and use them to reduce their tax bill. Not only does this divert investment from more productive purposes; it also drives up the price of housing, making it much more difficult for young families to buy their own homes. Negative gearing creates a transfer of wealth from low-income renters and homebuyers to high-income investors. This is not the way to encourage homeownership for low- and middle-income families, an objective which I believe is shared by both sides of the chamber. I believe it is time to once again have a debate about the effect of negative gearing on housing affordability in our cities.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue I want to touch briefly on is organ donation. Despite the best efforts of successive governments in this country, Australia still has one of the lowest rates of organ donation in the developed world. For a country that leads in lots of areas, we are lagging behind in this one. We are lagging behind countries like Spain, Croatia and Belgium, and it is because of the system we have. Organ donation, what we can do after we have passed away, is something that we can hang our hats on as a legacy to those that come after us. We have an opt-in system, which means that a person must agree in advance that, in the event of their death, their organs can be used for transplantation. In other countries where they have an opt-out system, under which a deceased person's organs may be used unless they have previously refused permission, they are getting great results and huge numbers. We need to look at what we can do in this country to move to such a system. We could save many lives, young and old. There was recently the story of the young girl in Queensland who helped save a life, and she is a shining light to all of us, one we should follow. I will be using my time in the Senate to advocate for an opt-out system in Australia.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I finish, there are some people I want to thank for their efforts in making it possible for me to be here today. I will begin with a couple of Stephens. There is Senator Conroy, whom I know I will be friends with for a very long time, because I know too much. And there is my longest friend in politics, Stephen Newnham, who when we first met provided me with direction and support. From the other place there is Richard Marles, who provides me some balance and a positive view on things when I think the glass is half empty. There are my state parliamentary colleagues John Hamdi Eren, who has always been there when I needed support, and Telmo Languiller—'Hold your nerve,' he told me, and I did. Thanks, Telmo.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to make special mention of Wayne Mader, the secretary of the Victorian branch of the Transport Workers Union, without whose support I would not be here. A more genuine person I will not meet. I am also grateful for the support I received from Tim Kennedy, Michael Donovan, Kevin Bracken and Joan Doyle during my preselection. My thanks to Noah Carroll, the State Secretary of the Victorian branch of the ALP, and a friend, for the great work he is doing in Victoria. My thanks to Cesar Piperno, who has always been there in support of our work on a local level, and to Steve Le for his insights into the world of sport.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My heartfelt thanks and gratitude go to Ella George and Samuel Thomas Rae for their hard work over the years and for putting up with me. And I am grateful for the local support I receive from councillors Oscar Yildiz and Michael Teti, and for the steady hand of Ali Ouaida and the whole Ouaida family locally.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to make special mention of the Turkish community, where I come from, and in particular the Denizli community, which is the homeland of my parents, and their president, Mr Sadik Sozer, who cannot be here with us today because last week we lost a much-loved member of our community in a tragic and brutal act of violence. My thoughts are with the family of Mr Omer Ali Aysel.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I forget, I will thank my staff, who I know I have been riding pretty hard recently: Hashem, Alfred, Ridvan, Susan—and I know I am going to forget someone, so I do apologise. But I am not going to forget Bridget—thank you for reminding me, Sam—because today is Bridget's birthday, and I wish her a happy one.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">While I am in the Senate, I will be working every day to repay their faith, to argue the case for Labor and to represent the voices of Victorians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to finish off by talking about someone who I have not spoken about so far. At this point I want to talk about my son, Mikail, who asked me if he could stand up when I talked about him, and he duly has. When I got appointed to the Senate I was driving him to school one day, having explained to him what the Senate does, and he asked me if I had 'made any laws yet, Dad?' I said no, I had not. He went, 'Well, what're you going to do?' I said, 'Well, do you have any suggestions?' Thoughtfully, he put his hand to his cheek and said: 'You know what, Dad? You should make a law where you make more schools, because not all the kids can fit on the mat.' And for that policy suggestion I thank him. Son, I am proud of you every single day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0P" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FURNER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>): I find it a privilege to be able to speak on this matter of public importance today about the decision on Abbot Point. As a Queenslander, it gives me great pride to be in a position to make some contribution to this debate. It was not that long ago that Senator Boyce and I, on many occasions in the lead-up to the election, were bumping into one another up the coast of Queensland, no doubt speaking to constituents about particular issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One particular area that I found a matter of importance and concern for people in the area around Bowen and the Great Barrier Reef was what would happen in the circumstances of the advancement of the expansion of the Abbot Point wharf. I went to the Bowen markets on a Sunday morning. Like any markets, you walk around and talk to many locals. I found that people had a diverse range of opinions on whether the wharf expansion should proceed or be stopped because of the likelihood of effects on the reef. So I think it is important that we consider the government's position in managing the progress of the project to ensure that proponents meet the obligations set out in the agreement that has been reached and was announced yesterday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government really has a responsibility in this area to the Great Barrier Reef. There is a great expectation within the community and internationally for them to do it properly. I had a look at the agreement today to see what the requirements are of this government in proceeding with this project, and I must admit there are a number of listed requirements that are put on the federal government to make sure these matters are reached. There are things like pile driving operations and listing the species of turtle, dolphin, dugong, humpback whale and so on. But I am concerned about who is going to be entrusted with the responsibility to make sure those requirements are met. Is it going to be a situation where the Queensland Liberal National Party government is going to be bestowed with the opportunity to ensure that checklists are crossed off? We know that in Queensland there have been over 14,000 jobs—primarily in the public service—cut with regard to the decision the premier up there made when he came to power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the particular area of public servants that I assume would be responsible for the reporting of these operations—the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection—there were 220 jobs cut. One of the casualties I know personally; Sandra Flanagan, who resides up in Rockhampton and is a very good friend of mine, was distraught that a long-term, engaged public servant lost her job as a result of those severe cuts the Queensland Liberal National Party government made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So that is my question: who is going to be protecting and ensuring these requirements are met, to ensure the reef is not going to be put at risk and the companies that are going to be doing all this extension are conforming with the requirements the federal government has put upon them? When you look back in time, the then opposition—I will use an example I am very familiar with—does not have a very good track record. I use the example of a private members' bill. Mr Abbott sought to have a piece of legislation in this chamber overturned with regard to a piece of state legislation concerning wild rivers in the northern part of my home state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One wild river that I am very familiar with as a result of my great relationship with the Irwins up on the Sunshine Coast is the Wenlock River. I have been fortunate enough to have visited that area on several occasions through work and other things. I have been fortunate to have been welcomed onto the Indigenous lands up in that area and to actually jump a crocodile on the banks of the Wenlock River, to do the research and examination of a reptile that was about 10½ feet long. To see those sorts of pristine areas and the environment we have in our great state of Queensland makes me concerned that these sorts of measures will not be a check when it comes time to make sure these issues are met.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I advocate to anyone if they get the opportunity: get up to North Queensland. I am talking right up around the cape. See those beautiful rivers and the environment we have around that area. They are the types of areas where we should not go in full steam ahead, particularly when we have lost public servants in Queensland and are not able to make sure these checks and balances are met.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, we need to ensure that reasonable commitment is given by the federal government to make sure these matters are checked and reasonable safeguards are put in place. We heard today during question time, from questions by the Greens, that there are claims the government have provisions and procedures well in advance of what we had as a government, but I will believe it when I see it. There are something like 63,000 jobs that have some input from the area of the Great Barrier Reef. It ranges from tourism to recreational fishers and all sorts of walks of life. We know that, if this particular matter is not managed appropriately, we will lose up to $6 billion in tourism, a significant contribution to tourism in the state of Queensland and also the Commonwealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I would like to ensure that these matters are dealt with appropriately and with competence. Also, as I have indicated, I have some concerns about the degree of commitment that this federal government has to the environment on some of the issues that I have raised—for example, the private member's bill by Mr Abbott dealing with the wild rivers legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been other advocates out there expressing concerns as well. I can refer to one piece of media. I note claims that the dredging being proposed by three coal terminals will dump three million cubic metres of spoil onto the Great Barrier Reef. That has been raised as an issue by Richard Leck of the World Wildlife Fund, who has claimed that the spoil dumped on the World Heritage area would be equivalent to 150,000 dump trucks. He says, 'It can smother whatever it lands on whether that be seagrass or coral'—or turtles, dugongs or dolphins, or anything in that area of the ocean. Surely that would raise concerns for anyone who has a genuine issue with the management of the expansion of the Abbot Point facility. We are not in a position as the opposition to oppose or—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The need for Schedule 1 of the Bill has arisen as a result of a recent Federal Court decision (<span style="font-style:italic;">Tarkine National Coalition Incorporated v Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities [2013] FCA 694</span>). In that decision, the Federal Court declared an approval for a project invalid because the court found that the decision-maker did not have regard to a relevant approved conservation advice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The provision applies to ensure that decisions before 31 December 2013 are not put at risk of being invalid.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">All six species of marine turtles found in Australian waters are listed as threatened under the EPBC Act, with loggerhead, leatherback and olive ridleys listed as endangered, while green, hawksbill and flatback turtles are listed as vulnerable. Dugong and turtles are also listed as both migratory and marine species under the EPBC Act. Further, turtles and dugong are protected species under the Marine Park Act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The EPBC Act currently contains various criminal offences relating to the killing, injuring, taking, trading, keeping or moving of turtles and dugong where they are a listed threatened, migratory or marine species. Likewise, the Marine Park Act currently contains criminal offences and civil penalty provisions which apply to the taking of, or injury to, turtles and dugong where they are a protected species under that Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Concerns have been raised with me that the current penalty provisions in the EPBC Act and Marine Park Act are not high enough to protect turtles and dugong from the increasing threats of poaching, illegal hunting and illegal transportation and trade. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The increased penalties will deter people from committing offences or breaching civil penalty provisions under the Acts, thereby providing additional protection for turtles and dugong from the threats of poaching, illegal hunting and illegal transportation and trade. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013 is to strengthen the role of Infrastructure Australia, as an independent, transparent and expert advisory body through a change in its governance structure and through better clarification of its functions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's future growth will be significantly influenced by our capacity to deliver more appropriate, efficient and effective infrastructure and transport. Investment in nationally significant infrastructure is central to growing Australia's productivity and improving the living standards of Australians now and in the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">To maximise productivity improvement through investment, funding must flow to projects that yield the highest benefits. Therefore, it is critical to base project selection on rigorous analysis and sound planning to avoid wasteful investment.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government fully supports Infrastructure Australia in its role as a key advisor to government on infrastructure project and policy reforms, it is committed to strengthening it by restructuring its governance, clarifying the scope of its responsibilities and entrenching its role as a key advisor to government.</span>

It is the government's position that it is not appropriate for Australia's <span style="font-style:italic;">non-refoulement</span> obligations under the CAT and the ICCPR to be considered as part of a Protection visa application under the Migration Act.

Australia remains committed to adhering to our <span style="font-style:italic;">non-refoulement</span> obligations under the CAT and the ICCPR. Anyone who is found to engage Australia's <span style="font-style:italic;">non-refoulement</span> obligations under these treaties will not be removed from Australia in breach of these obligations.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Introducing the complementary protection criteria into the Protection visa framework goes beyond the requirements of the Refugees Convention.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since the commencement of the complementary protection provisions on 24 March 2012 only 57 applications have satisfied the requirements for the grant of a Protection visa on complementary protection grounds. This begs the question as to why it was necessary to introduce complementary protection into a statutory framework which required a complementary protection assessment to be undertaken for every asylum seeker. This was a costly and inefficient way to approach the issue given the small number of people who meet the complementary protection criterion. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In fact, by far the greatest proportion of people who engage Australia's protection obligations are currently captured under the Refugees Convention.  The interpretation of the Refugees Convention grounds has evolved to encompass wide ranging protection issues where a person's claims are able to form a nexus to the Refugees Convention, including such examples as women fleeing 'honour killings' and female genital mutilation.  </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">On the other hand, in a number of cases that have been found to meet the complementary protection criteria, people who have committed serious crimes in their home countries, or people who are fleeing their home countries due to their association with criminal gangs or their involvement in blood feuds, have been found to engage protection. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia accepts that the position under international law is that Australia's <span style="font-style:italic;">non-refoulement</span> obligations under the CAT and the ICCPR are absolute and cannot be derogated from. However, there is no obligation imposed upon Australia to follow a particular process or to grant a particular type of visa to those people for whom <span style="font-style:italic;">non-refoulement</span> obligations are engaged. This is particularly the case where people are of security or serious character concern and they do not meet the criteria for grant of a Protection visa. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If a person cannot be returned to their home country, the way to resolve the person's status will be to rely on the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection's personal and non-compellable intervention powers to consider granting a visa. This will be the case regardless of whether a person of security or character concern has been assessed against the complementary protection criterion in the Migration Act or as part of an administrative process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The complementary protection provisions that were introduced in the Migration Act by the previous government are complicated, convoluted, difficult for decision-makers to apply, and are leading to inconsistent outcomes. Moreover, while the intention was to interpret and implement Australia's <span style="font-style:italic;">non-refoulement</span> obligations under the CAT and the ICCPR without expanding the obligations in a way that goes beyond current international interpretations, the courts have since broadened the scope of the interpretation of these obligations beyond that which is required under international law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, the risk threshold test for assessing whether a person engages Australia's complementary protection obligations has this year been lowered to the same 'real chance' threshold as under the Refugees Convention. Another effect of the court decisions is that even where a person's home country has a functioning and effective police and judicial system, in order for Australia to conclude that that country will in fact seek to, and manage to protect the person from the risk of harm, the protection by that country's authorities must reduce the level of harm to below that of a 'real chance'. The 'real chance' test is a very low bar and lower than required under the CAT and the ICCPR. The court's interpretation of who should be provided complementary protection has transformed provisions intended to be exceptional into ones that are routine and extend well beyond what was intended by the human rights treaties. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Through removing the complementary protection criterion from the Migration Act, it is the government's intention to re-establish the consideration of complementary protection issues within an administrative process similar to that which was undertaken prior to the enactment of the complementary protection legislation. This consideration will happen either as part of pre-removal procedures which are undertaken by departmental officials to assess whether the removal of an asylum seeker could engage Australia's <span style="font-style:italic;">non-refoulement</span> obligations or through the use of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection's discretionary and non-compellable intervention powers under the Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Considering complementary protection issues under an administrative process allows the government to regain control over Australia's protection obligations and assess whether a person's specific circumstances engage Australia's non-refugee <span style="font-style:italic;">non-refoulement </span>obligations, as interpreted by the Government in accordance with international law. This will allow the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection to consider a range of options for resolving the person's immigration status including the consideration of the exercise of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection's personal and non-compellable public interest powers under the Act to grant either a temporary or a permanent visa. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This evening I would like to address both the Aged Care Subsidies Amendment (Workforce Supplement) Determination and the Residential Care Subsidy Amendment (Workforce Supplement) Principle. The principle and determination of course need to be moved separately, but we have agreed to move them together. But really they are both a result of the same trend—that is, the coalition's lack of focus and commitment in the area of aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These instruments, made under the Aged Care Act 1997, will unwind key reforms instituted by Labor to ensure that the nation's aged care workers receive a welcome and overdue boost in pay and conditions. The Gillard government introduced the Aged Care Workforce Subsidy part of the Living Longer Living Better aged care package in order to address workforce pay and conditions. It is important to remember that aged care workers are some of our lowest paid workers in the country yet they are charged with the immense responsibility of caring for the increasing number of older Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We often speak of Australia's ageing population and the challenges that lie ahead as though it were something yet to happen. Those challenges are already here. For the first time in our nation's history there are more people turning pension age each year, than there are turning working age. Yet the aged-care sector has a high turnover of staff, and workers are paid less than colleagues in other sectors such as hospitals. I recognise that many workers in this sector are motivated by compassion and a sense of vocation but they still deserve to be given fairer pay, better conditions and access to training, education and a career path.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sector faces pressure not only from an increase in the demand for their services, but also from a population that expects more. This workforce needs assistance and now is not the time to be turning our backs on those workers who give so much for so little. Federal Labor understands these pressures, which is why we allocated $1.2 billion dollars across the forward estimates to address significant workforce issues. The workforce supplement is the mechanism through which the wages of aged-care workers caring for older Australians will be improved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is extremely disappointing that the coalition does not share our concern. In fact, one of the first acts of the Minister for Social Services was to make a determination through these two instruments to remove the department secretary's power to accept applications for the workforce supplement. This is despite the fact that some 18 providers have already successfully applied for the supplement since 1 July 2013. So what is the coalition planning to do with the remaining $1.1 billion?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All we have from those opposite are platitudes followed by cuts. All we have heard is that the government will reallocate to a:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not that we know what this means, how they will guarantee that workers will not be worse off or how they will address the demands on this sector. The timing could not be worse. At this time, we need to be doing everything possible to boost the working conditions of aged-care staff and encourage younger people to take up work in this sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission has pointed out that increasing numbers of residents with higher and more complex care needs have added to the workloads of care staff in residential care settings. As we speak, some 50 per cent of the aged-care workforce is within 10 years of retiring, and it is proving particularly challenging to attract young capable people to undertake this line of work.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor remains committed to building a new aged-care system built on the principles of respect, dignity and choice. We want to make sure that every single facility can provide quality, affordable, accessible and appropriate care to a rapidly growing population of older Australians. If only the coalition shared our dream. Instead, they want to scrap the supplement and, on top of this, the government has not indicated how the funds will be allocated to providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My aim in moving to disallow these instruments is to give workers more time to negotiate better outcomes with their employers and to provide the minister and his assistant minister with more time to provide details on how they will address workforce issues. This regrettable decision by the minister has only added greater uncertainty to a workforce that is already lowly paid while working with some of the most vulnerable and demanding Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During question time this week, the minister who is at least nominally responsible for ageing, Senator Fifield, said that it was a government priority to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… allow those who work in aged care to focus on doing what they do best, and that is delivering high-quality care for older Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, Minister Fifield—it is good that you are here in the chamber—you certainly are not acting like it. Words are cheap. Older Australians and the people who work diligently every day to care for them want a real commitment. I trust the government will take the time to address the pay and working conditions of this vulnerable sector. My honourable colleagues may want to consider who they would want caring for them in their twilight years. Given the choice, would we really want a lowly paid, overworked person caring for us or even for our parents?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The manner in which the minister has moved to turn back progress for aged-care workers is shameful, and you should feel ashamed. Today, Labor is removing the prohibition on workers seeking better pay and conditions. We are clearing the way for providers and workers to sit down and continue negotiating.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were some significant qualifications in the previous government's Aged Care Workforce Supplement, and they included a requirement for certain aged-care providers to be part of an enterprise bargaining agreement with unions in order to access funds. That clearly was a cover for the Australian Labor Party in government yet again trying to use a sector in order to entrench further union membership. We on this side of the chamber are not at all against union membership. We recognise the important role that unions play in Australia, and that employees have an entitlement to be represented in the manner of their choosing. Our issue is that we do not believe that individuals should in any way be compelled, nor do we believe, for that matter, that employers should be placed in a position where they will be penalised or coerced through financial incentives to have a workplace that may do other than represent the free will of employees as expressed.</span>

                    </a>  So we had some difficulty with the Aged Care Workforce Supplement. We made clear before the election that if elected we would seek to suspend the workforce supplement. That is what we did when we came into government—Minister Andrews created a legislative instrument that would suspend further applications for that supplement. There were some 18 providers who had already been approved for the supplement, and we undertook that we would continue to ensure that those providers received that supplement, that payments to those people who had applied and reached agreement in good faith would continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we suspended further applications for the supplement, but we did indicate that we were committed to seeing the money that had been allocated to the workforce supplement returned to the general pool in aged care. We thought it was important to take a very different approach to that of the previous government in determining how best to deploy those resources. There was originally, I think, about $1.2 billion in the supplement. When you take into account the money that has already been allocated it is about $1.1 billion that is left.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than seeking to use that money to pursue particular industrial ends, as the previous government did, we want to take—and indicated that we would—a consultative approach with the sector. So we will sit down with the sector and work through how best to deploy that money. It is important to remember that we are talking about a very significant amount of money here: $1.1 billion. It is always important to remember that these are taxpayer dollars. We need to think very carefully about how best to deploy that money and so we will work in a cooperative way with the sector to determine how best to do that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the record, I should just read into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> what the coalition said before the election in relation to this funding. We said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a first priority, the Coalition will take the necessary steps to put back into the general pool of aged care funding the $1.2 billion allocated to the Workforce Compact and work with providers to ensure that these funds are distributed in a way that is more flexible and better targeted, without jeopardising the viability of aged care facilities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that is exactly what we will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should also share with you, Mr Deputy President, the release which explains the rationale for what we are doing. I will just briefly share it with you, because I know you take a close interest in this sector. This release was issued by me and Minister Andrews, and is headed 'Investing in the aged care workforce':</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Coalition Government today announced the first step in delivering on the Government’s Healthy Life, Better Ageing commitments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that increased pay and improved conditions are essential to attract and retain skilled workers to the sector, while being affordable and sustainable. Recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of skilled, dedicated workers to the aged care sector is crucial for Australia’s aged care system to meet the community’s increasing need for aged care services.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Aged Care Workforce Supplement introduced by the former government did not guarantee improved pay and conditions for all aged care workers and many providers could not justify applying because the Supplement would not have covered their additional costs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that is an important point. It continued:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">For many providers the funding was also conditional upon the signing of a union-dictated EBA.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This goes to the point I was making before, that the government does not believe that we should use particular sectors, and funding in particular sectors, to seek to achieve particular industrial outcomes that may be important to the Labor Party. The statement continues:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to working with the sector to develop a policy which will ensure that available funding is distributed in a way that is flexible, targeted and ensures the viability of aged care providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For this reason, the Government has taken the responsible step of suspending applications for the Workforce Supplement introduced by the former government while it consults with the sector on alternative policy options.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that is an unfamiliar concept to those opposite—to actually consult with the sector rather than having a predetermined agenda to achieve an industrial outcome. The statement continues:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Aged care providers that are eligible for the Supplement will have their funding honoured and the Department of Social Services will continue to process applications that have already been received. The Government will consider transitional arrangements for these providers as it develops alternative policy options.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the statement of 26 September which was seeking to explain and give effect to our pre-election commitment. And on that day Minister Andrews created the legislative instrument which the opposition are today seeking to disallow. It is yet another example of the opposition not accepting the result of the election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is bad enough that the opposition do not accept the fact that the Australian people voted for a change of government. It is bad enough that the opposition do not accept that the Australian people voted to abolish the carbon tax. This is yet another instance where the opposition do not accept that there was change of government, do not accept that the incoming government had a clear policy and do not accept the right of the government to give effect to that policy. What we are seeing here with these disallowance motions is the Australian Labor Party seeking to govern from the political grave. One would have thought they would have heeded the message from the last election and allowed the government to get on with its agenda. So it is disappointing that the opposition have moved these disallowance motions, which will only create unnecessary uncertainty in the aged-care sector. That is extremely unfortunate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I am on my feet I think it is important to draw the chamber's attention to Senator Polley's approach when we were in Senate estimates and aged care was before the Community Affairs Legislation Committee. Senator Polley seemed to be of the view that aged-care quality equals red tape, and red tape equals aged-care quality, because whenever this government has stated that it intends to seek to reduce red tape in the aged-care sector the opposition have said, 'What the government really wants to do is to reduce quality, to reduce standards.' I for one do not think we have yet reached some sort of regulatory nirvana in aged care. I think it is prudent for the government of the day, whoever they may be, to always look to see how red tape can be reduced in the aged-care sector. If aged-care workers, who those opposite profess have such an interest in, are spending time on paperwork that does not add to quality and does not add to care, that is time that those aged-care workers cannot be spending doing what they do best, and that is providing care to older Australians. So I take this opportunity to encourage those opposite, in particular Senator Polley, to take a fresh look at the issue of red tape and compliance—</span>

                    </a>  Yes, have an open mind. In a previous incarnation, in opposition, Senator Sinodinos has done some absolutely sterling work across a range of portfolios on proposals to reduce red tape and compliance. That role has now been assumed by the member for Kooyong, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Mr Frydenberg, who is doing that, as he does all things, with great enthusiasm. I have been keeping Mr Frydenberg updated on the work this government has undertaken to further reduce red tape.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was an important instance recently where some pricing guidelines drafted by the previous government would have required providers of aged-care services to provide, in excruciating and unnecessary detail in their product offerings, things like the number of lights in a roof, the number of lights in a facility, whether there was carpet or vinyl. There were some important out clauses: they were not actually going to insist that they specify the colour of the carpet. That is what those opposite considered to be taking a light-handed approach to regulatory issues. We determined that, yes, it is important that there be appropriate information for consumers, because it is very important that we have informed consumers in aged care, but we did not want to have such an excruciatingly unnecessary level of detail and to be requiring providers to document at every step how they had reached that point of the information they were disclosing. We decided we are going to have much more simplified guidelines. That is the sort of approach that we will take.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know I have digressed a little from the disallowance motions that are before us, Mr Deputy President. What we want to do is to work with the sector. We want to seek their views as to how this significant funding can best be deployed. I touched earlier on some of our concerns about the structure of the workforce supplement, the workforce compact. I want to go a little further into our pre-election policy. We said in our policy:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labor's Workforce Compact appears to be more about boosting union membership than improving aged care and adds to the regulatory quagmire without guaranteeing improved conditions for all workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Coalition believes that Labor's Workforce Compact is discriminatory as it does not apply to all workers. Under Labor, providers with 50 or more beds will need to enter into an Enterprise Bargaining Agreement (EBA) and comply with the conditions of the Workforce Supplement to access funding. Providers with less than 50 beds need not enter into an EBA, but must however comply with the conditions of the Workforce Supplement to access funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is always a little hook, always a little catch. The policy went on:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This aspect of the legislation was the key issue of contention at the … Senate inquiry into the Living Longer, Living Better package of Bills. The evidence was clear that many providers could not justify accessing the supplement as it fell far short of the actual cost of the proposed wage increases with providers having to meet on-costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Had Labor been serious about improving conditions in the sector, they could have worked through existing frameworks …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and the policy then mentioned some of those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we want to take a fresh look at this funding. As I said, it is quite a significant amount. We will look at this in the context of the significant consultation which we are going to undertake with the sector and a big part of that consultation is going to be looking for further ways to reduce red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged care and the ageing portfolio is an extremely exciting place to be working on. We do have an ageing population. The number of centenarians that we have in Australia is going to dramatically increase over the next 10 or 15 years. That represents a huge untapped resource in the nation, and not just centenarians but also those older Australians beyond the age of 65. We need to look for ways to harness that great national resource.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are Australians who, as they age, obviously need a little more help and that is where the aged-care part of the ageing portfolio comes into play. I am pleased that certainly in the last parliament there was a large degree of bipartisanship when it came to aged-care policy and aged-care reform. Yes, we do disagree with the Labor Party on the aged-care supplement, but I hope that it is possible to have a civil disagreement about one area of policy and that, more broadly in aged care, we perhaps can follow the model that there has been in disability where the various parties in parliament come together to work for a common outcome. I hope that is the case, because just as Australians with disability have little time for petty partisan point-scoring, I think that ageing Australians and particularly those in aged care and their families do not have much time for petty partisan point-scoring in this area either. They just want us to get on with the job, making sure that those who face some extra challenges as a result of ageing get the additional support they need. As I have indicated, Mr Deputy President, we will not be supporting this disallowance motion. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We entered into a lot of discussion and negotiation over the Living Longer Living Better package and I do think that we helped to make it a better package. This issue of better wages for aged-care workers has been very high on the agenda for a significant period of time and, although promises have been made in the past to address the poor wages of workers that work very hard in this sector, they have not been effectively delivered. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has happened is that in the past when there has been additional funding put into aged care, it has not actually been delivered to those that are doing the hard work at the coalface, and they are the aged-care workers. They are some of the lowest paid in the sector. In the previous aged-care inquiries in Perth and the subsequent one about the Living Longer Living Better legislation, we heard some horrendous stories about the low wages and the things that people had to do. We consulted a lot during that process. We will be supporting this disallowance motion because we believe that the Living Longer Living Better package was amended to address the issues of concern and this is the best way to ensure that increased wages are delivered to aged-care workers.</span>

She was honoured on an initiative by the Goulburn Street Primary School students of 5/6 Harrison—a group of children who have come, in a way, to adopt her as an elder statesman. She is a woman who has fought all her life for those less fortunate and those who were vulnerable to exiting education—she is a former teacher. She is a woman who I have held in great esteem and who has mentored me through my time in the Labor Party.</span>

                  <a href="CDK" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PERIS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  I rise today to talk about the appalling levels of domestic violence in the Northern Territory and the clear links to alcohol. Let me state for the record that I do support the responsible use of alcohol. Like most Australians, I too enjoy a social drink on occasions, but I stand here tonight to remind some of you—and perhaps inform others—that alcohol-related violence and crime is one of the biggest issues in the Northern Territory, and has been for decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The approach by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory to tackle alcohol abuse is simply not effective at addressing the devastating antisocial aspects of alcohol abuse. Alcohol abuse in the Northern Territory is causing untold grief and despair. It is ripping families apart. Sadly the victims of this abuse are mainly women, and tragically mainly Aboriginal women. Our women, my sisters, are being bashed and killed at an alarming rate. It is getting worse, and the links to alcohol have never been clearer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll briefly outline some of the shocking statistics before I discuss ideas that may help address the problem. In the last year there were 7,674 assaults in the Northern Territory, and 4,627 of them were domestic violence assaults. Around the same number, 4,631, were linked to alcohol abuse. These are only the assaults that are reported to police, and, as we all know, many go unreported. A recent report on domestic violence in the Northern Territory by KPMG found that only 18 per cent of domestic violence cases in the Northern Territory are not related to alcohol and drugs. That means four out of five domestic violence cases involve alcohol and drugs. That statistic should indicate just how serious a problem this is in the Northern Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a population basis, these rates of assault and violence are by far the highest of anywhere in the country. The Northern Territory Children's Commissioner, Howard Bath, has revealed statistics that show that Aboriginal women are 80 per cent more likely to be hospitalised for assault than a non-Indigenous woman. I'm going to repeat that: an Aboriginal woman is 80 times more likely to be hospitalised as a result of assault than any other woman. This is shocking, and Howard Bath makes it clear where the blame lies. He said, 'Alcohol is the worst factor by a country mile'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Things are not improving; they are getting worse. The previous Labor government in the Northern Territory, with Paul Henderson as Chief Minister, undertook a vast array of initiatives in relation to domestic violence and alcohol. The two most courageous—and most effective, I believe—were the mandatory reporting of domestic violence and the Banned Drinker Register, commonly known as the BDR. Mandatory reporting of domestic violence may not sound courageous and it may sound obvious, but the requirement for doctors and nurses to report suspected domestic violence does have the potential for women to avoid, or be prevented from, seeking medical attention for domestic violence related assaults.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was not a decision made lightly, but it was the right decision because we need people to speak out. We need domestic violence to be reported, and reporting rates have increased in recent years, which has been a good thing. Mandatory reporting of domestic violence was supported by both side of politics in the Northern Territory, and I am glad that the CLP government has kept it in place. But I am not glad that they have scrapped the Banned Drinker Register. In a rare show of unity, the BDR brought the then Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, and Mr Abbott together when earlier this year they both opposed the CLP government's decision to scrap it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The BDR was innovative and courageous. People convicted of alcohol related offences were placed on the BDR, and every takeaway alcohol point of sale in the Territory was electronically linked to the register to prevent these people from purchasing alcohol. Police describe the BDR as the best tool they had to fight violent crime. But, in coming to government in August last year, the CLP government went against the advice of the Northern Territory Police and so many others and scrapped the register completely. The CLP said that the requirement for everyone to show ID was too great a burden. The Northern Territory's Deputy Chief Minister, Dave Tollner, said that having to show ID treated all Territorians like criminals. He completely disregarded the point that it actually protected people by preventing criminals from purchasing alcohol. He completely ignored the fact that most people were already voluntarily handing over ID when using their credit cards or loyalty cards when purchasing alcohol. Around 2,500 problem drinkers were on the BDR when it was scrapped—all free to drink again. Of course, the BDR did not absolutely guarantee that they did not have any access to alcohol. But it absolutely made it harder. Now we will have no definitive statistics on whether the BDR actually reduced consumption of alcohol because, without explanation, the Northern Territory government has refused to release alcohol wholesale data. And for the same reason we do not know if alcohol sales have increased since it was scrapped. But there is a great belief in the sector that the reason the government will not release the data is that it will show the effectiveness of the BDR in reducing alcohol sales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do know is that the Northern Territory Police said it was best tool that they had for tackling alcohol related violence and crime. What we do know is that alcohol related assaults have increased by 11 per cent since it was scrapped and domestic violence has gone up by 15 per cent since it was scrapped, and admissions of drunks to our emergency departments in hospitals have greatly increased as a result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the increase has not been uniform across the Northern Territory. In fact, there is a tale of two towns, Nhulunbuy and Tennant Creek, both Territory towns with similar characteristics. They both have roughly the same population, they are remote and both serve as regional centres for outlying communities. But there is one key difference. Tennant Creek has eight times the rate of domestic violence of Nhulunbuy, so two similar towns but one has eight times as many women being bashed. In the last year there were 496 cases of domestic violence in Tennant Creek. There were only 61 in Nhulunbuy. A dramatic difference, but why? Nhulunbuy still effectively has the BDR; Tennant Creek does not. You cannot buy takeaway alcohol in Nhulunbuy without showing ID. And problem drinkers are banned. But in Tennant Creek there is nothing to stop anyone purchasing as much alcohol as they want whenever they like. The tap is back on and the rivers of grog are flowing again. And in just the first 12 months since the BDR was scrapped domestic violence in Tennant Creek increased by 47 per cent. I am not sure what more evidence is needed to prove that access to alcohol and domestic violence are clearly linked. The Northern Territory government have confirmed that they will keep the restrictions in place in Nhulunbuy. It defies common sense that they would not consider doing the same in Tennant Creek and other areas of the Territory where alcohol is causing such devastation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of the BDR is that it made it physically more difficult for a banned drinker to have access to alcohol. For years people have been legally banned from drinking alcohol via domestic violence orders and bail conditions but the evidence shows that when alcohol is freely available then these legislative bans have little effect. If we are to be serious about tackling domestic violence in the Northern Territory, then alcohol must be controlled at the point of purchase. While we are not doing this we are not taking the bashings and the deaths seriously. We have the technology to do this. But we are not using it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">By no means is domestic violence just an Indigenous issue. Non-Indigenous domestic violence tends to occur more behind closed doors and out of sight. And the violence in the Territory has not just been confined to domestic violence. Recently in Darwin we have seen the violent deaths of two men in our premier entertainment precinct and our most popular shopping centre. This is why I have advocated the need for us to look at the Newcastle lock-out model. Any model that reduces violence must be looked at.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vince Kelly, who is not only the head of the Northern Territory Police Association but also the President of the Police Federation of Australia, supports the Newcastle model. When the man who speaks on behalf of the nation's 56,000 police officers says that something is working to cut crime then I believe it should be looked at. Vince Kelly has also spoken against the scrapping of the BDR. He should be listened to. And I know many Aboriginal men who are extremely concerned about the rates of domestic violence; they are embarrassed by it—a shame job, as we call it in the Northern Territory. There is a great willingness to tackle domestic violence. But until we tackle alcohol properly we are not taking it seriously. Women are being bashed and killed. Let's use the tools we have to try and stop it. Let's do what works.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:04</span>):  I rise very briefly tonight to speak on something that occurred today in the other chamber, where proud coalition members from Murray-Darling Basin communities moved and second motions that disallowed a legislative instrument. It was an instrument which the previous minister, Minister Butler, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Water—in a cheap political act one day before the federal election proper started—introduced. I speak of the legislative instrument whereby the critically endangered category included the whole Murray-Darling Basin: the River Murray and associated wetlands, floodplains and groundwater systems from the junction with the Darling River to the sea. As for the scope, the number of communities and the number of businesses and farmlands that were physically encapsulated by that had an entirely new set of environmental regulations and designs overlaid on them as a result of this cheap political trick by the former minister. So I think it is great news for the 10 million Australians that live and work in the Murray-Darling Basin, who produce our food and raise their kids there, to have that taken away from them. I think of my own state of Victoria, where over the last number of years we have come to terms with the conversation around the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and its impact on our capacity to grow food and balance the needs of the rivers with the needs of the community. So to be 'using' these communities again and putting another onerous layer of green tape on people that just wanted to get on with the business of growing the great produce that they do right through Murray-River communities, particularly in Victoria, was just another blow to these communities that have seen drought and flood in recent times and also the uncertainty that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan conversation brought within those communities and that they had thought was over. So I stand with the New South Wales Irrigators' Council, who were championing this movement over in the other place, and similarly with the National Farmers' Federation, who were making very clear the desire of producers and communities to get rid of that extra layer of tape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is serious about decreasing regulation without sacrificing environmental standards. This goes to some of the commentary that Senator Fifield was making in the previous debate around aged care, that somehow the opposition thinks that this relationship is between quality—or in this case environmental outcomes—and the amount of red tape and green tape. It is simply not the case. Similarly, later this week I look forward to when we can work with the states to ensure that we do get bilateral approval and assessment processes under the EPBC Act so that communities and businesses can deal with one set of regulatory framework rather than multiple sets without decreasing environmental standards and outcomes. I think that is an important thing to reiterate, that that is what we actually need to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share with the chamber today some of the commentary from the stakeholders that are involved in this. I think that Tom Chesson from the National Irrigators' Council is very pleased. He bemoaned the fact that farmers were not actually consulted when Minister Butler rushed this critically endangered instrument through, despite the explanatory statement that was lodged with the instrument stating:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A draft conservation advice was placed on public exhibition, and public comments were sought as required by the Act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think that if you were going to overlay over these communities and these productive spaces you would actually talk to the irrigators—there are a fair few out there across the Murray-Darling Basin. The fact is that the act requires government to seek public comments and public commentary, and yet the former minister had not even talked to the National Irrigators' Council when he launched this legislative instrument. How typical of Labor. They will be the first ones in here tomorrow complaining about the government, but they were the ones who did not consult. They made policy on the run, and this is an absolute corker of an example. I am absolutely rapt that Mark Coulton and Andrew Broad and I think Angus Taylor and—help me out colleagues—</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr President. It was actually a group called the Humane Society International. Now you want to talk about foreign investment problems and our agricultural industries being controlled by foreign boardrooms, this was a classic case of the then minister for the environment being controlled by a foreign activist group. The Humane Society International championed the listing of the Murray-Darling Basin and Macquarie Marshes et cetera under this particular legislative instrument and category. So rather than using good process, the former Labor government, as they rushed and hurtled towards the last election, typically threw this in as the 'kitchen sink'. They thought it was going to get them the votes that they might have needed. I see Senator Ludlam from the Greens in WA is here. Labor might have needed a couple of percentage points from Green votes right across Australia or to get back some of their core vote, the left-leaning progressive Labor voters who bled to the Greens—hats off, Greens; hats off—over successive elections. Butler was trying his very best to hold some of the seats that he knew Labor were facing losing. It is why they swapped the leaders when they did; it is why they ended up putting in legislative instruments to keep their mates happy. But the Australian people had the last laugh, didn't they? They saw through the farce that was the previous three governments—Rudd, Gillard, Rudd—and made their views very, very clear on election day. They were very clear on who they wanted to take this country forward and the program that they wanted implemented.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the very short amount of time I have left to me, I would like to say, on the second last day that we sit here for 2013, we are a frustrated government in the Senate as the opposition refuses to accept the outcome of the election, refuses to accept that the Australian people want the carbon tax repealed. Regional Australia wants the carbon tax repealed; the communities and businesses in the Murray-Darling Basin want the carbon tax repealed so that we can get on irrigating, so that we can get on growing great food and so that we can get on processing and manufacturing the high quality products that come out of the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator LUDLAM:</span>
                  </a>  Yes, so keep an eye out for me. I hope to be heading west at 800 kilometres an hour by the time the adjournment motion is moved tomorrow night, which is obviously the last sitting night for the calendar year 2013, so I hope you will forgive me for taking the opportunity tonight to offer up a few reflections on life and work in this place. As anyone who is watching the ongoing debacle of the Western Australian count, recount, court challenge and so on would be well aware, there is nothing quite like a political near-death experience to remind you how much you value your time in here, your colleagues, the achievements and challenges and, most of all, the huge privilege we have to work in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If anyone is watching this on a ratty little YouTube video after the fact or is listening on the radio, I can confirm that the chamber is basically empty, as it so often is, particularly at adjournment time. So my audience tonight is, with great respect, not the people in here but mostly people outside this building, particularly people who could not be bothered to cast a vote on 7 September. They either did not turn up at all and risked a fine or showed up and, as our scrutineers discovered—and there were an alarmingly large number of people who did this—took the time not to vote but to draw reasonably detailed renderings of genitalia or make some sort of swearing contribution on their ballot paper. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of Australians do not vote. Younger people or people who are simply disillusioned for whatever reason—because of the general idea that no matter who you vote for some politician always seems to get elected, because of some affinity with Russell Brand's spectacular rant over not bothering to vote because the whole system is just a waste of time or because of the view that their vote does not matter, that there is no point—this is partly for you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to congratulate my government colleagues for making their way over to those benches and commiserate with my ALP colleagues. It has been fascinating to observe the Abbott team, who were so brutally effective in opposition—and hats off to them for it—turn out to be absolutely hopeless at being the government. It has been absolutely hilarious. They are just not very good at it. The more practice they get, the worse they seem to become at it. It is extraordinarily entertaining. They are like the kid who accidentally ties his own shoelaces together. They are stumbling around from debacle to disaster in a series of spasmodic policy lurches that would be hilarious if people's lives were not being ruined all over the place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard, even earlier on today, quite a bit about a mandate—'Respect my mandate'—from Tony Abbott and various others in the government. But this is one of the most perceptive things that I think has ever come out of Mr Abbott's mouth. He said on 1 December 2009, coincidently the first day he was the Leader of the Opposition:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Oppositions are not there to get legislation through. Oppositions are there to hold the government to account, and unless we are confident a piece of legislation is beyond reasonable doubt in the national interest, it is our duty, as the opposition, to vote it down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was actually quite perceptive. It was quite an effective rendering of what it means to be an opposition or a crossbench senator in here. I am not a member of the executive. Your mandate as the executive depends on your ability to weld together a working majority in the House of Representatives and to be able to pass legislation through this parliament. The people who voted for me and the people who voted for the majority of those in this chamber did not vote to have you destroy the effective action we have managed to pull together on global warming, which is surely the most significant challenge that confronts our country. They certainly did not vote for me to just wave through the kinds of obscenities that are occurring at the moment in the name of the national interest, depending on various tortured definitions wheeled out by George Brandis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  Order! You need to refer to someone by their correct title.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  You asked me to interrupt you, and I did.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator LUDLAM:</span>
                  </a>  I warned you that you would need to keep an eye out. Senator Brandis is a manifestly inadequate Attorney-General because we are seeing the global surveillance industrial complex reeling under a steady drip of revelations as to its inner workings—and these won't stop; this is probably just the beginning. At last the truth is starting to come home here in Australia. The government's formidable foreign policy objective of alienating a different country every single day has been a profound success, with Timor-Leste most recently added to that list. Well done on that!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has obviously made parliament a really interesting place in which to work. In the last sitting fortnight we have been able to block the reintroduction of temporary protection visas, have I think taken a big step towards rescuing university funding, have stepped up in defence of the Clean Energy Act and most recently the Climate Change Authority, have forced your spectacularly awkward backdown on schools funding—and I think most people are still trying to work out exactly what it is that you are up to—and have brought a measure of honesty and common sense to the national discussion about government debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is said that calm seas do not make good sailors. I am very pleased to report to this chamber, on behalf of colleagues and friends back home, that there is a remarkable feeling of determination setting in within the Greens. We have had a big surge of new members and it has been a delight to see new energy come into our tough and resilient party. I am very proud of everything that we have achieved. I am a bit daunted by what is to come but confident that collectively we are up to it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I farewell Felicity tonight, who has been working in my office for five years, effectively, since day one, and who is off to an extraordinary international adventure. Thanks, Flick, for everything that you have contributed to getting us this far. And I farewell Giovanni, who has left us and is also leaving our shores. I think it is good to get out of this place from time to time, because it reminds you when you get back what an extraordinary place this is. Thanks to both of you, for all your dedicated work in getting us to where we are today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to thank everyone who put their hand up to be a candidate in 2013, as you took your place to represent and advocate for our collective work. You made us proud, you made me proud and you made a difference. In whatever capacity you are out there working for a green future, either big 'G' or small 'g', make sure you rest up, take time out to appreciate everything that is good about our home state and try to unplug from the churn, at least for a brief spell. I am offering this advice freely and unsolicited to all my colleagues in this place. The work is relentless. We are away from home a lot of the time, away from family and away from friends. I hope everybody manages to get a good break and come back refreshed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you are listening to this and you think your vote does not matter, just consider for a moment the margin in the ballot in Western Australia, which is still up in the air. Tomorrow we will have a directions hearing in the High Court and we will see where that goes. Senator Pratt, who is here, is strung up in exactly the same awkward situation as I and a number of other candidates are. The margin swung between 14 votes or maybe 12 votes or possibly even one vote. If you are out there and you think your vote does not matter, bear that in mind for a second. Perhaps one individual said, 'I can't be stuffed; what on earth is the point?' That vote could have been the one that swung the outcome in a different direction and changed the balance of power in this chamber, in the Australian Senate. That is how powerful your individual vote is, whether you know it or not. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having worked with people from Burma and Tibet and with Palestinian refugees, and having spent time in detention centres with people who have fled war, terror and totalitarianism overseas, I know that a vote is a precious thing. If all you do with your democracy is drop a piece of paper into a box every three years, then you are doing it wrong. Democracy is obviously about a lot more than that. But at the very least I would encourage people to take another look at the shenanigans and the goings-on in this place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mostly we are people of good heart. Most people who show up here—not necessarily in the Greens but in the major parties—take a big pay cut, and most people turn up here to serve, one way or another, our view of what the public and the national interest is. Sometimes it can all go wrong at an institutional level or once you scale up these collective endeavours, but nonetheless most people show up in here, I think, with goodwill and a willingness to serve. I have very much enjoyed my time here and look forward to many long years, with Senator Pratt and with others, as we bring the Green agenda forward. </span>
